<p>Sarah Leavitt's graphic memoir, <em>Tangles: A Story about Alzheimer's, My Mother, and Me</em>, looks deceptively simple at first glance. The sparse, line-art images are entirely in black and white, and the framing of each panel is drawn to the required size but the borders are not transgressed.  It looks very traditional for a slice-of-life comic.</p>

<p>But the joy of <em>Tangles</em> -- and there is joy throughout this difficult, sad, and painful memoir -- comes from the hidden complexity in these images and the nuanced way Leavitt examines her own conflicted feelings through the visual.  Though a first glance might suggest that the images in <em>Tangles</em> are secondary to the story, in reality Leavitt's work is so good because of the flawless intermingling of words and images, where the images challenge and belie the words.</p>

<p>I think of this as a perfect example of the graphic memoir genre.</p>

<p>But I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>

<p><em>Tangles</em> is Sarah Leavitt's memoir of watching her mother succumb to Alzheimer's disease.  Intensely personal and honest, Leavitt details her experiences of watching her educated, intelligent mother lose her faculties.  She deals openly with the family's early denial, troubles coping, and conflicted feelings of relief.  The memoir is, at it's core, a sensitive and moving portrayal of Leavitt's mother, Midge.  But it's also a portrait of a family in pain and a daughter in deep flux.</p>

<p>There is distance, physical and emotional, between Leavitt and her family.  They are in Fredericton while she is in Vancouver.  Leavitt's parents are culturally Jewish but do not practice.  Though they are liberal, their community is not, and Leavitt must leave Fredericton to discover and embrace her sexuality as a lesbian.  (On the other hand, Leavitt's sister becomes more conservative, eventually marrying an Orthodox Jewish man.)  These spaces between the characters allow for the reader to examine a series of internal tensions that trouble and define Leavitt's character as depicted in the memoir.</p>

<p>As I said before, the images and text are in a constant conversation with one another, and occasionally they seem to disagree.  This serves to underscore a central motif in the text: internal tension.  Leavitt's character in the text is caught between her desire to help and nurse her mother and her own feelings of impatience with her decline; her desire to disagree with care choices made by her father and sister and her guilt at being the absent daughter; her need to be with her mother and her relief upon each return to Vancouver.  There are contrasts throughout that demonstrate these internal tensions, but the one that resonated with me was the depiction of Fredericton.</p>

<p>Leavitt's character tells us that Fredericton, as a city, was too small and too confining for her; she had to get out to really find out who she was.  And terrible things happen in Fredericton -- Leavitt is cautious about displays of sexuality in the small, conservative city (and indeed, in one harrowing scene, is taunted with calls of "dyke" by local boys who see her holding her ailing mother's hand).  These moments are painful.  If one read only the words in <em>Tangles</em>, the depiction of Fredericton is wholly negative.</p>

<p>And yet with her exquisitely simple style, Leavitt's drawings of Fredericton -- especially the pedestrian bridge and Odell Park -- are disarmingly charming.  (Full disclosure: Fredericton was my home for four years.  When I read <em>Tangles</em> for the first time, the understated sketch of the pedestrian bridge brought me to tears of homesickness.)  The city is not depicted as exclusively negative; these lovely images nuance Leavitt's construction of the town and demonstrate her own ambivalence.  While Leavitt's character doesn't consider Fredericton her home, it's clear that she finds something redeeming about the space; this acts as a metaphor for her conflicted feelings about her family and her desire to be with them and with her partner and her life in Vancouver at the same time. Fredericton's ambivalent construction in the text is very much a way to tell the story of Leavitt's character's own ambivalence about the distance that separates her from her family.</p>

<p>In this text, Leavitt is also able to work out -- or at least examine -- some of her worst fears about her own likelihood of developing Alzheimer's.  Leavitt constructs herself in the memoir as very much the image of the ailing Midge; far more than her sister, Leavitt draws striking physically resemblances throughout the text between herself and her mother through curly hair, fine features, and even posture and body stamp.  Leavitt's character repeatedly mentions her own terrible memory, contrasting it to her mother's long-term memory that functions well into the progression of the disease.  Leavitt's character works to strengthen her brain by writing with her non-dominant hand and constantly challenging herself; she draws herself in the image of her mother, but seeks to change the future for herself by defying the potential disease state.  Here we see the tension between the comforting connection to her mother's image (and repetition in behaviours, such as receiving comfort from her mother as a child and now bestowing comfort on her mother as an adult) and the fear of what that connection may represent.</p>

<p>There is more to say about this memoir -- about how Leavitt depicts the love between her parents, about the construction of bodies through illness and the violations we endure, about death and mourning among atheists and agnostics, about ritual, and about identity (who are we when our memories are stripped away from us?) -- and I'll revisit <em>Tangles</em> again here at Graphixia soon.  But in the meantime, read it if you haven't.  It's painful and heart-wrenching, but also funny, touching, warm, and passionately honest.  Leavitt's first foray into graphic memoir really is a triumph.</p>
