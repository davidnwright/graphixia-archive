<p>In our discussions about comics, we've tended to orbit around superheroes, post-war graphic "novels," and the way these comic books are reflected and received in popular culture. So let's call this post a "serious turn." What hasn't been covered up to now, and it's a big oversight, is the woodcut novel. The woodcut novel, a kin of William Blake's illuminating printing, etching on copper plates, in this instance refers to a "wordless" novel made up of a sequence of images produced by etching onto plates of wood (or linoleum, metal, rubber, etc.) in relief (like, backwards).</p>

<p>These "wordless" graphic novels--and they truly are "graphic" novels, made up of long, complex narratives that rely solely on	the image sequence to covey the plot of the story--tend to build on religious or epic narratives. Their stories are about rises and downfalls, the perils of sin, but also of social justice, anxieties about technology, mechanization, dehumanization, and mass production. In fact, they tend to deal with these subjects in a less latent way than comic books do now. The woodcuts require a deep engagement with the image and thus do not need to rely on the interpretations of Captain America's runaway capitalism, or Fantastic Four's technological dehumanization, or Spiderman's atomic anxieties. Instead, the reader must work to create her own words from the etchings on the page, creating a story that is at once the author's, but as much the reader's, for she is deeply invested in the politics of its making.</p>

<p>One of the best known artists in the medium (or genre as long as we're talking comic books) is Lynd Ward (if your into it: The Library of America just published a handsome two volume set of his most popular woodcut novels). The picture above is fairly representative of his work and hints at the prevalence of the detailed lines, and careful crafting that went into it. While he cannot be credited with inventing the format--that honour probably goes to<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_Masereel">Frans Mesereel</a>, but I'm just spitballing--he can certainly be credited as its most popular purveyor. The list of comic book artists indebted to Ward's woodcuts (and the etchings of others, such as Masereel and<a href="http://www.glenbow.org/collections/art/research/hyde.cfm">Laurence Hyde</a>) is long: Art Spiegelman, Will Eisner, George Herriman, Marjane Starapi, Jason Lutes, Joe Sacco, Seth, all have a style that reflects the lines, scratches, and scrapes of woodcut artists. Once you've feasted on a few woodcut novels, it's hard to read any black and white comic book out there without recalling the work of early woodcut artists such as Ward and Masereel.</p>

<p>In his introduction to Ward's collected works, Art Spiegelman notes, as he walks through a gallery show of Ward's work, "I remember slowing down to notice that a number of the prints on display depicted trees and forests. I thought about the poetry of patiently carving into a dead tree to make a print on paper that commemorated the once living thing" (xxv). That's a perceptive comment from Spiegelman, as usual.</p>

<p>Given that woodcut novels tend toward stories about depression-era anxieties about labour, social justice, runaway consumption, and the dehumanizing effect of the corporate industrial complex, the process of their creation is worth careful consideration. First of all, it's a different process than anything we normally associate with modern comic book production. No sketchbooks, or inkers, or colourists, only an artist using a graver (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burin">burin</a>) painstakingly (and I imagine there were several painful moments when the burin slipped, gashing a finger or two) carving lines in a block of wood or linoleum.</p>

<p>The move to produce woodcuts looks like a calculated response to the anxieties mentioned above. It seems to offer a <em>riposte</em> to modes of mass production, and the loss of a tactile connection to the goods we produce. It's certainly a different perspective on mass production, one that in itself gave rise to the modern, disposable, drugstore comic book. The etched block can be placed directly in the printing press, or inked up, and rolled out onto pages, then stitched to together by hand. It's quite literally "hand-crafted" and always so, even if it is then mass-produced on the printing press.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting things about woodcut images for me, is the dominance of black. It's the first thing that strikes me when I encounter a woodcut--the black. Quite simply, because of the effort that must be made to produce whitespace in relief etching (the white space is the carved out part of the block because it does not hold the ink), blacks tend to dominate the images. This feature is even more evident when the reader returns to images created with the pen or pencil. The whitespace leaps out and seems deserted and overly bright in contrast with the deep, dark, overwhelming blacks of woodcuts.</p>

<p>The image above is from Milt Gross'<em> He Done Her Wrong</em> (subtitled "The Great American Novel (with no words)). Itself a "wordless novel," and a funny, well-rendered one at that, the whitespace frees things up and in fact makes it funny. There's rarely anything funny about the woodcut novel (especially in the Ward, Giacomo Patri, Masereel tradition) because the blacks overwhelm the page and make it claustrophobic, dark, depressing. All this to say that the comic genre yields so much of its interpretive power to the image itself, the way it is constructed, it's use of shadow and line, that the mode of its production (burin or pen) is essential and reflected in its reception. As George A. Walker tells us the woodcut "is often referred to as the art of the white line because it is a subtractive process that works from black to white. To make a black line the artist must carve two white lines, since the wood must be removed from both sides of the line that is to print" (15). Whereas, with the pen, the process is additive, with the pen filling the whitespace with lines. The juxtaposition of these two styles of graphic storytelling is a rich source for interpretation and inspiration.</p>

<P>In the end, a "serious turn" suggests that the woodcut comic book is just a damn good way to spend an afternoon; it reveals itself slowly but yields a lasting impression (Groucho Marx eyebrow twitch...).</p>
