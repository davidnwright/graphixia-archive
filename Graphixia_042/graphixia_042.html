<p>One of the standard complaints about the superhero genre of comic books is that the female form is grossly exaggerated, highly sexualized and, most often, presented as scantily clad as possible. The concern, typically, is that these characters are often two dimensional and set a standard of unrealistic expectations for the predominantly male readership, and they have the added effect of ostracizing female readers who are disturbed by the common trope of the oversized breasts, undersized waists and jutting hips that</p>

<p>are the norm for women in comics. What often goes unaddressed, however, is that this	hyper-sexuality and exaggeration of form is just as prevalent (if not moreso) for the male heroes and their sidekicks in comics as well. The	male form, presented with swollen pectorals, washboard abs and tree-trunk	quads, is arguably just as unattainable an ideal, yet the presentation receives little to no complaint, nor is it commonly branded as purely	homoerotic despite comics’ predominantly male readership. Why is this the case?

<p>Comics have a long history of presenting characters in a highly sexualized way, from the earliest images of thick-eyelashed, wide-hipped Mary Jane Watson / Parker to the chiseled jaw and powerful form of Bruce Wayne, and over the seventy-plus years of mass-market superhero comics, little has changed in these representations. The idealistic bodies we are offered in comics, both male and female, are now an expectation for readers, and not seeing this physical shape on our heroes and their counterparts would now be a shock in the medium. There have certainly been exceptions to this rule, however, but they have come not from the superhero genre but more heady, academic fare such as Dave Sim’s “Cerebus,” Terry Moore’s “Strangers in Paradise” and the various imprints of the “Big Two” – Marvel and DC – that have been branded as being marketed towards mature readers because of more advanced thematic content. The fact remains that superhero comics are sexist, both from a feminist as well as a masculinist standpoint. Or are they? Perhaps, given the decibel level of the complaints from gender theorists towards the exaggerated female form in comics, we have yet to acknowledge that there may be more to the derogatory labels than is readily noticed at first glance.</p>

<p>Firstly, and even more basely than arguing that comics are essentially soft-core pornography, the hyper-sexualized form is easier for an artist to draw. Anyone who has taken first-year anatomy first learns the muscle structures underneath however many layers of girth we add onto it, and this is presented as the simple ideal – readily available and standardized, easy to sketch out almost blindly to the tune of twenty-two pages a month. Spandex allows the artist to dispense with the folds and lines of clothes and the individualized nuances of parcels of scattered fat, as he recalls the base model which he is drawing; the expectation for the superhero artist is predictability of the familiar physical body and, more importantly, a speedy delivery of his or her work. The logistics are clean and simple: deliver what you’ve been taught, and make sure it’s on time. One can see the application of this in even the earliest Superman and Spider-man comics – there is no need, given these heroes’ powers, for them</p>

<p>to be bulky and sexualized. Superman’s powers are fueled by the sun, not by his musculature, and Spider-man by his radioactive blood, not by his lean rame. The fact remains that these male characters, and all others like them, are presented with exaggerated physical forms and a body fat content in the very low single digits.</p>

<p>This first point, however, is too easy an out – many comics’ artists, such as Frank Quitely and John Cassaday, attempt to break this mold on a regular basis, giving us heroes who are more “realistic” in their representation of the human form, as they spend vast amounts of time – resulting in frequent delays of books – in order to present their craft as something other than simple mimicry. More important than the simple logistics of the industry and the turnaround time for the artist trying to fill pages is the fact that these are our heroes, bastions of virtue and standards for moral good.</p>

<p>The superhero genre is populated predominantly by characters who understand the world in terms of black and white, of a simple good versus evil binary that requires a standardized justice to be dispensed to maintain. We look to them, both as children and as adults, with expectation on how to act when faced with difficult or morally challenging encounters – it must be remembered that comics were, at first, a pedagogical tool in order to distribute the classics in a more accessible way. It is hardly surprising then that these heroes, who are paradigms of virtue and who are often very unrealistic in terms of their morally definitive nature are also paradigms of the physical form. These heroes, male and female, make moral choices that most of us are incapable of making, from patrolling the streets to ensure that justice is being meted out against those who would do society wrong, to sacrificing the completeness of the individual private life for a greater sense of the common good. We turn to these heroes at an early age for pedagogical examples on the platonic form of how to behave, of the essential nature of moral certitude; this applies not only to the male characters of Superman and Batman, but to the proud and equally powerful female characters of Wonder Woman and Power Girl. Why then would the content not be expressed outwardly in their forms? These heroes are our ideals in a moral sense, as we aspire to have the courage to make the same choices they do when in their monthly difficult circumstances – their bodies are, predictably, also presented as ideals, just as platonic and unattainable as their ability to choose good over evil at every turn. The ripped chests and swelled breasts of our heroes are not meant to ostracize or alienate, but to show us that these characters are meant to be aspired to. Their outward appearance, both for males and females, is only as exaggerated as the binaristic perspectives they hold on right and wrong.</p>

<p>The stories presented in the superhero genre of comic books are fantastic, meant to entertain and draw us in to an idealized representation of the world in which evil is readily identifiable as such, and good is always present to be able to confront it head on. The stories themselves are exaggerations of expectation, are emphasized versions of the encounters we face in our lives that remind us of the importance of our choices. The exaggerated bodies of our heroes, present even when dialogue is not, reflect the idyllic nature of their characters and remind us that, however unattainable, we should be pursuing these ideals in our every action. The hyper-sexualized male form and its female counterpart, then, are images of what society at large (reflected in the artists’ renderings) suggests that we should aspire to even if these ideals are impossible to achieve.</p>

<p>It is a testament to our age, for good or for ill, that we find idealistic representations contemptible – one does not see these offenses taken in Greek sculpture or renaissance painting. Instead of platonic representations through which we can aspire, we are distracted (and perhaps limited) by ambiguity and synthesis. In recognizing the medium of the comic book and the superhero genre, one might apply the same logic here that Aristotle prescribes to art more generally: “The aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance, and this, and not the external manner and detail, is true reality.”</p>
