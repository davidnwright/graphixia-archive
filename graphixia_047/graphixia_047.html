<p>In the last six weeks or so <a href="http://bookriot.com/author/bgray/">I started a new blogging gig over at Book Riot</a>, which is a new online book discussion community.  I enjoy blogging for them, not least because sometimes people send me free books for review now.  The lovely folks at House of Anansi Press sent me Robert Lepage, Marie Michaud, and Fred Jourdain's <em>The Blue Dragon</em>, <a href="http://bookriot.com/2011/11/11/review-the-blue-dragon-by-robert- lepage- marie-michaud-and-fred-jourdain/">which I reviewed for Book Riot last weekish</a>.  Since that review, though, I've been thinking a lot about <em>The Blue Dragon</em> and how it challenges my notions of how I engage with graphic narratives.</p>

<P>Like the rest of the Graphixia team, I'm an English scholar by training.  I know about words and word-like stuff.  I love graphic narratives (obviously) and like to think I've become a good critical reader of visual texts (see post history for evidence for disagreement), but I realized while reading <em>The Blue Dragon</em> that I am still guilty of privileging the written narrative over the graphic; that is, I look first to the story, and then look to the ways the images augment or complicate or ironize the story.  I'm still not, I think, reading as a cohesive whole.</p>

<p><em>The Blue Dragon </em>made this clear to me because the visual imagery is so central; page after page the dialogue is subsumed by the graphics, as you can see in these (admittedly terrible and from my cell phone, sorry) pictures.  (The book is a gorgeous, huge 9x12 volume and hard to scan.)  If I were to minimize the visual in this text I would miss the whole point; its sweeping, epic power emerges from these magnificent painterly images.  They are ignored at my own peril.</p>

<p>I don't think this is strictly, for me, a matter of lacking critical tools -- I've read all the old standbys like <em>Understanding Comics</em>. I think it comes down to the fact that I have been trained and wired to consume texts in a particular way, so if I'm not consciously foregrounding the visual, my default position is to privilege the story.</p>

<p>Part of the resolution, I think, is for me to read more of these sorts of graphic narratives where the visual imagery refuses to be seen as merely a servant to the more traditional narrative.  In effect, I need to retrain myself to focus on the visual.  My taste normally runs to sparse imagery (like <em><a title="#34 Memory and Mimesis: Internal Tension in Sarah Leavitt’s Tangles" href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2011/08/01/34-memory-and-mimesis - internal-tension-in-sarah-leavitts-tangles/">Tangles: A Memoir of Alzheimer's, My Mother, and Me</a></em>or <em><a title="#18 Louis Riel’s Legacy" href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2011/04/01/louis-riels-legacy/"> Louis Riel: A Comic Strip Biography</a></em>, both of which I've discussed before on Graphixia); in such comics, I am often rewarded for primarily seeing the visual images as complimentary or complicating factors rather than the main event. I'm working on stepping out of that comfort zone and focusing more on texts where the driving force is the visually imagery.</p>

<p><em>The Blue Dragon</em> is a good first step in this direction.  The imagery is theatrical, grand, and fantastic in its depth -- Jourdain's painting-like illustrations evoke both the central motif of the commodification of art and the larger emotional canvas of the narrative.  I can't default to the written narrative here because so much is primarily in the images.</p>

<p>So here I start rethinking the privilege of prose and elevating the image in my conception of comics.</p>

<p>Say that three times fast.</p>
