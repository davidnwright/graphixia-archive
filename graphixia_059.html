<p><strong>I have to admit to knowing almost nothing about Cerebus, Dave Sim’s magnum opus of 300 issues. I have only heard vague rumblings of Sim’s genius and eccentricity. Scott assures me that the series becomes complex and literary, as Brenna’s post on the “Melmoth” Oscar Wilde sequence will show.  My problem in writing this post is that I couldn’t just jump to the genius issues. I had to start at the beginning. And the beginning of Cerebus is nothing much: funny animal as Conan the Barbarian about sums it up. Many associate Cerebus with Howard the Duck, a comic that I never read as a kid because it violated my sense of realism, which is funny considering that I read a ton of super hero comics.</strong></p>

<p>Apparently, Cerebus began as a parody of the “Sword and Sorcery” genre. It is a truism that in order to parody something, you must understand it in detail. Because I never had any affinity for this genre, a parody of it is more or less meaningless to me. The one time my attention sparked during the first ten issues was when a character spoke in the manner of Foghorn Leghorn from the Warner Brothers cartoons. But I had no idea why an artist would do such a thing. The “accent” seemed as out of place as an aardvark seeking adventure and treasure.</p>

<p>Because I was having trouble reading Cerebus in a disciplined way, I decided that the only thing to do was skip ahead. I decided to read every tenth issue, and so jumped to issue #20. This move was fortuitous because this issue marks a key transition for Sim. The serial nature of many comics frequently entails several shifts in approach. The artwork and themes transform over time so that a comic can become radically different from how it started out. Because Cerebus is mostly a one-man work (Gerhard, Sim’s background artist, teamed up with him in 1984) rather than a comic produced by different teams of artists and writers, these transformations bear the mark of an auteur, reflecting Sim’s relationship to comics and the world. Cerebus ultimately shifted to political and religious themes as the comic became less of a genre parody and more the expression of a worldview. Issue #20 is an important step in the development of this worldview.</p>

<P>If you unstaple the pages of the comic, you can put them together like a simple jigsaw puzzle so that they form a large image of Cerebus’ body. The dialogue of the issue weaves around this image. As Cerebus moves through the plot of the comic, his relationship to his own body determines which conversation he is in. The comic essentially does away with panels, and plays fast and loose with the left to right, top to bottom reading process. The reader has to do some mental adjustments to his or her comics reading paradigm to follow along. Because Cerebus is drugged, these adjustments correspond with the main character’s predicament; he is initially disoriented and confused. In reorienting the conventional comic reading path, Sim is able to play with ideas of mind and body, inside and outside, and hedonism and austerity.</p>

<p>Through the issue, Cerebus conducts two conversations, one with Perce and Wenda, who are “Cirinists,” a group devoted to an austere matriarchal religion opposed to fun of any kind, and one with Suenteus Po, the founder of “Illusionism,” that celebrates intoxication and bodily pleasures.  If he is within the outlines of his body, he speaks to Po, while if he is outside of those outlines, he speaks to Perce and Wenda.  Apart from Cerebus’ the voices are disembodied, so instead of speech bubbles with tails, we see radiant bubbles for the Cirinists and double-lined bubbles for Suenteus Po. After an initial disorientation, we soon sort out who is speaking and what order we should read in. Our brains are  like cameras on autofocus: what was initially blurry becomes clear as the lenses adjust. So, although we depend upon conventions to understand how to read a comic, if those conventions disappear, it does not take us long to figure out the new pattern, as long as there is a pattern.</p>

<p>Presumably, most western comics are arranged so that the narrative proceeds from the top right of the page to the bottom left of the page, moving left to right along each row because they emulate text, so the organization of text determines the organization of images. But while there is a necessity that text move in that direction, there is no necessity for images to do so, partly because we don’t read each panel in the same way that we read the sequence of panels. Rather, our eyes move over the panel following the dictates of perspective in art: vanishing points, focal points, and such. Cerebus # 20 is an example of comics that reflects on the medium’s relationship to text and attempts to establish a different visual order. Thus the issue is an exercise in disorienting and re-orienting, so the reader enters an altered state like that a drug might bring on. We can conceive of the struggle between hedonism and austerity that Cerebus mediates in the narrative as also being a struggle between creativity and convention in the comics medium that Sim struggles with to bring this comic out of convention-bound parody into a philosophical and aesthetic space in its own right.</p>

<p>Readers of my previous posts will know that one of the things that fascinates me is the presentation of double worlds in comics, the way comics use their mapping of time onto space to create two worlds operating simultaneously. For instance, the world of the super hero and the world of mundane reality. Issue #20 is Cerebrus’ entry into that aspect of comics. Perhaps one the reasons I had trouble getting to grips with Sim’s comic is that the Sword and Sorcery genre, however fantastic, tends to be a one-world genre even in Cerebus’ parodic model. You are either in it or out of it in that Dungeons and Dragons sort of way. Here we see a narrative and artistic doubling that remains patently fantastic, but adds an interesting complexity that goes beyond Foghorn Leghorn voices.</p>
