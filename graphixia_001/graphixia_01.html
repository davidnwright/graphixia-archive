<p>AAAA The superhero's identity, the way that it condenses a repressed identity in costume and metonymy while producing an identity split in the charater who becomes the hero, has a surprising  affinity with identity themes in "serious" graphic narratives. In Chris Ware's <em>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth</em>, Jimmy's Superman pyjamas overtly play off of the superhero motif. Through a visual inversion, the doughy, infantile Jimmy is the diametrical opposite of Superman; yet the "S" on Jimmy's chest and the way Ware's drawings keep drawing our attention to it, insist that Jimmy's quest for his father has something to do with Superman.</p>

<p>Alison Bechdel's graphic memoir, <em>Fun Home: A Family Tragic Comic</em>, makes no sly iconic reference to superhero comics, but Bruce Bechdel, Alison's father, wrestles as much with the split in his identity as any costumed superhero. <em>Fun Home</em> presents Alison Bechdel's open lesbian identity as built upon the closeted homosexuality of her father who may have committed suicide because he was unable to handle the contradiction between his outward identity as heterosexual family man and his "inner" identity as a gay man. Like Bruce Wayne, Bruce Bechdel is something of a slave to the suit, the costume. <andrea>to Batman's (and perhaps all superheroes') </andrea> "identity" is metonymy, the associations through costume, tools that allow Batman to show himself while also being masked or veiled. Batman must be simultaneously overtly on display and hidden. In <em>Fun Home</em> the same is true of Bruce Bechdel. Bruce Bechdel's veiled homosexuality is revealed and screened simultaneously by his house restoration which becomes a baroque fun house of mirrors. The house is a metonymy for his self-veiling but also for his desire to come out. This paradox is entirely along the lines of Bruce Wayne/ Batman's "here I am, masked" contradiction. An obsession with details stands for the characters' inner being as the signifiers of veiling and unveiling. This metonymy both says something about the character, gives clues to his or her secret identity, as it also acts as an alibi for, or distraction from, that identity.</p>

<p>Alison serves as an interpreter of that identity, akin to the person obsessed with revealing the real human being beneath the costume. Part of the set-up of the superhero identity is the person who "almost knows" that the hero is such and such a person. In this role in <em>Fun Home</em> Alison searches for the confirming proof that Bruce was indeed gay. She reads all the signs (an obsession with flowers and appearance) and interprets the evidence (the fact that Bruce has been arrested for suspicious activity with a minor), but remains in doubt as to his truth: do his dalliances count as thorough going homosexuality?</p>
