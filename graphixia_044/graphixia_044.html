<p>The key difference between film, particularly animation, and comics is that comics don't move. Rather, our eyes move over the panels in a way that is both linear and sequential and ex/implosive and radiating. A great irony of the superhero comic is that the substance of its plot is all action, hence the preponderance of "POW!s" and "BAM!s" and heroes frozen in poses of swinging, slugging, flying, and leaping. Furthermore, the superhero comic is predicated on the momentous event, the apocalyptic destruction of the world is perpetually on the horizon.</p>

<p>It is not surprising then that comics that react against the superhero comic tend to downplay the notion of action, even to the point of nullifying it altogether. Yes, <em>Jimmy Corrigan, The Smartest Kid on Earth</em> includes events, but not particularly momentous ones, at least not in the contemporary part of the story. Jimmy's foot gets run over. His Dad's car get stolen. "POW" is replaced by the "drip" of Jimmy's nose. Think of all those frames that are effectively "still life" or empty spaces.</p>

<p>Jason Shiga's <em>Empire State</em> is another version of the "inaction comic." It's subtitle "A Love Story (Or Not)" gives on the one hand and takes away with parentheses on the other, freezing the story in indeterminacy. And there is something Corrigan-esque about this Jimmy; he can't make it with girls, and his mother is a pain in the neck. He's a tech geek (though perhaps not a particularly skilled one) who works at the library and fiddles with his website. Shiga draws Jimmy, and most of the rest of his characters, in a way that can only be described as "schlumpy." Their shoulders are round, and their heads big.  They do not possess the "pecs and pipes" of the superhero. Rather they look like they have just emerged from a cocoon and have not quite straightened out yet. They look burdened and unassertive. When Jimmy's friend Sara says, "I prefer someone passive and weak-willed who I can push around," it barely registers as ironic.</p>

<p>The arc of the story is that Sara, the love interest (or not), moves to New York. Lovelorn (or not), Jimmy decides to chase after her.</p>

<p>[picture: empire_state_pg26_02.jpg]</p>

<p>He writes her a letter that declares he wants to meet her on the observation floor of the Empire State Building on Presidents' Day, (Valentine's Day has already passed), sort of like <em>Sleepless in Seattle</em> , a gesture that he calls "simultaneously unoriginal and psychotic." Jimmy's gambit doesn't work. Before bidding Jimmy goodbye at the airport, Sara give him a hug, "just to get you through the next year or two." The hug links Jimmy to one of Sara's dates from the past, whom she met through a dating service. He was 400 pounds and had to use ski polls to keep his knees from buckling. Sara made out with him because "I just didn't want to treat him the same way every other woman does."</p>

<p>The failure of the journey to New York from Oakland undercuts the whole notion of heroic action and "epic" adventure. Not to mention any romantic comedy conventions that the allusion to <em>Sleepless in Seattle</em> gives rise to. The only "action" in <em>Empire State</em> is Jimmy hitting Sara in the eye with a slushball: "Splat!"</p>

<p>As with <em>Jimmy Corrigan</em>, the chief existential problem in <em>Empire State</em> is the central character's inability to achieve adulthood in the modern world: "I'm an adult. I should have a newspaper subscription. I should be smoking a pipe and attending the opera regularly." Jimmy imagines that growing up should be like Luke Skywalker's character growth in the <em>Star Wars</em> movies: "Like, do you remember how in the first two 'Star Wars' movies Luke is this bratty little kid. But then you see him in 'Jedi' and he's a total badass." The analogy is probably not the best one for someone seeking maturity because it is so associated with the childhood imagination. But it is also an analogy based on confidence gained through heroic exploits. What makes Luke a "badass" is action. Furthermore, that action is based on zen-like self-surrender, a "force" that Jimmy can have no access to because he is so self-preoccupied.</P>

<p>At times it seems as if graphic novels like <em>Empire State</em> and <em>Jimmy Corrigan, The Smartest Kid on Earth</em> are so intent on dismissing the possibility of super heroic transformation that they dismiss any possibility of transformation whatsoever: losers don't get bitten by spiders and become heroes; they just stay losers. When Grant Morrison was recently taken to task for criticizing Chris Ware for his negativity, I believe that this "inaction" is what he was getting at. So, we might say, welcome to the bi-polar world of comics: the mania of the superhero comic at one end and the melancholy of the inaction comic at the other. Neither pole has any greater claim to "realism" than the other. Total losers are just as unlikely as Superman.</p>

<p>The inaction of <em>Empire State</em> made me appreciate the	genius of Bryan Lee O'Malley's <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>. Scott is a character not entirely unlike Jimmy in <em>Empire State</em>; he's a bass player for goodness' sake. But he does play in the band. And he fights evil ex-boyfriends in spectacular battles to win Ramona. O'Malley presents a deft version of the "have your cake and eat it too" version of the loser/hero dichotomy of the super hero comic. In doing so he re-iterates the existentialist ethic of the super-hero comic: everyone must choose and act as if the world depended on it.</p>

<p>I loved <em>Empire State</em>. John Pham's colours are gorgeous when combined with Shiga's atmospheric images of Oakland and New York, and Shiga's arrangement of the panels on the page makes the reader appreciate the process of reading comics more than any text this side of Mazzucchelli's <em>Asterios Polyp</em>. But when I think about how critics tend to valorize inaction comics over action comics, I can't help but recall a comment that David Lee Roth once made, which goes something like this: "Most music critics prefer Elvis Costello to Van Halen because most music critics look like Elvis Costello."</p>
