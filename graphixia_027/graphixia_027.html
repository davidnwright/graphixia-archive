<p>Though there have been many Golden Age superheroes who have lasted into the present day with continually running serials (Superman, Captain America, and the entire Justice Society of America for example), few have had the staying power and continued cultural relevance as Batman. Why is this the case? Of all of the super heroes that have transitioned into other media 	and popular culture, Batman is, at least on the surface, the most simple: a child whose parents were murdered in front of his eyes dons a costume in order to exact vengeance on the “stupid and cowardly lot” who would seek to do the same to others. Unlike other popular characters, he has no fantastic power other than that of great wealth and training, and his sense of justice is, with the possible exception of Superman, the least nuanced of all the mainstream heroes – for Batman, there has consistently been a definitive line between right and wrong that needs to be upheld. At first glance, Batman has all the makings of an entirely archetypal hero, easily deciphered and dispensed with in order to move on to more elaborate fare.</p>

<p>This said, Batman is the most prolific character in comics, having had multiple series at any given moment along with countless one-shots, miniseries and crossovers over the decades. <em>Detective Comics</em>, of which Batman has been the main focus since his first appearance, is second only to <em>Action Comics</em> as superhero comics’ longest running title (as of this writing, it stands at issue #877), and his solo title has recently surpassed 700 issues itself.

<p>Batman currently has more ongoing titles than any other <em>DC</em> character, with new series being added annually. <em>Legends of the Dark Knight</em> ran for over 200 issues, and there have been other major titles starring the character, such as Shadow of the Bat, that have lasted several years on their own as well. Despite being a <em>DC</em> character, he has made guest appearances in Marvel titles as well as those of other smaller publishing houses, is the focus of many novels, movies and TV serials including live action and cartoons, and he is also the most widely discussed character in these early stages of mainstream comics transitioning into the academic arena. Despite his apparent simplicity then, Batman is a staple of comic fandom and has maintained relevance across generations as he nears his 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary.</p>

<p>Created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger in 1939, Batman came about largely as a response to the success of Siegel and Shuster’s Superman – the publisher was looking for new ways to capitalize on the public’s growing interest in costumed crimefighting and was eager to add new characters to its stable. He was not a new invention by any stretch of the imagination, the general concept, if not the details, having been born out of the detective serials of the 1930’s. While detective fiction abounded, however, the superhero was a relatively new invention for the era. That the rise of the costumed hero came about during the final stages of the Great Depression in America is hardly a surprise as well, as many scholars have noted: Unsure of the stability of the nation, the costumed hero who brought social justice where the government had so dramatically failed was needed escapism for a people desperate for order and equity, a fantasy of rationality and a good-versus-evil paradigm when so many were suffering under the apparent collapse of capitalism.</p>

<p>Appearing first in <em>Detective Comics</em> #27 (though we don’t see a hint of his origins until issue #33), the introduction of Batman marked a shift in the title – prior to his invention, <em>Detective</em> was a traditional gumshoe serial that introduced characters of little staying power (with Shuster and Siegel’s pre-Superman character Slam Bradley being the notable exception). At 64 pages per issue, early Detective was an anthology comic and offered multiple mystery and crime tales, with only a few stories being serialized beyond their individual issues. Bob Kane’s previous character for <em>Detective</em>, Oscar the Gumshoe, had seen moderate success with fans, but it was his idea for a “Bat-Man” (note the original hyphen) based on a composite of Douglas Fairbanks, Da Vinci sketches and Sherlock Holmes that caught his publisher’s interest. Bill Finger was assigned to assist with the character, and it was actually Finger who created the costume that has become so iconic –Kane’s original design was more a clone of Superman with red colouring, no cape and a mask instead of a cowl. Though Kane is normally credited with the creation of the character, Finger’s role in his development cannot be underestimated.</p>

<p>The Batman appearing in these earliest issues of <em>Detective</em> was quite different from what readers are now familiar with; despite the costume and secret identity, he was more of a traditional private dick, even carrying a gun. Criminals were killed without remorse by this Batman, and his nemeses were far less grandiose and fantastic than those we see in later issues of <em>Detective</em> and his solo title, with Batman foiling normal heists, mob bosses and the occasional mad scientist. In order to access a younger demographic, however, <em>DC</em> (then <em>National Publications</em>) requested that Batman have a child sidekick. Kane had originally envisioned a super-powered youth, but it was one of his assistants, Jerry Robinson, who was instrumental in conceiving of the original Robin who, like Batman, had no fantastic powers to create an entry point of identification for younger readers. From Robin’s introduction in <em>Detective Comics</em> #38 on, the series took on a more youthful tone, and in the Silver Age Batman began to battle more fantastic creatures such as space aliens and time-traveling cavemen in order to capture the younger demographic. The earlier issues were still mysteries, however, and the book remained an anthology title with other stories with various characters running alongside a regular Batman feature for several years. </p>

<p>The question remains: why has Batman survived for so long, visioned and revisioned by countless authors and artists over the decades while all pointing back to a platonic Batman as established by Kane and Finger’s original concept? It could be, perhaps, a relation of our original desire to see justice served, and a knowledge that our own, governmentally mandated law and order allows for inequities on an almost comical magnitude – it was this concept that served as the impetus for Batman and other superheroes, after all. It could also be the stark vision of legality that we see in Batman’s understanding of good and evil, simplifying for the reader a complex dynamic of conflicting moralities in order to bring some stability to our own, often overwhelmed perspectives on the social world – the truth for a detective is definitive, and in these stories one just needs to be able to decipher the clues in the correct way in order to rationalize the overly problematic. Bruce Wayne is also a member of the American elite, and there is certainly a precedent for interest in celebrity culture and a desire to see these cultural icons as something more than human. These points, though certainly being elements of his success, could be made of all detective fiction, from Sherlock Holmes to Dick Tracy to the Green Hornet, and there is clearly something more to Batman’s specific character that makes him survive and remain relevant.</p>

<p>Batman succeeds, more likely, because of the innovative blend between heroism and the everyday – his powers are the result of exhaustive training and a vast fortune inherited from his parents, making him accessible to the readership in a way that nearly all other superheroes are not. His origin, boiled down, is the platonic revenge tale that one sees in Shakespearian or Greek tragedy, and in this Batman is a blank canvas on which authors have been able to expand and expound on the core facets of his character over many years. He struggles to discover his true identity while driven by fanatical vengeance, and at times we are unsure of which character, Wayne or Batman, is really the mask. Despite the division, he exists in a world of certitudes and strength of character, showing us that order may come from chaos given enough perseverance and the right motivation at our backs, and these attributes involve us in his stories while prompting us to recognize and reconcile the moral inequities that we notice in our own lives. While beginning as a simple vigilante with what could be considered a basic origin, Batman has been chiseled into a character as complex as the sum of the authors who have tried their hands at relating his saga – the posts in the coming weeks will be exploring some of these revisions, extensions and reworkings of continuity.</p>
