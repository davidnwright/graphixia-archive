<em><p>This post was delayed on account of cat injury / illness.  It was almost a detailed play-by-play of administering anti-inflammatories to an angry cat, but that post will eventually be a graphic narrative all its own: Tales of a Broken Tail.  But cats -- the internet's favourite animal -- give a prime segue into the internet's other favourite thing: Scott Pilgrim.</em></p>

<em><p>Yes, that's right -- a blog post, on the internet, about Scott Pilgrim.  And it's not even 2009!  Amazing.</p></em>

<p>When I first moved to Vancouver, I had an experience at a comic book shop that chilled me to the core.  I asked the head nerd if he could recommend me some Canadian titles to check out -- slice of life or otherwise, I wasn't picky; just looking for some new CanCon because I like graphic narratives and I teach Canadian literature and I like to teach graphic narratives in my Canadian literature classes.</p>
			
<blockquote>Me: What can you recommend in terms of recent Canadian graphic narratives?

Head Nerd: There aren't any.

Me: *stunned silence*

Head Nerd: Yeah, Canadians just don't write graphic stuff.

Me: *quiet aneurysm*

Head Nerd: I guess maybe Scott Pilgrim.  But that barely counts. Bryan Lee O'Malley doesn't even live in Canada anymore.</blockquote>

<p>When I regained consciousness, I set about finding a different comic shop to frequent.  But it foregrounded a couple of issues for me: <ol> <li>Are Canadian comic readers unaware of Canadian cultural output in this realm?</li> <li>What makes something Canadian?</li> </ol> I won't try to cover #2, since a PhD in CanLit and countless essays from students has not yet illuminated this for me.  I'll touch on some aspects, though. #1, however, makes me wonder.  I was pleased when <em>Essex County</em> was selected for Canada Reads last year, because I think Canada Reads usually does a good job of demonstrating what middlebrow literature consumers are in to, and it was nice to see graphic narrative represented there for the first time (even if the debates around it were troubling).  But what is the awareness of Canadian graphic novels and narratives generally?  Will a Sarah Leavitt ever have the cultural cache of a Miriam Toewes? Does it matter?  Do people know that <em>Kill Shakespeare</em> is Canadian when they pick it up?  Do they care?</p>

<p>Because CanLit is my thing, I try to use my non-themed posts	here at Graphixia to talk about Canadian titles -- it hasn't been conscious, really, up to now, but it will be from here on out. And I'm going to start with the first of a series of posts about Scott Pilgrim, because I think in interesting ways Bryan Lee O'Malley is actually very interested in carving out specifically Canadian space in the world of graphic narratives. And also because the series is freaking awesome -- which the internet could already tell you, of course.</p>

<p>Volume One of the Scott Pilgrim saga, <em>Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life</em> sets up the basic premise of the series: Scott Pilgrim is a slacker who plays in a crappy band and mooches off his best friend and dates high school girls and just generally kind of herp derps his way through life.  Until he meets Ramona Flowers, who magic-pixie-dream-girls his heart. But she's going to make him work for it -- she has seven evil exes, and to be her boyfriend, Scott Pilgrim will have to defeat them all.</p>

<p>If you saw the movie trailer, you know the plot.</p>

<p>But the graphic novel also sets up a very specifically Canadian space for the narrative to unfold.  This is not a Canadian city posing as Anycity, USA -- this is Toronto, complete with accurate street and place references (Tourism Toronto even wants you to <a	href="http://www.seetorontonow.com/scottpilgrim/index.asp">take the Scott Pilgrim tour of the city</a>).  In a class on the text, I had students catalogue all the minute Canadian details -- from use of "eh" to images of Canadian currency to brands like Molson and Labatts -- and respond to it.  Many students liked that something so full of Canadian in-jokes and reference points was so popular outside of Canada; that indeed Bryan Lee O'Malley's international success suggested a legitimacy for these cultural reference points that they particularly appreciated.</p>

<p>(The eternal need for such legitimacy is Canadian in and of itself, of course.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2010.07-film-saneman/"> Critics have argued that Scott Pilgrim's underdog-done-good narrative is a particularly Canadian rendition of the superhero saga</a>, and I like that reading but I'm not sure it holds up -- the formula of slacker-turned-hero is not a Canadian invention nor particularly special Canadian terrain.  But that it is read this way is important to an understanding of how Canadians perceive ourselves, and why we like these moments of "American noticed us!"</p>

<p>I think the more important contribution of a text like <em>Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life</em> -- particularly given its international success and popularity -- is that it uses Canadian space-and-place as significantly interesting haunts for superhero stories.  It does so with great self-awareness (the frame-by-frame packing in of Canadian reference points suggests this) and a sense of purpose.  O'Malley is telling an entertaining story first and foremost, but his desire to locate and frame it within a Canadian (and specifically Torontonian) series of cultural reference points is important to developing and nurturing a larger conversation about Canadian graphic narratives more generally.</p>

<p>Next month, I'll talk more about the story itself, with a particular eye to the way gender is represented in the Scott Pilgrim saga.</p>
