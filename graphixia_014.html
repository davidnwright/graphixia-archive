<p>One of the most common themes in graphic narratives is the apocalypse. Usually associated with some sort of impending doom, narratives that deal with an impending apocalypse, or narratives that create an apocalyptic possibility, frequent our literature. Nearly always, the central characters in Western fiction, particularly modern English literature, are facing some kind of apocalyptic event that drives their narrative. How these characters deal with the apocalyptic threat--or it metaphoric equivalent--is one of the most central story-lines in modern literature.</p>

<p>Despite its entrenchment in the prophecies of doom, the apocalyptic moment can signal a rebirth or renewal; it's not all bad. Often, the apocalyptic moment sets off the narrative, creating the environment for character and story to develop. Asterios Polyp's apartment burning down sets the story-line in motion and creates the context for the graphic novel. In a wonderful twist to the apocalyptic theme, the fiery decent of arenegade earth-destroying asteroid suggests Asterios' new-found emotional clarity set in motion by the novel's first house-burning apocalypse will end with the novel's final, real, apocalypse. Likewise, Superman's residency on earth as a moral crusader against petty criminals and dimensional time-travelers is set in motion by the apocalyptic fate of Krypton. Suffice to say, not all apocalyptic moments or threats necessarily mean the end; they can also signal enlightenment, fortitude and renewal.</p>

<p>Frank Kermode, in his book <em>The Sense of an Ending: Studies in the Theory of Fiction</em>, argues that modern literature's obsession with apocalyptic themes that are both positive and negative has led to the deployment of a type of character who is always what Kermode calls "in the middest." Characters are stuck in a kind of limbo where they fail to develop or, fail to act in a way that represents some kind of moral lesson or guidance. In short, the characters do not develop, but rather represent the painstaking minutiae that are the moments between an apocalypse that represents rebirth--the promise of emotional, physical, and intellectual enlightenment--and the apocalypse that represents the end--the promise of an end to emotional, physical, and intellectual pain.</p>

<p>Here’s what Kermode writes to help explain his concept of the apocalypse in modern literature: "Men, like poets, rush 'into the middest,' <em>in medias res</em>, when they are born; they also	die <em>in medias rebus</em>, and to make sense of their span they need fictive concords with origins and ends, such as give meaning to lives and to poems. The End they imagine will reflect their irreducibly intermediary preoccupations. They fear it, and as far as we can see have always done so; the End is a figure for their own deaths" (Kermode 7).  What Kermode’s getting at here is that we rely on our sense of what we are doing in life to understand what our deaths will be like. In other words, we might die working, or skiing, but not because we were zapped by an Alien's death-ray, no matter how cool that might be. We also, argues Kermode, tend to construct our origins and endings--make-up what makes us up and fantasize about how it will end. Given this set of interpretive and creative circumstances, Kermode concludes that "Ideally, it [life, narrative, character] is a wholly concordant structure, the end is in harmony with the beginning, the middle with the beginning and end" (Kermode 6). In short, we always interpret things--from comic books to our lives--as having a concordant and complete structure; the wrath from the sky that begins <em>Asterios Polyp</em> reappears at the end of the novel providing a nice continuity to the events of the story and the journey Asterios undertakes.</p>

<p>Being stuck in the middle is a peculiar condition of modern life and it is nowhere represented better than in the characters who appear in graphic narratives. The vast majority of the characters in graphic narratives--Jimmy Corrigan, Vladek, Asterios, Bruce Bechdel, even Superman and Batman--are in the process of reconstructing a past or envisioning a more promising future. These quests for understanding and identity often guide	the process through which the story develops and, in the case of the images, the kind of concordance the images can provide.</p>

<p>In spite of its tendencies toward innovative story-lines and cutting-edge subjects, the graphic narrative relies on the kind of “fictive concords” Kermode identifies. On the one hand, a comic book like<em> Batman</em> always begins in medias res, taking up a narrative long begun and reconstructing origins as it goes along. On the other hand, a more serious graphic narrative such as <em>Maus</em>, also enters into a long-standing narrative surrounding memory, memoir, and history. In both cases, an apocalyptic moment launches or sustains the narrative. At the same time, the imagery--Batman always looks like Batman / Vladek is always on his "stationary" bike--gives the narrative a “concordant structure” that anchors the process toward enlightenment, or the continuing futility of coming to terms with the emotional scars that govern our identity and actions.</p>

<p>In <em>The Incredibles</em>, Edna's warning that there are to be “no capes!” relies on the threat of a “cape apocalypse” for its resonance. However, that same apocalyptic threat also brings about a rebirth and breath of originality in her suit design. The apocalypse both constructs the beginning--the capes that were--and opens the door for the future--the capes that are no more. The stories about the capes--and the images of them—provide continuity in an often seemingly discontinuous medium.</p>
