<p>Not to play devil’s advocate to our last poster, but Batman has always been the superhero with whom I’ve identified and connected with the most out of the plethora of those characters who exist in both DC and Marvel comics – this could be because he appears the most realistic, with powers that are based predominantly on excessive training and technologies which, albeit specious, don’t disrupt my reality too greatly (and great wealth has always been a more realistic fantasy for me than the ability to fly). More likely, however, it’s because Batman was the first superhero I’d ever read about, having picked up a tattered copy of Miller’s collected <em>Dark Knight Returns</em> in my local library at eight years old, reading it in a single sitting and held rapt by the stark, gritty nature of the character and the dialogue. Though I’ve since learned to approach the text from a more academic standpoint, I don’t think I will ever feel as drawn to Batman – or the superhero genre on the whole – as I did during that first encounter with a world in which justice could be brought to chaos given enough willpower, determination, fanaticism and a sense of responsibility to effect change where one finds often overwhelming inequities. I felt that I understood Batman’s origin and his motivations fully from this single story, allowing me complete and definitive access to Batman as a character.</p>

<p>This said, what I first encountered in <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em> was not actually Batman at all – Batman had thrived in DC comics for nearly fifty years prior to Miller’s revisioning of the character at the end of his career, embittered but emboldened by the unswerving social decline of Gotham’s streets	and youth. <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>, a miniseries that, along with the release of <em>Watchmen</em>, prompted DC to fill its UPC  boxes on the direct market editions of its entire line of titles with: “DC Comics: they’re not just for kids anymore,” was the first step in a dramatic undertaking by the publisher to remove heroes from their original contexts and provide them with familiar supporting characters and situations while approaching them in a way that was different, sometimes dramatically, from the worlds which the readers knew and had expectations for regarding continuity. Marvel had been attempting this several years prior with its line of <em>What If…?</em> - currently at issue #200 - in which key events in the Marvel Universe are explored from the perspective of hypothetical, alternate outcomes (such as “What if Wolverine had killed the Hulk?” reworking the events of Wolverine’s first appearance in <em>Incredible Hulk #181</em>). The advent of <em>What If…?</em> is significant in that it showcases the importance of continuity for comics’ readership, a point on which I’ve posted before – there would be no interest or upset if the details of characters’ origins and running histories had not already been so engrained in readers’ minds, a constant of how they approach each subsequent issue throughout the Universe’s line of titles. My personal situation was oddly reversed, however; I encountered the revision and had to later piece together the original, scouring for and collecting the texts that defined the character that Miller, in his adaptation, redefined so well.</p>

<p>When DC attempted its own first, tenuous version of What If…? in the</p>

<p>form of <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>, the response was significant and has since become, some argue, the entry point for Batman into the academy. Instead of offering a single title devoted to revising key events, DC released one-shots, most frequently presented in squarebound, relatively expensive prestige format issues written and drawn by comicdom’s most important writers of the day. Batman, being arguably DC’s flagship character, was at the core of this new approach - <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em> had gained so much critical acclaim that it only made sense to continue using this character for its continuity bending initiatives. The first of these was <em>Gotham by Gaslight</em>, which incorporated a Victorian styled, steampunk Batman into the mythology of Jack the Ripper, as Batman pursues a copycat killer in Gotham and, of course, eventually brings him to justice. Written and drawn by Mike Mignola and Brian Augustyn, <em>Gaslight</em> has been reprinted multiple times and now thrives as a hardcover edition, appended by the author’s notes and storyboards and its sequel, <em>Batman: Master of the Future</em>. It is one of the texts, alongside <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>, <em>Arkham Asylum</em> and <em>The Killing Joke</em>, most frequently taught in academic courses featuring Batman, and it has implications that redefined the genre of superhero storytelling.</p>

<p>successes prompted the imprint, still running to this day, of DC’s <em>Elseworlds</em>. Each of these titles showcased the <em>Elseworlds</em> logo and read, on the back cover, "In <em>Elseworlds</em>, heroes are taken from their usual settings and put into strange times and places — some that have existed, and others that can't, couldn't or shouldn't exist. The result is stories that make characters who are as familiar as yesterday seem as fresh as tomorrow." In these titles, authors were free to move outside the rigid bounds of continuity and rework characters entirely as they saw fit. Batman is the central figure in the majority of <em>Elseworld</em> titles, with notable examples being <em>Holy Terror</em>, which supposes a theocratic America	based on the religious beliefs of Oliver Cromwell, and the more recent, Eisner Award winning <em>Batman: Year One Hundred</em>, a <em>Dark Knight Returns</em>-styled portrayal of a future Batman, beset by similar governmental and social ills. Currently numbering at close to fifty different titles featuring Batman (though there are many more concentrating on other DC characters), these <em>Elseworlds</em> stories often draw from the rich backgrounds of the authors who crafted them, placing Batman anywhere from the French Revolution to the distant future. Most importantly, however, these titles always sketch out a new origin for the character, a reboot through which readers can access the familiar yet different and an entirely self contained story.</p>

<p>The existence and success of <em>Elseworlds</em> titles highlights two important functions (other than the telling of normally fascinating and inspired stories) in the comics’ greater universe. Firstly, these tales offer an avenue for new readers to become familiar with a canon that can often be so complex that it denies the casual reader any sense of familiarity or identification. Working within the contained universe of the <em>Elseworlds</em> story, the reader, becoming comfortable, can then work backwards (as I did) to rediscover the original, being the template on which the revision was based<sup>1</sup>. The establishing of this avenue is significant, as the decades rich, ostracizing nature of comics’ universes requires these frequent fissures in order to gain readers and continue to publish – besides <em>Elseworlds</em> and <em>What If…?</em>, we see this in Marvel’s <em>Ultimate</em> line and DC’s (albeit short lived) recent <em>All Star</em> line. Secondly, these exceptions are what ultimately help to define the canon on the whole. Canon, in literature as well as in superhero comics, is solidified by what is outside of it; recalling (though reductively) one of the key features of semiotics, we understand best what something is by determining what it is not. Similarly, DC’s attempt to make characters “seem as fresh as tomorrow” actually has the markedly opposite effect, further engraining who and what a character is by putting pressure on him from the outside, highlighting what <em>he</em> is not. The fracturing of continuity through a prism of varied hypothetical circumstances paradoxically serves to make the fictional reality of the narrative that much more grounded.</p>

<p>The <em>Elseworlds</em> Batman stories are arguably the most entertaining for those who find them an affront to the reality that they have come to accept for the character (the recent complexity of which was very nicely summarized in last week’s post). While offering access to new readers, they also serve the opposite function of justifying the close reading of long-time followers of the hero, those who are intimately familiar with the minutiae of plot and character development over the years. My personal experience with the character is a case in point – I began on the fringes of the DCU and was compelled by the fact that I had mapped out a contained universe in one volume. Entering the title(s) on the whole, I found a far richer, more complex environment that similarly housed a definite world, with characters that could be mapped and traced onto an often byzantine canon that, while sometimes fantastic and carrying the quirks of any multi-authored work, was also stable and just as defined as any other single text.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup><sup></sup> We can see this in recent literature as well, with sales figures showing a rise in Austen texts after the publication of the interesting revisions <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> and <em>Sense and Sensibility and <em>Sea Monsters</em>.</p>
