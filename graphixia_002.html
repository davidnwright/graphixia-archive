<p>The interplay between costume, metonymy, and identity might best be described as a "paradox of identity." The phrase tries to capture the fluidity that marks identity in graphic narratives.</p>

<p>Most important in identifying the paradoxical nature of the character's identity are the costume, the objects he comes in contact with, and often the emotional or physical crisis that leads the character into the paradoxical--or split--identity in the first place. When the reader comes in contact with the paradoxical representations of identity-often subversive and latent / secret and visible-s/he is forced into an ambiguous interpretive space where s/he cannot quite arrive at a stable understanding of the characterâ€™s "true" identity.</p>

<p>With Superman, the reader's paradoxical interpretation is most evident in Clark Kent. Clark is Superman's secret identity. Unlike other costumed superheroes, Superman is the "real" person and Clark Kent is the costumed, disguised "hero." The reader then sympathizes with Clark Kent--the Everyman hero--but longs to be the real person--morally upstanding, strong, attractive--that is Superman. Whereas a superhero such as Batman conceals his true identity-the everyday individual-and puts forward another identity to the world--The Batman--Superman conceals his otherworldliness by costuming himself as the mild-mannered, common man.</p>

<p>The interplay between concealment and exposition in the superhero's identity suggest that the text and image negotiate a subversive or latent space for interpretation as well. At times, the text spells out the action in the images. At other times, the text encourages the reader to interpret the images in a specific way, or context. The art and text participate in a kind of dance where each will conceal and display--at the same time, as opposing forces, or as collaboration. This interplay between text and image suggests that the text and image are participating in a similar negotiation between concealment and exposition as the reader is when interpreting the paradoxes of identity contained within the character. What emerges then is a nascent pattern inherent in both superhero and "serious" graphic narratives; that the structure or apparatus for story-telling inherently solicits paradoxical interpretations from the reader who cannot avoid consistent bouts of re-interpretation and going-back-over to stabilize the myriad structures of representation.</p>

<p>The interpretive exercises the reader undertakes in reading a graphic narrative are paradoxical in nature because they rely on the reader'ss fluid movement  between concealment and exposition / text and image. The narrative structure then is a metonym for the paradoxical identity of the characters: Jimmy Corrigan is both Superman and Everyman, both drawn and imagined; Superman is both super and ordinary; Bruce Bechdel is both homosexual and heterosexual.</p>
