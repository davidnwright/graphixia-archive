<p>The discord between the superhero's secret and actual identity plays havoc with the metaphorical dimension of identity, where an individual can substitute "I" for a function or a name: I am a fireman; I am Bruce Wayne.</p>

<p>The concept of the "alter ego" makes identity fundamentally ironic, like the picture of the rabbit/duck that could be either thing, depending on which way you look at it.</p>

<p>Moreover, this bifurcation or alternation of identity carries the additional irony of actually grounding identity by stopping it from floating away in ghostly metonymies. In other words, the either/or of the alter ego prevents both amorphousness of identity and a never ending list of possible identities.</p>

<p><em>Fun Home</em> dwells on the way Alison and her father invoke the metonymies of gender identity. Bruce has his obsession with decoration, design, flowers and so forth, while Alison has	her "masculine" clothes and the nickname "Butch." However, Bruce's "gay" metonymies compete with those of the heterosexual family man living in a small town.</p>

<p>His inability to substitute "I" with "gay" means that he represses the "symptoms" of his homosexual identity, or tucks them away in secret corners. By hiding something away, Bruce actually gives himself substance. He is something "other" than he appears-just like Peter Parker or Bruce Wayne-and this otherness prevents him from disappearing into the banality of failed family man. As far as Alison is concerned, Bruce has to be reconstructed as his alter ego. The rehabilitation of the father is a necessary element of Alison's origin story, which develops to the point where she is able to make the metaphorical gesture--"I am a Lesbian"--line up perfectly with the metonymies that go with it. It is as if Alison were able to declare herself Batman and never take off the costume, the tool belt and so forth. By telling the story of her father as closeted gay man, Alison attempts to perform the same gesture for her father. The gesture is figuratively successful, as Bruce comes to "represent" the small-town homosexual of the 1970s. A detour through Daniel Clowe's <em>Ghost World</em> helps to illustrate the power of Alison Bechdel's metaphorical identity. Enid Coleslaw in <em>Ghost World</em> offers an example of identity that is al metonymy and no metaphor. She is unable to solve for the X of identity, so she compensates by having a series of "looks"--punk rocker, 1930s woman-one thing after another. Enid is like a superhero who cannot settle on a particular costume or alter ego. Her greatest desire is to find one look and stick with it, but that appears to be impossible.  When Enid purchases what looks like a Batman or Catwoman mask at Adam's II sex shop, her mocking of the superhero’s fetishistic costume also mocks her own inability to fill the mask, to be something under it.</p>

<p>Consequently, Enid dissolves. At one point, her best friend Becky says that Enid is getting blurry, difficult to see. The ghosts of <em>Ghost World</em> are the looks that Enid produces, representing her inability to anchor her identity.</p>

<p>Alison's discovery of her sexual identity in <em>Fun Home</em> shows why identity politics are so powerful: they give the appearances and associations that go with an identification substance because they are ostensibly rooted, no longer free floating ghosts. They anchor metonymies in a powerful metaphor.</p>
