<p>As the catchy title suggests, this post is about women and comic books. It’s also about exclusion and inclusion. Comic book fans like to talk about how "inclusive" and "collaboratory" the medium is; a rich melange of artists, writers, colourists, and inkers: story-tellers all. Comic book readers are well informed, well read, and well aware of most intricacies a critic might examine. There’s no doubt that the community around comic books is an enlightened and contemplative group, exemplified by their devotion to the medium and the craft of creating it. But…</p>

<p>Conversations about comic book characters tend to centre on discussions of exclusion—how Peter Parker is a nerdy kid who we all identify with, who doesn't "belong." How any one of us could be Superman if we could just shed our Clark Kent cookie-cutter goodie work-a-day suits and take to the radical, rarefied air of physical dominance unconscious of how others perceive us. We’re all super in disguise. We all want to belong, but we’re part of a marginalized sub-set who read comic books in bed, with a flashlight, alone. We know there are others like us and we seek them out and, in the end, we "belong": "Comic Book Nerds" all.</p>

<p>However, anyone who has had the misfortune of walking into a comic book store knows, the community that says it is all about sharing, can be all about exclusion too. In fact, being a comic book fan is often an egotistical gambit that highlights esoteric knowledge and obscene collections. There isn’t another place on earth other than perhaps inside the IT department of your most recent employer that attacks the ignorant, but eager, more than the collected masses of the comic book store. For all its representations of the marginalized geek, the comic book encourages the same pack-rat behaviours the comic fan deplores in the jocks and “normals” who persecute them in everyday life. Comic books don't encourage acceptance, they encourage exclusion and exclusivity—the very same things that self-described comic book nerds often say led them to comic book stories (and stores) in the first place. And, the clearest example of this exclusionary tendency is nowhere more evident than in comic book representations of women.</p>

<p>Often approached through an analysis of comic book readership, which is predominantly male, the representation of women in comic books prioritizes a particular type of form and substance. Furthermore, the comic book fan rarely—though they would argue stringently the opposite—accepts a divergent storyline, so committed are they to the cyclical narratives and stories of the genre (how many times have we heard about Batman’s origins?). For all its talk of marginalized representation, the superhero comic book tends to represent adolescent (or “mature adolescent”) characters who are white, middle or upper class, and marginalized not by race, creed, religion, sex, or sexual orientation, but because of their adroit intelligence or lack of social skills; and we see this fundamental architecture over and over again even though the stories and characters might change. Even when other marginalized figures—those marginalized by race, creed, etc.—are present, they tend to embody the stereotypes that white, middle or upper class, social misfits most fear.</p>

<p>If we concentrate on female representations in comic books, for now, we must ask two questions: 1) where are the women? And 2) where are the “ordinary” women. There are lots of extraordinary women; extraordinarily beautiful, dangerous, perceptive, and invisible. That last one is the giveaway. Not only are females (and I am using that term on purpose here, to belabor the point) under-represented, but they are also, in the grand tradition, usually sculpted from a dominant, authentic, primary (you pick) “male” version. Female superheroes with similar names to their male counterparts abound: Ms. Marvel, Marvel Girl, Supergirl/Woman, Batgirl/Woman, Spider-Woman. Even somewhat original names are eclipsed by their semantic closeness: “Wonder” Woman, “Cat” Woman, “Panther” Girl, all of which suggest associations to Batman or Superman or the "Boy" Wonder. Even names like “Storm” and “Rogue” suggest the climatic conditions of the pre-menstrual cycle, or the cringe-worthy clicking wink of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mama_grizzly">Mama-Grizzly-shootin' Sarah Palin</a>. </p>

<p>A website such as “<a href="http://www.unheardtaunts.com/wir/">Women in Refrigerators</a>” is well worth a look for <a href="http://www.unheardtaunts.com/wir/women.html">examples</a> of the way female disfigurement and disempowerment jump start story lines for male superheroes. Even a quick review of the superpowers possessed by female superheroes reveals a mail sack of patriarchal cliches and masculine insecurities surrounding the powers of the “other,” or “opposite” sex. Invisibility (Sue Storm, Fantastic Four) is particularly appropriate given the marginalized position of women historically, as is Jean Grey’s power to read the mind (Emma Frost also comes to mind) and Wonder Woman’s ability to force her foes into telling the truth is a big concern for any philandering (or golf playing while supposed to be working) Alpha Male. One prolonged touch from “Rogue” leaves  a man hovering near death!</p>

<p>And then there’s the costumes. An obvious point of attack which the pictures in the this post have been driving home as you’ve been reading. One look at Power Girl’s enormous breasts would render most, male or female, gay or straight, stunned. What Kryptonite could possibly foil those breasts!? Sure, some will quickly say that the costumes reflect a “male” readership and a “male” authorship; whatever, admit it, the costumes of most female superheroes reflect stereotypes and representations of the worst kind. Would we accept a Black Superhero who used Ebonics or Crack Cocaine to disable his foes and had a costume that barely contained his enormous, engorged, smooth, penis (just imagine seeing almost all of that penis, but its throbbing head)? According to the evidence in this post, sure we would accept it!</p>

<p>Female superheroes are almost always cousins or sisters or kin of some male superhero. Rarely are they generative, rarely do they deal with the contexts so prevalent in male superheroes: marginalization, social insecurity, sexual inadequacies, a need to perform the moral right. All this leaves a lingering issue for comic book fans, one they might not want to admit they have: they’re exclusionary. Both the creators—by representing like they do—and the fans—for accepting and condoning marginalized representations like they do—are putting forward a particular kind of representation whose primary characteristics are exactly those they so deplore and which caused them to withdraw. Comics are hardly open and collaborative; they verge on the offensive in a way that Peter Parker could never conceive (boy, I bet he has a small penis).</p>

<p>In closing, one of the dominant post-superhero modes for comics is undoubtedly the memoir, a narrative form that, for women, seems to come to the fore in response to the male lead of comics authors such as Art Spiegelman, Chris Ware, and Will Eisner, all of whom come at the non-superhero comic through memoir. One example of the parallel currents in subject matter or its mode of presentation is Alison Bechdel’s <em>Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic</em> in which Bechdel revisits her father’s “lost” history, a narrative perspective used by Spiegelman to great acclaim in <em>Maus</em>. We can only hope that this similar mode—right down to dealing with “fathers” is the beginning of a more symbiotic relationship between women and comics books; one in which they have their own voices and representations beside their male counterparts (or collaborators). However, it does seem as though female writers desperately need to find a voice that screams outside the shadows of male-dominated forms and formats for the comic and character that truly reflect a female voice (whatever might distinguish it) in order to for comics to have any established legitimacy as a primary medium for creative expression in the twenty first century.</p>
