<p>Comic book art has less to do with verisimilitude, perhaps, than caricature.  The artist has a "way" of drawing a particular character that ensures consistency from frame to frame. This consistency establishes an iterability that collapses or reduces the "face" of a character to tics, lines, a limited number of expressions.</p>

<p>With serialized comics, such  as superhero comics, it is a shock when a different artist draws the series. It is both exciting and discombobulating. We see a new way of presenting the character, but also a disturbing deviation from the past. Things do not seem correct. We can look at the historical development of Batman, for instance, passing through the hands of various artists, growing stockier then more elongated, and feel a kind of disorientation.</p>

<p>Alison Bechdel encodes this disorientation in Fun Home by presenting Bruce Bechdel in two visual modes: cartoon and simulated photograph. Like any comic artist, Bechdel has a "way" of drawing Bruce. Here is an example: <img class="center"src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Fba7JgYVt43iBiSWaiiGau36VK4pffhyEFOdeLQ2CuULecjYNa3IyK3WGQBqjeAiFb_19 T_XK uVpg 9cHVb0-i-pBITJMA8FfVEy3NShxiXeg3o9hfg" alt="width"="250px;" height="238px;"/></p>

<p>This simple, iterable cartoon Bruce contrasts with Bruce in the "photograph":</p>

<p>As we can see, Bruce looks distinctly different in the "photograph" than he does in the generic frames of the text, replaying the identity duality in the text. Once we have seen the "photograph," which is the first image that we see in the text, it is difficult to view the cartoon image as anything but a mask or screen. We say to ourselves, "that's  not him at all." The cartoon picture is a mere place holder for the  genuine image. While the cartoon image of Bruce is up front, all there, without shadow or darkness, the simulated photograph is haunting, immediately suggestive of darkness and secrecy. The shadow on the left side of his face gives him something of a "Two Face" quality, making the  cartoon image appear to be missing a dimension. The image challenges us in a way that the cartoon never does. It is truly spooky.</p>

<p>A comparison of the simulated photograph and the actual photograph that Bechdel based her drawing on amplifies this spookiness. We can see a kinship between the drawing and the photograph right down to the shadow on the left side of the face. "That's him," we might be inclined to say.</p>

<p>The simulated photograph plays verisimilitude against caricature to tease us with the possibility of getting at the "real" Bruce, when in fact all that we get is a chain of images.

<p>Curiously,Â the question of identity in the superhero comic is played out in the realm of caricature. Of course there is no "actual" Bruce Wayne or Peter Parker behind the image. But Fun Home uses the cartoon image as a way of addressing this absence in a memoir that addresses real events. In a way, there is no one behind Bechdel's images, either, and that's the tragic dimension of this "family tragicomic." Behind the cartoon lies the simulated photograph, behind the simulated photograph lies the "real" photograph, but the chain stops there.</p>
