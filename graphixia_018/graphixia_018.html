<p>My colleagues have dealt effectively with some of the essential issues in Chester Brown's <em>Louis Riel: A Comic Strip Biography</em>*.  In tackling the ideas of super heroism, bilingualism, cultural erasure, mortality, sainthood, mysticism, irony, and framing, they've given two succinct yet complex examinations of what makes Louis Riel such a worthwhile read.  For my part, I'd like to focus primarily on a close reading of the text's epilogue: a single, five-panel page that picks up the narrative after the death of Riel.</p>

<p>In the podcast, I somewhat flippantly framed this conclusion as an example of “Everything Was Terrible, and Then They Died,” which is the unofficial theme of every Canadian Literature course I’ve ever taught.  But it is desperately true in this text. Not only, as the previous blog posts address, does our superhero die (the nerve!), but his legacy is left, at the end of this narrative, completely frustrated.</p>

<p>In the final five panels, we are told that 24 men who fought with the Métis were jailed and that many more fled to the States until an amnesty was declared; that Gabriel Dumont’s wife died and that he joined the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show; that Riel’s wife lost an infant child, then died herself, and then Riel’s other two children died, too; that Sir John A. MacDonald lived to a healthy old age and was Prime Minister forever; and that George Stephen, president of the CPR, became one of the richest men in the world and lived to be 92. </p>

<p>In other words: Métis jailed, exiled, dead; Riel line obliterated; MacDonald won; and Stephen won even more. Everything was terrible, and then they did really die.  Except the bad guys, who made out awesome.</p>

<p>Why this epilogue, though?</p>

<p>Because it's not just about representation of truth or history, as this isn’t where Riel’s story or the Riel-inspired Métis story ends.  A cheerier epilogue, <a href="http://www.learnmichif.com/home">one involving the Métis cultural renaissance and Riel’s role in it as a folk hero</a>, is possible here.  But Brown instead makes a choice to tell a very pessimistic version of Riel’s legacy in this epilogue, effectively destroying it.  There is no glimmer of hope and no opening for a sequel.  The camera does not pan to a baby Riel, swaddled in a basket, offering the promise of future rebellions to come.  Riel fails as a superhero in this narrative not just because he dies, but because he resists resurrection.  In the end, he’s just a man -- a dead one.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this epilogue underscores Brown’s ambivalence about Riel. Riel gets deconstructed, over the course of the narrative, from heroic figure (albeit reluctant) to ambiguously crazy (should we discount him or not?) to just broken. A different story about Riel would have ended differently, with a more uplifting and hopeful epilogue.  But this is, I think, at its core a story about tipping points and breaking points.  Brown is not just exploring Riel-the-character or Canadian identity (though he does do both very well); he’s also examining motivation and destruction.  What does it take for Riel to get involved, even when he really doesn’t seem to want to?  And what moves Riel from defending his culture and faith to rising up against the church he swore to protect?  The outspoken man from the beginning of the narrative is so easily and readily silenced at the end -- both literally and immediately, by his priest, and for all of history, by death, time, and Brown’s chosen focus. How he moves through this journey is at the heart of Brown’s exploration.</p>

<p>*: This FOOTNOTE is a place to observe that the other place I have seen this terminology is <em>Ice Haven</em> by Daniel Clowes, which he also terms a “comic-strip novel.”  This is an observation largely apropos of nothing, but I am nerdily interested in the naming of graphic narratives.  Is it okay to say comic book?  What if it’s not a novel, but it is graphic? /nerdalert</p>
