<p>In 1922, Gilbert Seldes proclaimed<em> <a href="http://www.comicstriplibrary.org/">Krazy Kat</a></em> “the most amusing and fantastic and satisfactory work of art produced in America today” (<em>The Seven Lively Arts</em> 22). Herriman’s <em>Krazy Kat</em>, a comic strip that ran from 1913 to 1944, took its aesthetic cues from Surrealism, Cubism, and Dadaism, and is distinctive for distorted and shifting landscapes that plunge in and out of the strip’s panels all the while presenting the recurring adventures of Ignatz the mouse and his attempt to “krease the Kat’s bean with a brick.”</p>

<p>Made into an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNrL_-jVvXo">animated cartoon</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Krazy-Kat-Song-Dance-DVD/dp/1606994433">a popular song</a>, a <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Krazy-Kat-Jay-Cantor/dp/0375713824">post-modern novel</a> and even <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Krazy-Kat-Song-Dance-DVD/dp/1606994433">a ballet</a>, Krazy Kat has had its share of admirers, among them poet and artist E. E. Cummings.</p>

<p>An avid collector of <em>Krazy Kat</em> comic strips, Cummings was always on the look-out for what he once called the “Kat of indescribably beauty” (30). Describing himself as “An author of pictures, a draughtsman of words,” Cummings occupies a unique position as both painter and poet. Cummings works both sides of the representational fence conscientiously accounting for visual and auditory signals of language. Like Herriman,	Cummings was playful with the genre, breaking conventions and confounding expectations--well, except for the brick to the head thing.</p>

<p>Like the illustrator and writer of a comic strip, Cummings is very conscious of the formal arrangement of the page as it signals audible remarks, image forms, and narrative logic. Cummings devoured <em>Krazy Kat</em> comics sent to him by friends in America while he was living in the Paris milieu of the 1920s and all its converging artistic movements. During this time, he also adopted the strip’s alliterative “K” in his letters and was beginning in earnest to explore the stylistic techniques that would come to identify his poetry so forcefully. Cummings’	move to break the poetic line, place an emphasis on vernacular language, and a highly visual formulation of the page-space, all find their counterparts in the daily <em>Krazy Kat</em> strips.	Herriman’s playful use of the vernacular, his “strictly irrational landscape in perpetual metamorphosis”—as Cummings called it—and his presentation of the ordinary within the philosophical discourses of self-discovery, appeal to Cummings’ own sense of poetic expression. Moreover, both artists engage in sustained attempts to expand and explode the grammar of their media. By pushing traditional modes of expression in areas such as the line, space, syntax, alliteration, and logic, Herriman and Cummings operate through a creative paradigm that is highly intellectual and incorporates humour, pictorial representation and linguistic play.</p>

<p>In an essay about <em>Krazy Kat</em>, published in the 1946 <em>Sewanee Review </em>and included in a later Collection of Herriman's<em> Krazy Kat </em>strips, Cummings calls the strip “a meteoric burlesk melodrama” (30). The characterization is interesting when taken in concert with Cummings'  "technical" explanation for his poetry in 1926’s <em>is 5</em>: “I can express it in fifteen words, by quoting The Eternal Question And Immortal Answer of burlesque: “Would you hit a woman with a child?—No, I’d hit her with a brick” (180). In qualifications about the nature of art and aesthetics, Cummings frequently refers to elements of the burlesque as they appear in <em>Krazy Kat</em>, highlighting its emphasis on play, humour, and its ability to push the boundaries of what constitutes acceptable representation. In Cummings' letters, he refers to the “the irrefutable down-to-earth authenticity of burlesk” with “its gift of fearlessness, its devastating habit of suddenly debunking the most sacred pomposities. It can be seen miraculously coupled with an infallible pity which is the prerogative of genius." These same qualities are apparent in Herriman's comic strip.</p>

<p>Taking the unity between Cummings’ stern support of individuality in art and life as a cue, there are clearly lines of force between popular culture, the burlesque, <em>Krazy Kat</em>, and Cummings’ formal aesthetics in poetry. The question is, do these supposed similarities between the construction of modernist popular art—burlesque, comic strips—give us access to a new set of definitional criteria through which to understand and define modernist artistic practice more generally, and in those genres we deem "intellectual" or "traditional" or <strong>A</strong>rtistic? There's a ton of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krazy_Kat">commentary on <em>Krazy Kat</em></a> and Herriman on the internets. Do yourself a favour and check into the dialogue. Herriman's strip is one of the most critically interrogated and intellectually lauded of all time. Sometimes, I must admit, I'm not quite sure why; what with the brick to the head thing over and over and over.</p>
