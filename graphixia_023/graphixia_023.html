<p>Reading through both vintage <em>Spiderman</em> comics and the <em>Spider-Man</em> issues that are part of the 2006-07<em> Civil War</em> series, it strikes me that comics are unique when it comes to providing the well-meaning critic with something to do. With comics, particularly those featuring Superheroes but not exclusively, we are always already and simultaneously reading the text through comic's histories and ignoring those same histories to make way for the new.When we first meet him, Spiderman is a compound noun, a single word. His character development is sloppy, the context all over the place, and the storylines--one featuring the aged, pot-bellied "Vulture" as formidable villain--are not yet the pinnacle of the series, but he is as complete as he will ever be--web-slinging, sticky-fingered, red, blue, slant-eyed costume with webbing. It's all there, right at the beginning.</p>

<p>When we see him in the<em> Civil War</em> series, Spider-Man--and by extension Peter Parker--are quite different characters. In fact, gone is the spindly, spectacled science-geek, with the crew-cut and awkward sport coat; in his place we have the beautifully coiffed, physically magnificent, and supermodel-married, experienced superhero--the envy of all who toil below him. In short, Spider-Man, like his hyphen suggests is more Man than he ever was, but the costume remains (at least for the reveal).</p>

<p>The central point here is that, despite the spaces joined by his hyphenated <em>nom-de-plume</em>, we are looking at Spiderman as though he were a compound noun. The adjective--a man who is "spiderish" indicated by the hyphenation--is long gone, and it in its place is a "person / place / or thing" that has a rich, varied history and an accompanying mythology that stretches some sixty-odd years. We are reading a text--the Spiderman--that can be, and has been, edited over and over again, and by different authors in different styles. Spider-man is made up of a never-ending cycle of revision in which the stability of the character's traits, habits, look, age, emotions, etc., are consistently changing, responding to emerging socio-cultural contexts (such as 9/11 in<em> Civil War</em>), and integrating the shifting paradigms of human relationships over time. The issue for readers of course is which Spider-man are we reading? Of course, this question leads to many protracted exchanges about the relative value of a particular era or artist, but it also challenges traditional critical approaches. Can we imagine what James Joyce's<em> Ulysses</em> might look like if it were consistently re-written over the last 60 years, and by different authors? Spider-Man, and the genre to which the character belongs, shows its allegiance to the serialized novel of the Victorian era, but at the same time also rhymes with the often multiplied author and subject-matter of the digital; the daily blog, the collaborative, multi-authored environment of the website, even the "reader pages" at the back of vintage <em>Spider-Man</em> comics mimic the "like / dislike" themes and wall-posting methodologies of social media. In short, <em>Spider-Man</em> is the proverbial #hashtag that trends according to the context in which it finds itself. Our expectations for Peter Parker change, or we ignore the fact that Peter Parker is not who he once was and keep moving. What we don't do is linger over the differences--or inconsistencies--between vintage<em> Spiderman </em>and now<em> Spider-Man</em>, letting them ruin the makings of a good story. Much like life-experiences, we're often drawn to the lure of the new, disregarding the past and descending happily into the maelstrom without accounting for what we already know.</p>

<p>Our Spider-senses tingle, but we don't really check things out and go back to the vintage texts and track the discontinuity. Instead, we revel in the new, modernized storylines, the close-ups of Mary Jane's breasts (one suspects Aunt May is a little leery of them), and the fantastic new costumes, content that this<em> Spider-Man</em> is the same<em> Spiderman</em> we have always known; he has to be. And, in some odd way, he both is the <em>Spiderman</em> we have always known and he is also the <em>Spider-Man</em> we need to know again.</p>

<p>In the end, we're shutting down a lot our critical faculties to look at the pictures and read a <em>Spider-Man</em> storyline. We're accepting a lot of shifting representations and ignoring a lot of history, substituting a consistent--if sometimes reinvented--mythology. What we might be giving up is a self-reflective socio-cultural record of what concerns us or even a common artistic take on the human condition. Suffice to say, <em>Spider-Man</em> is also <em>Spiderman</em>. He is both the symbol of our shifting descriptors--the things that help others distinguish us from the everyday--and a compounded history of all the people, places, and things that have intermingled in the web of our Westernized socio-cultural history. "It's Spider-Man," after all. Or is it?</p>
