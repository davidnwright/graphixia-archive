<p>The most interesting graphic narratives emphasize the problem of trying to see something that cannot be seen, where rather than being worth a thousand words, a picture is no substitute for any number of words, as it testifies to something missing. Thus the “crude,” “primitive,” “impoverished” art of the cartoon engages with the sublime: the overwhelming concept that has no representation.</p>

<p>In <em>Fun Home</em> Alison dreams of leading Bruce up a wooded hill to see perfect sunset. In the dream, however, Bruce is too late and misses the image. What we see is a blankness, as if Bechdel had taken her eraser to the page to “undraw” nothing. This is an allegorical dream moment because homosexuality is a sublime concept for Bruce, something that cannot be represented. For Alison, because of her ability to be “out” and “open,” it is beautiful, everywhere expressible. Alison gets to see the image, while Bruce sees only empty space.</p>

<p>In <em>Ghost World,</em> hints of a world elsewhere abound, from the graffiti of the title (Enid sees the phantom tagger disappearing out of frame in one instance), to the name "Norman" (which we can easily and appropriately shorten to “Norm”) etched in the sidewalk over and over again, to a pair of abandoned pants in the street. These surpluses signify a deficit: who is leaving these signs lying around in the world? The signs culminate in the bus out of town on the cancelled line that carries Enid away at the end of the narrative. Clowes keeps us guessing as to whether the world that we see drawn in the frames is “Ghost World” or the unseen world that is pointed to but never shown.</p>

<p>In <em>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth</em>, Chris Ware draws frame after frame of scenery, and empty world with no people in it. Our eyes are drawn into the frame and the effect is a synaesthetic one: silence. No words, just images of space that create a tension, a need to be populated. The page keeps asking us, “what are you looking at?” <em>Jimmy Corrigan</em> produces the effect of simultaneously being jam packed and empty. The frames are shrunk down so we have to squint to see them. Several pages are filled with tiny, almost unreadable text. Ware appears to be working “around” something that can be neither written nor drawn. Thought of in the terms of literary criticism, <em>Jimmy Corrigan</em> fits the bill of Umberto Eco’s “open” text, or Roland Barthes’ “writerly” text--the kind of book that resists cooptation by its reader and refuses to be “about anything,” that refuses to be “transparent” or to have its machinery appear invisible as the plot works its magic. <em>Jimmy Corrigan</em> challenges the reader to to see the “nothing” that it is about. Or to put it another way, the book tells us that no matter how much we can see, we are still missing something. Jimmy Corrigan’s quest to find his father in Michigan echoes Ahab’s quest to kill the white whale in <em>Moby-Dick </em>to eradicate the whiteness, the bar on vision, the screen that stands between us and the perception of reality, truth. And just as Ishmael’s discursive commentary weaves thousands of words around that whiteness, undercutting Ahab’s linear quest, Ware’s drawing weaves hundreds of images that counter Jimmy’s hope for familial resolution.</p>

<p>Rorschach in <em>Watchmen</em> whose unstable, shape-shifting “mask”  throws onto the reader (viewer?) the responsibility for making sense of the blot; Ernesto in Jason Lutes’ <em>Jar of Fools</em> whose face is often left blank, making him look like a rag doll; Clark Kent’s glasses that render Superman invisible--these are all examples of the graphic narrative reminding its readers of the precariousness of seeing. What you see is not what you get, but, paradoxically, what you don’t get.</p>
