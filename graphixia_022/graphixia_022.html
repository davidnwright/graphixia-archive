<p>Is there anything more tantalizing to the obnoxious literary scholar than the modest hyphen? There it sits, indicating connectedness and yet emphasizing separateness. Everybody* loves to debate the placement of hyphens in a literary text, and here we have one right in our protagonist’s name.</p>

<p>Spider-Man. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvwbVGDk_5A&amp;feature=related">Not Phil Spiderman, as Chandler Bing once joked</a>, but Spider-Man.  With this moniker, Peter Parker (occasionally Palmer) simultaneously connects his humanity to his acquired powers and distances himself from them. He is a Spider-Man in a way that allows him to retain his personhood and not fully become a spider the way, say, the Vulture is not Vulture-Man but rather wholly and completely Vulture. Vulture, as a super-villain, does not need to retain his humanity in quite the same way.</p>

<p>In fact, Spider-Man works hard to keep his identities separate, even within himself:</p>

<p>Which is not to say that this entire post is going to be about hyphens.  But noticing the hyphen did get me interested in the spaces between in these early issues of <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em>: the silences, blank spaces, missing pieces, and need for space articulated throughout the comic.</p>

<p>For example, in the very early issues, much of the action actually happens during the ad breaks.  In <em>Amazing Spider-Man #1</em>, for example, he repairs the capsule during a larger #silence; we don’t actually see the repair, only the success:</p>

<p>Before the ad for “How to Draw Anything!”: </p>

<p>And after:</p>

<p>This happens again in the next issue; fighting Vulture, Spider-Man finds himself inside a water tank.  He escapes, of course, but the mechanism of the escape again happens in the liminal space between the panels (and again, during an ad break) and in a space the reader is simply not privy to.  Instead we are told what will happen, and then that it has happened. We don’t see the process.</p>

<p>And after:</p>

<p>There are lots of potential explanations for this, primary among them likely the fact that a youthful imagination can probably conjure up more glory in the empty space than Steve Ditko (or anyone else) can possibly draw.  These empty spaces allow room for imagination that we don’t always associate with graphic novels and comics, which are usually seen as a show-and-tell medium. It’s also striking that this happens through an ad break -- the advertisements don’t pause the action!  Spider-Man is still Spider-Manning while you’re poring over ads for Saturday Shoe Salesmanship.  Even in contemporary “reality” TV, advertisements almost always pause the action.  This is something different, and in an interesting way it almost encourages a reader to hurry past the advertisements lest he or she miss the action.</p>

<p>I find this particularly interesting when contrasted with scenes where no silence is offered: the fight scenes.  Spider-Man obsessively narrates the fights in a way that allows no room for alternate readings of his conquests.</p>

<p>OH NOES I AM AGAINST THE WALL IN CASE YOU COULD NOT TELL FROM THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING:</p>

<p>One would think this volume of narration would slow down the fight scenes, though it doesn’t seem to have this effect.  It does seem to likewise undercut the show-and-tell medium of the comic, however, given that in these scenes the show is rather less important than the incessant telling.</p>

<p>There are other essential spaces in the text, too -- not least the spaces Peter Parker must find in which to transition into his Spider-Man identity.</p>
			
<p>[picture: spacebetween_07.jpg]</p>
			
<p>Parker goes from being a young man effectively forced into solitude by school bullies to one who seeks out moments alone in order to achieve true greatness.  One of the most interesting debates that emerges through the letters pages is the tension between those fans who want Spider-Man to have a sidekick, partner, or even to join the Fantastic Four, versus those who like that Spider-Man battles through life alone.  Parker gains the esteem of his classmates slowly over the series, but by that point his identity as Spider-Man has created an uncrossable chasm between himself and the other teenagers.</p>

<p>There are missing pieces in the narrative, too.  Like why does J. Jonah Jameson hate Spider-Man so acutely?  How old is Betty supposed to be, anyway?  These empty space only really come to light when one starts to examine the narrative closely, however.  But together, all of these ideas seem to point to the importance of space, absence, and silence in the world of <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em>.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Apropos of nothing, I was quite struck by the inclusion of full names and addresses on the letters pages.  Which generation is it that’s supposed to have a total disregard for privacy, again?</p>

<p>And as a further aside, I really enjoyed revisiting Spider-Man’s origins; reading these early comics has almost repaired the damage done to Spider-Man for me in the <em>Civil War</em> Marvel world event (which was awesome in almost every way except for Spidey being such an epic tool).</p>
