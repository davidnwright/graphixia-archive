<p>Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips' <em>Criminal: The Last of the Innocent </em>#1 transforms the crime comic book into a metafictional (metacomical?) reflection on how comics create meaning. Brubaker and Phillips perform this transformation by incorporating two distinct comics styles, gritty crime comic and “Archie” pastiche, to reflect on temporality, memory, and, ultimately, death. Comics, they suggest, are about our relationship to death and our efforts to repress it as the telos of our everyday existence. They exploit the structure of comics as a sequence of panels each of which “freezes” a moment of action or contemplation.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that Brubaker and Philips have interposed a radically different comics style in their narratives. In the first series of <em>Criminal</em>, Brubaker and Phillips embedded a newspaper detective comic strip, "Frank Kafka, Private Eye" as an absurdist counterpoint to the gritty main story. That newspaper strip interrupts the conventions of the genre, suggesting that what we take as "realism" in the main story is really just a style or mode, just like "Dick Tracy," say. We are reminded of Roland Barthes’ “reality effect” from <em>The Pleasure of the Text.</em> The message is that comics create, rather than represent, a world. And because that world is a sequence of static images, slipping images from other styles or modes into the mix is relatively simple.</p>

<p>Usually, a comic maintains a "look" that the artist does not
			deviate from so that there is continuity from frame to frame.
			Some comics artists, however, like Jessica Alba, in <em>La
			Perdida</em>, or Jason Lutes, in <em>Berlin</em>, will change the
			facial structure of their characters occasionally from frame to
			frame so that they are more like a “realistic” drawing than a
			“caricatured” cartoon. Allison Bechdel, in <em>Fun Home,</em>
			draws characters in photographs so that they contrast with her
			typical representation of them.  But none of these shifts is as
			radical those in <em>The</em> <em>Last of the Innocent</em>.

				Like many comics, <em>The Last of the Innocent</em> is
			structured around binarisms: present and past; city and country;
			crime comic and “Archie” comic. The first terms in these pairs
			appear in Phillips' typical style: black lined panels, lots of
			charcoal pencil effects and chiaroscuro.  The second terms,
			however, appear in clean, flat, four-colour mode with nary a
			shadow to be seen, just like an Archie comic, with the small town
			of "Brookview" standing in for "Riverdale." Our reading
			experience is one of radical alterity. In fact, the first time
			the style switched, I thought panels from a different comic book
			had been spliced into my copy.

				In <em>Last of the Innocent</em>, the idyllic past of the
			small town bleeds into the "criminal" present of the city, so
			that the conventions of Archie-world give way to those of the
			crime comic. The allusiveness of the Brookview panels is not
			difficult to figure out.  "Freakout" is "Jughead" and there's a
			soda shop. The back story for Riley Richards includes  a Betty
			and Veronica struggle over his affections between Felicity and
			Lizzie. Riley moves to the city and marries the rich girl
			"Felix," while Lizzie and Freakout remain in Brookview. But the
			point of the narrative is not simply to spot the connections.
			Rather, the idea is that the stable, unchanging world of the
			Archie comic be submitted to time and death. Felicity cheats on
			Riley with the Reggie Mantle character and Riley decides to  to
			kill her.  The effect is exactly what Freud called "the
			Unheimlich" or "the uncanny;" something all too familiar is
			recast as unfamiliar and frightening.

				The Archie comic represents a world untouched by time, a
			"Grecian Urn" type of space in which Archie is caught in a love
			triangle of infinite variations but without resolution or
			development [1].  The crime story, on the other hand, deals with
			the transitory and fragile nature of life. The genre is all about
			the death that is missing from the Archie comic, presented as a
			sublime thrill. It is difficult to imagine the readerships of the
			two types of comic overlapping because they represent such
			opposite visions of the world. The crime comic is one realm of
			the comics world where continuity does not play much of a role
			because the characters tend to die; and unlike superheroes they
			tend not to come back to life.

				Submitting the world of Archie to that of the crime comic so
			that “Archie” plots the death of “Veronica” ironizes the little
			world of Riverdale/Brookview where she has always been trapped in
			a kind of living death. Innocence, of the type that Archie comics
			represent, is the same double phenomenon that appears in Keats'
			poem: the price of eternal youth is to be frozen in time, or,
			say, stuck in a comic book. The uncanny moment of <em>The Last of
			the Innocent</em> comes when we understand the relationship
			between the two kinds of comics world deaths: the murder of the
			crime comic that violates the quotidian cycle of existence and
			its expectations and the "living death" of a world where nothing
			changes in a meaningful way.

				What these deaths repress is death like that which comes from
			Riley's father's stomach cancer, a death that is neither exciting
			nor preventable. Most of us will not murder or be murdered, and
			none of us will live forever in Riverdale/Brookview. The real
			familiarity that the Archie comic and the ordinary crime comic
			seek to repress is the inevitable and probably quite boring death
			that most of us will face in spite of our efforts to forestall
			it. The final lines of Keat's ode: 'Beauty is truth, truth
			beauty,—that is all/Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.' 
			thinly veil the real capping statement of "Ode on a Grecian Urn"
			and <em>Criminal: The Last of the Innocent</em>: We are all going
			to die. The unmoving picture of the comic book, Archie or
			otherwise, testifies to this inevitability as much as it might
			try to repress it. Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips take the brave
			step of exposing this unfortunate truth.

				[1] <em>Life with Archie</em> introduced transformation to
			Riverdale with Archie marrying Veronica. <em>Last of the
			Innocent</em> includes a "Life with Riley" segment as an
			allusion.
