<p>The recurring theme in Marvel's <em>Civil War</em> arc is sacrifice and loss.  Richard Reed loses Sue and indeed the entire foundation of their relationship -- her awe of his morality and strength -- to Tony Stark's plans.  Stark loses his growing fatherly relationship with Peter Parker and his personal battle with sobriety.  Canada loses its Alpha Flight (a totally unacceptable casualty of war!).  And at the end of it all, Steve Rogers loses his life -- maybe.  Indeed the entire central premise of the Super Hero Registration Act is one of sacrifice, wherein a hero can trade his or her anonymity for government-granted legitimacy.</p>

<p>But sometimes (and often most compellingly), the ones making	the sacrifices aren't the ones in the capes.</p>

<p>From the <em>Road to Civil War </em>imprint on, Mary Jane and Aunt May are pivotal to the choices and decisions Peter Parker makes about his support, and later rejection, of the SHRA.  In these early issues, Peter (and to a certain extent, MJ) treat Stark as a father figure -- it is, we are told repeatedly, Peter's trust in Stark that wins Peter's agreement with the SHRA, even though he has early misgivings.  And while MJ is appreciative of the support they receive from Stark -- especially the new costume that will keep her husband safer -- Stark is also an incredibly intrusive presence, particularly in her life.  (He even has an eagle statue placed in MJ and Peter's room form communication, but MJ wonders if the statue can see into the room and therefore see her at various stages of undress.  Not so fatherly a figure, then.)</p>

<p>In this <em>Road to Civil War </em>series, readers are reminded that Spider-Man has a lot to lose by going public with his identity.  Many superheroes are unattached, or their romantic involvements are with other superheroes, but Peter's deepest attachments are in the civilian world.  Peter, very much a family man in his uncaped life, must sacrifice his privacy -- and therefore the identities of the two people closest to him, MJ and Aunt May -- in order to support Stark's SHRA drive.  In fact, this fact almost stops Peter from unmasking, until his Aunt May presents him with a "classic" Spider-Man costume and remind him of his Uncle Ben's words, adding, "Responsibility means you don't run away when someone asks, 'Who did that?'"</p>

<p>The tragedy in Aunt May giving Peter that final push in favour of registration comes near the end of Civil War, of course, because Peter's deepest fears do come true: Aunt May is shot in the stomach (though the sniper had been aiming for he and MJ).  As Kingpin quotes Euripides, "Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad."*  The question of whether the Civil War has been worth it is perhaps most acute in this moment.</p>

<p>Throughout the texts of <em>Civil War</em>, whether Spider-Man is supporting or rejecting the SHRA, Aunt May and MJ offer uncompromising support.  It's an interesting contrast to Richard and Sue Reed; Sue is empowered to disagree with her husband's position and join with the doomed resistance fighters. Is it her own superheroism that allows Sue to disagree with her powered spouse?  Is there space for an uncaped hanger-on like MJ or Aunt May to disagree with Spidey?  It raises questions about the role of non-powered characters -- who are, of course, usually women and children -- in the Marvel world.  Can they do anything but stand by their men?</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>* Before you jump in and tell me that Aunt May doesn't really die, (1) I'm only dealing with the Civil War arc here, and (2) Peter only saves Aunt May by making a deal with Mephisto: Aunt May will survive if Peter turns back time and erases his marriage to MJ -- and their future daughter, too.  (See the truly terrible<em> One More Day</em> / <em>Brand New Day</em> arcs for that story.)  Pretty significant sacrifice for caped and uncaped, there.  Either Aunt May dies or Mary Jane loses everything she has built her life around.  Oh, Spidey.</p>
