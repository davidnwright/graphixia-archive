<p>Superhero comics remind us about things we’ve missed in a story or things we may not have context to understand through editorial interjections, or annotations. Those little boxes, usually at the bottom of a panel, indicated by a "*" and often signed “Eds” or "The Editors," help us make sense of something happening in a story that relates to a previous event that we might not remember or that we missed because we never read the issue. They help us work out the continuity of on-going story-lines or, more often, the explanation being offered by a character in response to an event the “Eds” remind us of. The interesting part about these editorial interjections isn’t that they exist, but that they almost always refer us back to another issue. They don’t “tell” us anything. Instead, they point us in the right direction, essentially allowing us to cross-reference and find out why a character is saying or doing what s/he is doing.</p>

<p>[*Here’s a great article about these <a href="http://ifanboy.com/articles/being-perfectly-clear-how-extra- information -can-enhance-the-comic-experience/"target="_blank">editorial annotations</a>. Eds.]</p>

<p>By foregrounding the action of going back to an earlier issue, the editors prioritize the act of re-reading (or filling in for new readers) rather than remembering. We are not so much reminded as redirected to another issue. The gambit is this: the editors don’t want us to actually remember what happened in earlier issues. In fact, they assume we won’t remember and will need to go back and read the previous story (again, maybe) to understand the impetus for a character action or claim.</p>

<P>The narrative and story (yes, both) in comics function on a principle of not remembering. Even characters don’t usually remember what they did in previous issues unless it’s a continued storyline or story arc. The act of a character referring to something in the past by remembering is so unique that an editor often needs to interject to remind the reader where this memory was created or worse, justify the need for reintroducing the character again:</p>

<p>In other words, the interjections suggest that memory isn’t that important in superhero comics. Or, if it is important—Batman’s fixation on his parent’s murder for example—it must be portrayed in a static version, unchanging and never fully understood or resolved. A single memory might be the impetus for a lifetime of crime fighting, but a compendium of other memories does not infiltrate upon that initial memory. There’s no growth, no depth, no working toward understanding and resolution.</p>

<p>If, as Jean-Paul Sartre suggests, "the past is the ever growing totality of the in-itself which we are" (Sartre 167), then what exactly are superheroes? Sure, Batman’s past is the totally of the “in-itself that he is,” but I would hardly call it “ever growing.” Superman doesn’t seem to remember anything other than that Mr. Mxyzptlk needs to say his name backwards. Even then, he often comes to the memory late, or is reminded by someone else (often comically the villain his/herself). In short, one of the things superheroes tend to represent is a perspective that dismisses all but the most epic of memories in favour of repetition and routine—they have many habits and they rely on them to get them through most situations.</p>

<P>Superhero comics rely on what Umberto Eco calls iterative development: “A series of events repeated according to a set scheme (iteratively, in such a way that each event takes up again from a sort of virtual beginning, ignoring where the preceding event left off)” (Eco 19). He goes on to suggest that “the device of iteration is […] where one distractedly watches the playing out of a sketch then focuses one's attention on the punch line that re-appears at the end of the episode. It is precisely on this foreseen and awaited reappearance that our modest but irrefutable pleasure is based" (Eco 19). It strikes me that an iterative narrative actually encourages the reader toward habit, away from close reading and scrutiny.</p>

<p>The point of all this is that the comics rely on the reader not only suspending disbelief (a flying guy, really?), but also suspending the affect memory exerts on our reading processes. Most would agree that the more you read, the better you read. Readers tend to pick up references, sink into the stylistics of the genre, navigate disruptions in convention more easily, as they take in more and make themselves informed readers. Comics books pressure the reassurances and certainties that come from habit. Comics force us to forget in order to enjoy the nuances of the repeated story.</p>

<p>The superhero is then miming the interpretive methodology that comics encourage, one that relies on comfort in repetition rather than the challenges of discursiveness. Superheroes are not great models for critical thinking; they are terrible learners.</p>

<p>That said, comics occupy a unique position in that they also encourage the encyclopedic hoarding of discreet facts. I'm looking at you comic book nerd. Despite the necessity of forgetting, readers--especially those who are particularly committed to one character / hero--remember, with sometimes maddening detail, the obscure variations, temporal slips, fractures in continuity, purposeful refigurings featured within the on-going, repeated, narrative.</p>

<p>The action of remembering in comics then has little to do with how the stories engage with the memory of the characters or the event in which they have been involved. Comics, unlike other media that seem to demand attention be paid to the singularity of events that led up to the current "situation" or climax, engage	memory when there is discontinuity, in the subtle turns and twists between the set-up and the punchline. For the seasoned reader, the superhero comic book—and the characters who dwell within it—are precisely “the ever growing totality of the in-itself which we are.” Without the reader’s memory of comics themselves, and the position of those stories in the reader’s psyche, there is no history, no memory. The comic book narrative becomes a fortress of interpretive solitude. To recast Eco's claim, the interpretive action of reading a comic book creates a space in which the personal past of the reader blends with the past iterations of the character. While the narrative sequence and story may be repeated, the reader's past is locked in the moment of encounter. And, the repeated encounters with these narratives and stories yield an intimate history in which the reader's past "is the ever growing totality" in-between the set-up and the punchline; it is the memory.</p>
