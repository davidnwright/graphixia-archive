<p>Thus far in this space, we have restricted ourselves to the discussion of what specific texts represent or themes that those texts foreground. We've discussed how cultural moments and movements intersect with the content of graphic narratives and tried to situate the texts within their proper socio-historical context. In this post, the focus is going to shift slightly, into the margins: the spaces around the comic book. Namely, advertising.</p>

<p>The central question being posed here is whether or not advertising plays a part in the narrative sequence of the comic book. In other words, we might look at how the advertisements respond to, or mimic, the storyline. Do the advertisements address themes running through the comic book? And finally, how do the images in advertisements reflect the images put forward in the comic's ongoing sequence of images. For now, let's stick with an early comic book: Spiderman's first solo appearance in a comic book. The narrative is well known: bitten by a radio-active spider, orphaned teenager Peter Parker searches for a way out of an uncomfortable adolescence using his newfound powers. In the process of understanding his role, Parker makes a decision not to act, inadvertently leading to the death of his Uncle Ben, leaving Parker as the sole breadwinner for himself and his Aunt May.</p>

<p>At first glance, <em>Spiderman</em> appears to be innovative because it represents a "real" teenager with "real" problems. Gone is the one-dimensional moral clarity of Batman or Superman, replaced with the confused emerging personality of a persecuted teenager. Peter Parker, for all his young years, has adult problems that are beyond the comprehension of archetypal superheroes; Parker needs a job, he needs money, and he needs a girl.</p>

<p>Here's where the advertisements come in. Everything Parker needs, the ads offer. Advertisements in the comic book do not sell what we might assume are typical 1950s teenage amusements--sporting goods, music, bubble gum, and hair care products. Instead, they sell muscles (to get the girls), lessons on refrigeration and air conditioning repair (to get the job and the money). In short, the advertisements play off all the insecurities Parker has about his daily life and his self image.</p>

<p>The body builder selling the "secrets of attracting girls" even borrows the superhero trope, calling himself Mike Marvel so as to better represent the possibilities for those who buy the body image he's selling. At the same time, the advertisements for all their address to teenage angst, also seem to be aimed at adults, a supposition further supported by the fact that the ads tend to represent adults in the drawings. The advertisements then tell us something about the socio-cultural context of the comic book: clearly, the advertisers knew that kids weren't the only ones reading Spiderman. Indeed, most of the advertisements call out for "Men" and (or in preference to) "boys."</p>

<p>Often, the advertisements seem to answer the siren call of the narrative. In the <em>Spiderman </em>comic mentioned above, there are some panels in which the narrative arc is dealing with Parker's desperate need for money. The advertisement which follows the cliff-hanging moment in the narrative arc is for a money-making opportunity--one which is predicated on Parker's own dilemma: not knowing how to get started.</p>

<p>What's even more interesting about the lead-in to the advertisement is how Parker foregrounds his thoughts by questioning the validity of other superhero narratives where money doesn't seem to be a problem. Parker's self-examination, and his socio-cultural awareness of superheroes, provide ample basis for an advertisement "reality check" promising quick fixes. Not by accident, Parker's own troubles are soon fortuitously resolved and the advertisement's promises confirmed by the experiences of our "real-world" teenager's ability to land a job working for the man who hates his alter-ego most. The advertisements in early comic books are eclectic and diverse. They represent the fishy--like pet seahorses and dubious coinage schemes (characteristic of the best super-villains)--and the obvious--like drawing classes so one can become a great artist (not a comic book artist mind you). In every way, these advertisements reflect the medium and deserve our attention for what they tell us about the reception and construction of the accompanying graphic narratives.</p>
