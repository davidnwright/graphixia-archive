<p>What's our relationship to the author(s) of a graphic narrative? More precisely how much trust is involved in our interpretation of the author's representation? While these questions certainly reek with the beginnings of a 1980's theory conversation, they point to an interesting sidebar to the act of reading a graphic narrative: we tend to think the meaning is obvious. And why wouldn't we think the meaning's obvious? There are pictures after all. If the reader is confused by the text, she can look at the image for clarification. If she vexed by the image, the reader can look to the text for explanation. What's interesting is how this sense of certainty in the reader's ability to interpret meaning can lead her to overlook some narrative conflicts in the telling of the tale.</p>


<p>Let's take as an example Art Spiegelman's acclaimed graphic narrative <em>Maus</em>. As it explores the experiences of Spiegelman's father during the holocaust, the novel also explores the relationship between the father telling the tale and the son who is retelling the tale being told in graphic form. One of the things readers come to expect when we encounter a memoir such as Spiegelman's is verisimilitude; we want to believe the stories are faithfully rendered--especially when those stories deal with a difficult subject such as the holocaust. Unlike pure fiction,	we expect the memoir to be true, or at least "true enough." For better or worse, as we immerse ourselves in the narrative of the memoir, we tend to forget that the memoir, like the picture it paints, is often constructed, put together, reassembled.</p>

<p><em>Maus</em> opens with diversion, and it's a telling moment in the story. It represents the first moment where the reader can pinpoint a breakdown between the story Vladek is telling and the story Spiegelman is drawing on the page. The first chapter in <em>Maus</em>, "The Sheik," focuses on Vladek's early life before the holocaust, what Vladek deems a private moment. For Vladek, the story is clearly the holocaust, not him. However, Spiegelman has other motivations that creep into the rendering of his father's tale. The first hint that Spiegelman may not be representing his father's accounts accurately comes when Spiegelman draws Vladek on a bicycle saying he "looked just like Rudolph Valentino."</p>

<p>To most readers, the comment is read as an exaggeration of Vladek's handsomeness and Spiegelman's drawing of the old man hunched over his stationary bike, cycling, doesn't help confirm the reader's sense that Vladek is exaggerating. Right away readers are positioned, by virtue of how and what Spiegelman is showing us, to question the accuracy of Vladek's story-telling and the extent to which it is "true." Another instance of Spiegelman's manipulation of his father's account comes at the end of the diversion. After Vladek asks his son not tell the story in his comic book, Spiegelman promises not to tell the story:</p>

<p>Of course, the story has already been told at this point, and the broken promise revealed to the reader. Again, the reader is forced to question the relationship between the story as it was told (Vladek's story) and how it is being told to the reader (Spiegelman's story). Suddenly, reading the graphic narrative just got very complex; the reader cannot help but wonder: whose story is this? And, whose images of the past am I looking at? With great frequency throughout the novel, Spiegelman's images contextualize--and distort--Vladek's past. The images, while certainly heightening the visceral resonance of Vladek's holocaust narrative, still distort the reader's reception of that narrative; this is not Vladek's story, it is Spiegelman's. The images, rather than clarifying and illuminating the narrative, distort the verisimilitude of Vladek's memoir. This complexity is compounded by the nature of the subject being addressed in the memoir. The reader is--and often rightly--reluctant to challenge the authenticity of the Survivor's Tale. However, careful readers and good critics know that the brutality of the subject is no reason enough to avoid delving into questions of representation. Moreover, by including the opening chapter diversion away from the dominant subject-matter of the novel, Spiegleman leaves the door open for this kind of resistant interpretive questioning by the reader.</p>

<p>To this end, the opening aphorism that prefaces the book offers yet another telling juxtaposition. Quoting Hitler, the book opens with the lines "The Jews are undoubtedly a race, but they are not human." Without question sinister words by a madman, but words that, given Spiegelman's aesthetic decisions rendering characters in the book, reflect the tangible reality to follow in the creative narrative. Indeed, in <em>Maus</em>, the Jews are not human; they're mice. Does Spiegelman's aesthetic decision to represent Jews as mice reflect or mock Hitler's comment? What about all the other non-humans in the novel: Germans = Cats / Poles = pigs? In short, the images Spiegelman gives us don't really help us to comprehend or contextualize Hitler's text, or even understand why Spiegelman put it at the beginning of his book. In fact, Hitler's claim oddly complicates, or problematizes, the intended meaning for text and image in the novel.</p>

<p>Finally, there's the visual metaphors that play off of Vladek's stationary bike. Tending to appear at the beginning of each of Vladek's recollections about his Holocaust experience, the bike suggests a kind of "spinning of wheels" and both mocks and downgrades Vladek's story-telling while it elevates Spiegleman's.</p>

<p>There is	little question that Spiegelman is the artist here and the old man is just spinning tales the same way he has told them over and over and over. At the same time, the image of Vladek on the bike further reduces him to character--a kind of distracted historian who lacks the requisite artistic capability to see the significance and resonance of his story. Vladek is not artist or story-teller, he is merely a survivor--his experiences reduced to the raw material for an aesthetic experience. Unlike Spiegelman who can go in and out of the past--visiting his father as he pleases, returning home to his wife--Vladek is stuck in the past, destined to relive his memories. The wheel of time is moving forward, but Vladek is not going anywhere with it. The image of Vladek on the bike complicates the reader's reception of his narrative and at the same time highlights the artifice involved in reassembling Vladek's narrative; without Spiegelman's aesthetic skills, the story would read like any other survivor tale spinning its wheels and going nowhere.</p>

<p>This leads us back to where we came in. Do the images in <em>Maus</em>add or detract from the text? The answer is they do both, and they do both in a way that demands close reading and scrutiny for multiple meanings. The tendency to over-simplify the reading of graphic narrative is a tendency Spiegelman exploits to pressure our understanding and reception of a historical event kept alive in the stories of its few remaining survivors.</p>
