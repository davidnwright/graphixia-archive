<p>Speaking of apocalypse, what if David Mazzucchelli’s Asterios Polyp allegorizes the events of the morning of September 11, 2001 in New York City? The text provides a fair amount of evidence for the idea: Asterios, with his “double” obsession enthuses about the architecture of the Twin Towers; when Asterios’ building is struck by lightning and burns, Asterios says to himself, “not again”; whenever Asterios has a fantasy/dream sequence about his still-born twin brother Ignazio, a plane appears on the horizon; and a huge crater occupies the very centre of this unpaginated volume. If this is the case, Asterios’ personal apocalypse of jetisonning his past life and starting over at “ground zero,” is woven into an American national apocalypse. But “woven into” is the wrong metaphor, perhaps. Rather, the American apocalypse is something that we see out of the corner of our eye as we read Asterios’ story, except when it is staring us right in the face in the middle of the text.</p>

<p>Students ask legitimate questions about the indirectness of this kind of allegory. If a person wanted to write a book about 9/11 why wouldn’t he or she make it plain? Why all the hints and innuendo? Why is the plane  off on the horizon and not smashing into a tower? It’s not as if the  image of a plane crashing into one of the towers is unrepresentable.  There is a comic book version of the 9/11 Report after all. And if the  book is an allegory, it isn’t symmetrical. In the story of the Polyp  twins, one dies at birth and the other lives, at least until moments  after the conclusion of the text when a meteor smashes into him. Reading  Asterios Polyp isomorphically, as a map of 9/11, proves to fraught with  problems. And yet we cannot escape some sort of equation between this story of an architect whose buildings never get built and the infamous destruction of the World Trade center. </p>

<p>Allegory is a funny business. It is difficult to say why it re-routes what it is about through some other story like a literary version of Freud’s dream work, condensing and displacing traumatic instances. Why bother creating an equation between what happens in the text and some external event? And once we “get” the allegory–”Oh, this is about 9/11”–then what? Does the story of Asterios Polyp disappear in a puff of smoke? Is 9/11 in any way better understood by being put through this process? It may be that allegory itself is apocalyptic, dependent on veiling and unveiling the truth, showing and hiding in such a way as to make readers conspiracy theorists, who gasp when they see the “hidden” pattern but don’t pause to think that the pattern was never really that hidden, and ultimately could have been stated forthrightly in the first place. The better novels of Thomas Pynchon play this game, but the ultimate exponent of it is Melville’s Moby-Dick, with its constant veiling and unveiling of the whale. Asterios Polyp, then, participates in a strong tradition of American literature. And this tradition participates in the way The United States constructs itself as an imagined community, both allegorical and apocalyptic: a new world; a new Canaan; the last, best hope of mankind.</p>

<p>Mazzucchelli’s story both mimics and destabilizes this construction. Asterios Polyp lingers on failures of the American idea. For instance, in a dream/fantasy sequence, Asterios visits the Vietnam Memorial and finds the name of his brother Ignazio on the wall. In Apogee, on July 4,2000, while they watch the town Independence Day parade, Ursula Major regales Asterios with the history of American Indians and the way their land was taken from them and their culture destroyed. This Independence Day was, of course, the last one before 9/11.</p>

<p>When Asterios heads off to Apogee with only the clothes on his back, a Zippo lighter, a watch, and a Swiss Army knife, he strips himself down. He gives up architecture and becomes an auto mechanic. This new beginning is a journey into humility that opposes power, abstraction and arrogance. Asterios gives up one great American myth for another: the fantasy of a return to simplicity, where ordinary people (auto mechanics) rather than elite specialists (architects) hold the key to to the ideal life. Nevertheless, this notion of striving for humility after a disaster has a kind of allegorical force. Every apocalyptic moment is an opportunity to rethink the world and one’s place in it. Every allegory, like the simplest animal fable, is a chance to re-evaluate morals and values.</p>
