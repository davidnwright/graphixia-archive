<p>Given that I’m a heavily invested comic book collector who purchases (and reads)</p>

<p>nearly a hundred titles a month, many other collectors and casual readers have been asking for my take on the recent DC reboot of its entire superhero comics’ franchise. This reboot, which DC dubbed “The New 52,” signals a sea change in the publishing magnate’s history – for the first time, DC restarted the longest running of its titles, Action and Detective comics, along with every other title in its superhero canon, resetting all 52 titles of the DC Universe all to issue #1. The only titles left unscathed were those from its Vertigo imprint, with Hellblazer now being DC’s longest running, continuous monthly ongoing series. The reboot is, however, not just a simple renumbering of DC’s titles (they had tried that previously with several other series in the mid 1980s after “Crisis on Infinite Earths,” though not with its longer running titles that had been established in the Golden Age), but a complete overhaul of the line, with all continuity rules revoked and all characters’ histories, costumes and environments rendered mutable for a new generation of authors and readers. In this universe, Superman has never met Batman and he is new to the public eye (no underwear on the outside of their costumes either now), the Justice League is a new invention, and Dick Grayson has apparently never been Batman – none of the nuances, and often even the broad strokes, of the stories of the last seventy-plus years are meant to carry any weight regarding character development. This was a significant gamble on the part of DC’s creative team of Dan DiDio, Jim Lee and Geoff Johns, and while the general mainstream media thought that the move was compelling, the message boards on DC’s website showed significant skepticism and, at times, outright hostility; why were these characters, with whom readers had identified and grown up with, being completely revamped? Moreover, does “The New 52” actually meet these expectations? Despite the general protests to the contrary. These answers lie not in the creative, cerebral process of writing, but in the nuts and bolts of the publishing industry itself.</p>

<p>First, however, a little recent history for those who are unfamiliar with the lead-up to “The New 52” and how it came about in the DC Universe. DC’s Chief Creative Officer, Geoff Johns, began the reboot with his summer event</p>

<p>[picture: fp_teaser_02.jpg]</p>
		
<p>Flashpoint, a miniseries that spanned thirteen separate three-issue arcs plus several one shots (the total issue count for the story rounding out at a planned 52). The plotline centres on the Flash, Johns’ staple character who he’d written for years previously. Barry Allen, the recently resuscitated Silver Age Flash, is thrown into a universe rife with discontinuities such as Batman’s secret identity being Thomas Wayne (Bruce having been shot instead of his parents), half of Europe having been sunk in a war between Atlantis and the Amazons, and Superman having been found by the military instead of by the Kents, locked up as a secret weapon for the US government. The stories see some very talented writers being given free rein to upset character conventions and essentially trace out a “What If?” of the DCU in a fashion similar to what Marvel had	accomplished (with great success) a few years prior with its summer event “House of M.” The cause of the skewing of continuity (spoiler alert), is Professor Zoom’s time traveling murder of Barry Allen’s mother, a problem that gets remedied (through means too complex to discuss here) by the end of Flashpoint. The final pages of the last issue of the miniseries show readers that there is indeed a logic to the then-upcoming reboot: All of the continuities, past and present, merge into one due to Barry Allen’s tinkering with the timestream, resetting the DC Universe into a single whole, a fresh starting point that bears some similarities with past stories, but also one that contains many differences. What results is the aforementioned “New 52,” a supposed renewal and revitalization of the DCU that is, because of Flashpoint, also speciously (almost paradoxically) aligned with current continuity.</p>

<p>Because comics are marketed to their readers three months in advance of their publication date, comic fandom caught wind of the upset early on, seeing that their next months’ purchase would not be Action Comics #905</p>

<p>but Action Comics #1, and that this Superman would be dramatically different from the character they had previously known. Responding to the often vitriolic comments from fans on the message boards, DiDio published, at	the back of every DC comic book two months prior to “The New 52,” the	logic and motivation behind the change, followed by an impassioned	request to keep readers reading, regardless of the fact that the current	stories would be written out of continuity only a couple months in the	future. As DiDio himself put it, “Why buy DC comics in August? After all,	if everything is starting over in September, why not just wait to start	reading books again?” DiDio, at the close of his response, provides the	answer that one should remain a DC reader “because you love comics, and	we make some of the best ones out there.” The request itself is	interesting in that it addresses the concerns that readers had regarding	the reboot at all – if they were significant enough to merit a full-page addressing in every issue of the DCU, then one wonders why the company	would have opted for the change in the first place. The company line	itself seems torn as well in both denying the import of continuity in	superhero comics while reaffirming it at the same time; DC’s Executive	Editor writes of Flashpoint that “[what’s] appearing here pretty much sets you up for DC – The New 52. You can’t let Flashpoint go as something that does not count. It’s the gateway into what’s coming in September.” The paradox was something of a problem for readers, who were being told to ignore continuity while at the same time being told to purchase DC strictly because of it.</p>

<p>The answer lies in something that we have discussed very little in Graphixia, being the fact that comics, beyond their content, are marketable goods. The costs of their publication are increasing, from paper to ink to artists’ wages, and DC plays (or played) second string to Marvel’s market dominance for some time now. Coupled with this, print media in general is in a steady decline. The print runs of even DC’s most successful titles (in Justice League and Green Lantern) were dropping significantly, and the company was struggling to maintain relevance. DiDio called, in a letters page similar to the one discussed above, for a throwback to the popularity of comics in the 1990s (which, admittedly, killed the market due to overpublication) with the return of variant covers, polybagged issues and marketing techniques that would allow the company to thrive in this changing environment – ironically, what was needed was a return to past efforts. The new 52 #1 issues then were then accompanied by a host of variant covers as well as a polybagged Justice	League #1 which included a code to access the comic online, viewable on the</p>

<p>iPad or a similar eReader, along with DC’s promise that all new publications would be available for purchase on the DC website the same day that they hit comic shop shelves. Beyond this, DiDio claimed that the new #1s would draw in new readers who had been, to this point, put off by the long-running histories that were potentially ostracizing to a readership unfamiliar with them or unwilling to do the required, often grueling research to get caught up with current continuity. Everyone, DiDio exclaimed, can now own their own copy of Action Comics #1 (albeit a problematic claim, given that the company was attempting to divorce its own history while relying on the historical popularity of both its titles and characters).</p>

<p>The plan was, in short, incredibly effective. The marketing campaign, which was as far reaching as traditional newspapers and television, resulted in DC’s selling out of every title, with multiple prints having to be offered for the more popular titles – Justice League #1 is currently on its fourth printing, and several other titles have reached their third. Needless to say, for the last few months Marvel has been soundly trounced (despite an effort to copy DC’s newfound popularity by resetting its own long-running title Uncanny X-Men to issue #1 this month). DC has indeed returned to the sales figures of the past, at least for the time being, though the effectiveness of the long-term applications of the reboot remains in question. The problem lies in the fact that DC did not live up to its intended concept regarding the writing of its titles – it has marketed incredibly well, but the problems with content limiting the readership, a point that has been previously noted both in Graphixia’s podcasts and posts, remain. DC may have sold thousands more copies than anticipated of its #1s, though it did not sell the stories that it promised its readers.</p>

<p>“The New 52” is a melee of authors experimenting with the titles they have written for for, in many cases, several years. Understandably, however, there appears to have been some significant resistance to the reboot on the part of some of the authors, especially as regards the Green Lantern host of titles – the authors here, Peter Tomasi, Tony Bedard, Peter Milligan and Johns himself, haven’t missed a beat and are writing, despite the #1 on the cover of their books, as nuanced and detailed stories that are directly reliant on the</p>
			
<p>[picture: new52_05]</p>
		
<p>previous story arcs as if nothing had happened in the franchise. Flashpoint is not referred to, nor are there any noticeable alterations of continuity at all in the Green Lantern universe - in fact, in the aftermath of the recent "War of the Green Lanterns" arc that spanned three titles and a separate miniseries, it is more important than ever to do back reading to make sense of the current "entrypoint" that DC has established with the new #1 Green Lantern titles. Action Comics and Superman, however, are at odds even with each other, with Grant Morrison on the former title apparently being given carte blanche to write Superman as he sees fit without acknowledging even the continuity that is being newly established (as he did with his much lauded “All-Star Superman”) in the other Superman related series. Other titles have arisen seemingly to fill the number count of 52, with little in the way of content or storytelling – these are, most notably, Liefeld’s “Hawk and Dove” and J T Krul’s tepid take on “Green Arrow,” though there are several others that fall into this category. One is left wondering how long the 52 titles can last without a cancellation in their midst, though it’s too early to speculate at this point. That said, some of the titles have shown some promise, including Tony Daniels’ “Detective Comics” and, most especially, newcomers like Jeff Lemire’s “Animal Man,” though these were arguably strong and innovative titles prior to the relaunch as well, and little has changed in their telling.</p>

<p>How then, do I respond, when people ask me about what I think about “The New 52”? My answer is typically “not much.” The stories that were strong prior to the reboot remain strong, largely because their authors have ignored the mandate of their publishing company; the weaker stories and characters remain weak, despite the presence of popular and up-and-coming authors; the new stories could have been told without the fanfare of the reboot at all. What I have to acknowledge however, especially given my print culture background, is that the reboot was necessary – without it, the company would likely have failed within a few years, with its characters being sold to other houses or being lost forever, much as what happened with Archie’s now defunct superhero line of comics or the critically acclaimed Miracleman by Alan Moore, which is currently held up in copyright limbo. In a sort of metacommentary on DC’s situation, Lois Lane identifies the problem herself in the new Superman #1. Referencing the destruction of the Daily Planet to make way for a new Planet owned and operated by the larger Galaxy Media, a self-professed “multimedia news super station,” she attests to a troubled Clark Kent that “You’ve seen the reports! You’ve seen the figures! Print is dying! We need this to survive!” It appears that if “The New 52” has been effective at anything, it is in the success of market dominance, if not a return to successful storytelling. This is likely why the creative team has been so problematic, as previously mentioned, in writing about the changes to the DCU themselves; there is a hint of Janus about the turn, in the attempt to draw in new readers with the promise of new continuities while quietly ensuring that the old readers are not left behind, even if they are telling us to expect a complete overhaul. What remains is a cunning revival of the comic as a product, a highlighting of the import of the commoditization of the story and the need to ensure the vitality of the market through whatever means necessary, regardless of how extreme they may at first appear. More uplifting, however, is a similar note from aforementioned Superman #1 that is a little more optimistic: the new owner of the Daily Planet (read DC), Morgan Edge, states to a press conference, “I know that many of you are greeting this day with mixed emotions and perhaps even some trepidation. After all, change is seldom easy. In fact, it can be downright painful. But, to paraphrase and mutilate the words of William Shakespeare: I’ve come not to bury the Planet, but to raise it.” Despite the dramatic overtones of the supposed “change,” this reader, at least, is glad of gimmicky nature of “The New 52,” if only because it means the continuation of the superhero comics’ industry and DC’s relevance in the world of print publication.</p>
