<P><em>Daytripper</em> by Brazilian twin brothers Fábio Moon and Gabriel Bá does a number of things that should doom a comic to failure. First of all it’s gimmicky: at the end of each issue the main character, Bras de Oliva Domingos, dies. Furthermore, when we first meet him in issue #1, he’s an obituary writer. So he’s a guy who writes about other people’s deaths and then dies himself. Second, <em>Daytripper</em> is as sentimental as all get out. Bras’ deaths terminate stories about relationships with women, his father, his best friend, his mother, and so on. Each of his deaths has a distinct emotional impact hooked to the specific relationship he has with different characters.</p>

<p>The sentimentality of <em>Daytripper</em> is part of its charm, however, and the art reinforces it. Bras has a sweet, hang dog kind of look. He is kind and thoughtful. There is nothing anti-hero about him. He loves his dog, his wife, and his child. He has a good friendship with a co-worker at the paper.</p>

<p>Offsetting obvious ironies and sentimentality is the way that the deaths are not in chronological sequence; the issues  jump around. Readers are thus invited to find patterns other than chronology to interpret the sequence, like relationship vectors, for instance. One pattern is that characters tend to appear in the issue previous to the one in which they play a key role in some aspect of Bras’ life. We ask, what would it mean if he died now? or now? or now? And when he appears again in the next issue, perhaps older, perhaps younger, we get a sense of cheating death and cheating at the rules of narrative trajectory. If the horizon of death lures us through stories as the ultimate telos, <em>Daytripper</em> screws with that notion, presenting trajectories that would look like an airline’s map of destinations.</p>

<p>Of course, writing obituaries is not what Bras aspires to; he would rather be a successful writer like his father. Perhaps the only negative emotion Bras shows is a kind of resentment towards his father’s fame. In the first issue, Bras’ dissatisfaction with being an obituary writer is set against a state celebration of his father’s accomplishments. Eventually he achieves success as a writer, writing a rather hideously titled novel called <em>Silken Eyes</em>. But “success” comes to mean many things: being a good son, father, husband, friend.</p>

<p>Those who read the whole series will find that the anticipation of Bras’ death in each issue becomes something of a joke: “I wonder how he’s gonna get it this time." Issue #3 even jokes about its own narrative strategy. Bras’ friend Jorge mimics the closing of each issue when he says that Bras has died of a broken heart: “Thing is...nobody told Bras he was dead, so he showed up for work anyway." This gimmick does achieve its aim of making us contemplate the fragility of life through giving Bras	multiple deaths, as if he were a cat. What if Bras were to “really” die in issue #1 in which his father gets a state tribute for his contribution to Brazilian Letters, and Bras is a mere newspaper obituary writer? What if he were to die as a child during a family visit to his grandparents’ farm? In each case, the telos of the story makes us reconstruct the life that lead up to it.</p>

<p>If <em>Criminal: The Last of the Innocent</em> is about the relationship between murder and innocence, <em>Daytripper</em> is about how death frames our everyday existence. It could happen now, now, now. So each moment moment of pleasure or insight is somehow stolen from death. As Bras’ father says, “Life is made of such moments, son. Relationships are based on such moments, such choices, such actions...” The final moment of death is the end point of many moments of pleasure and insight, of life. For each of us, Bras’ father says, one moment of life stands above all the rest. And this moment is the moment of death’s counterpart.</p>

<p>For example, when Bras meets his wife to be in a grocery store/ coffee shop, the moment is as accidental as the moments throughout the series that cause his death. In that issue, Bras dies when he is struck by a delivery truck as he runs back to tell the woman about his feelings. But the story cheats death when he shows up married to her in the next issue. As superheroes show us time and again, comics is a medium whose characters die and come back to life over and over again. <em>Daytripper</em> turns that gesture into a reflection on what life means.</p>
