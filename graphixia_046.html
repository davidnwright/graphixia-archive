<p>Our report from the First International Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels: <a href="http://www.institutofranklin.net/en/conferences/graphic-novel">Sites of Visual and Textual Innovation</a>" at the <a href="http://www.institutofranklin.net/en">Instituto Franklin</a> in Alcala de Henares, Spain.</p>

<p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>

<p>Having missed the panels on the first day of the "<a href="http://www.institutofranklin.net/en/conferences/graphic-novel"> Sites of Visual and Textual Innovation</a>" conference at the <a href="http://www.institutofranklin.net/en">Instituto Franklin</a> in Alcala de Henares, Spain because of a late flight, today (Thursday November 10, 2011) was all action.</p>

<p>One of the highlights of the day was <a href="http://www.csm.arts.ac.uk/research/staffresearchprofiles/drrogersabin/">Roger Sabin</a>'s keynote talk on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sloper">Ally Sloper</a>, the Victorian comic, and promotional culture in England. While Sabin estimated that only 1% of English people today know about Sloper, in his time, he was hugely popular with the working class. Sabin's emphasis was on the "paratext" in <em>Ally Sloper</em>, the advertisements, contests, and other materials that showed Ally Sloper spilling out of the comic and entering other cultural forms.</p>

<p>The range of good papers included <a href="http://chi.academia.edu/IanHague">Ian Hague</a>'s "Comics as a Tactile Medium" on the "feel" of comics both paper and digital and how the haptic, tactile experience informs the way we perceive comics. <a href="http://comicsforum.org/">He talked</a> about how the shape and hardness of Spiegelman's <em>In the Shadow of No Towers</em> related to enduring memories of 9/11 and various force feedback mechanisms (vibrations and such) in digital versions of Brian O'Malley's <em>Scott Pilgrim.</em></p>

<p>The conference represents the wide variety of research being done on comics today, from avant garde work to mass produced superhero comics. But more than criticism is on offer. Practitioners such as Joris Vermassen are also talking about their work. Vermassen showed his work on a new form of combining images (paintings and drawings) and 200 word stories. It involves 20 by 20 centimeter panels that can interact with each other in various ways. While Vermassen produces traditional comics, he is finding the new form a liberating one. I eagerly anticipate the results.</p>

<p>Day 2</p>

<p>At long last, I report on my second day at the <a href="http://pepoperez.blogspot.com/2011/11/el-congreso.html"><em> First International Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels</em></a> in Alcala de Henares, Spain. These are, of course, just highlights from my perspective. And I invite any correction to my presentation of these talks.</p>

<p>Pedro Moura, "A Typology of Experimentation in Comics"</p>

<p>Moura presented a fascinating tour through the various manifestations of avant garde, non-narrative comics. Moura follows Deleuze and Guattari in seeking an absolutely deterritorialized comics, a minor comics. That is, he is not interested in comics that "experiment" only to re-assert conventional storytelling and meaning. Rather, he seeks a kind of comic that is only comic, not a vehicle for narrative content.</p>

<p>Thomas Byers, "Comix Theory: The Justice League of Europe's Attack on Deconstruction"</p>

<p>Byers presented a critique of phallic displacement in a little-known DC comic in which the Justice League of Europe, under the temporary leadership of Batman, take on "Deconstructo" a villain who espouses a kind of aesthetic nihilism and relativism. Byers reads the comic as a typical attack on deconstruction, aligning it with the New York Times' notorious obituary for Jacques Derrida. Byers turns the comic on its head, revealing its anxiety over the loss of the phallus. He justified the Lacanian turn in his argument because of the way that all theory tends to be lumped together in the eyes of its detractors.</p>

<p>Jose Alaniz, "Czech Comics Anthropology: Life and Story in Keva"</p>

<p>Alaniz discussed the project of ASTA SME which combines comics and anthropology. <em>Keva</em> is one volume in a trilogy focusing on the Roma in the Czech republic. Keva is the youngest and most integrated of the three subjects. The novel element of this comic is the way it engages with the life of the subject. For instance, the authors asked Keva how she wished to be drawn in the text. Her response was a composite of pop culture icons. She wanted the legs of Mariah Carey, for instance. Alaniz referred to this kind of text as a "negotiated story," in which the subject participates in his or her construction. Alaniz discussed the range of drawing styles in the book, from cartoony to something approaching photo-realism. This range demonstrates	the power of comics to "comment" on the content under representation. The talk was fascinating, and <em>Keva</em> is probably worth picking up even though it has not been translated into English.</p>

<p>Simon Grennan, "Demonstrating Discours: Two Comic Strip Projects in Self Constraint"</p>

<p>Grennan's main point was that comics narratology has focused on "histoire," what is told, rather than "discours," the putting into action of the story, or the "telling to." Grennan used a page from Seth's <em>Clyde Fans</em> and Mike Madden's <em>99 Ways to Tell A Story</em>. Each of these texts works with a constraint. Seth restricts himself to the temporal and stylistic conventions of the <em>New Yorker</em> magazine, with nothing appearing that is not "American" or post 1960, while Madden writes the same story over and over again according to different generic principles. Grennan argued that Seth's work made sense in terms of discours, while Madden's simply repeated his own style over and over again. In other words, Seth's working within the constraint works, while Madden's doesn't because "discours" contradicts "histoire," particularly in the version of his story that employs the fantasy genre.</p>

<p>Day 3</p>

<p>From my perspective, the last day of the <a href="http://www.institutofranklin.net/en">Instituto Franklin</a> comics conference in Alcala was perhaps the best for me in terms of developing my own understanding of how comics work.</p>

<P><img title="More..." src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/ wordpress/ img/trans.gif" alt="" /></p>
			
<p>The early morning "Theory" session featured <a href="http://castle.eiu.edu/agora/Dec03/Kuipall.htm">Chris Kuipers</a>, a fellow alumnus from the University of California, Irvine, arguing that the graphic novel as the latest "royal genre," following on from the novel and the epic in "Epic, Roman, Graphic Novel: Three Royal Genres". A "royal" genre governs the way literature is thought about in any particular era, embodying the technology of the period, which is partly responsible for its transformation and incorporation of previous genres. The comic's engagement with web technology is a component of its potential for dominance. <a href="http://www.iup.edu/page.aspx?id=58879">Kuipers</a> pointed out that "graphic novel" is a weak term for this kind of text; it is a term trying to gain credibility from a past genre, and does not adequately represent what long form comics are.</p>

<p><a href="http://psychology.stanford.edu/btversky">Barbara Tversky</a>, a cognitive psychologist from Stanford, presented a fascinating talk ("Aspects of Depictions in Graphic Narrative")	about how comics are perceived in terms of action and complexity, dependent on culture. Her discussion started with visual (iconic?) instructions, such as a blow-up diagram and instructions on how to put together a bookshelf, and related how the mind processes them to the way it processes a comic.</p>

<p>Nicolas Thiessen, in "You Don't Know How to Read a Comic" took issue with formalist approaches to reading comics, suggesting that the intuited pattern of moving from left to right and top to bottom was in no way a necessity. His argument hinged on the Heideggerian notion of equipment, which has no existence as equipment separate from its use. Likewise, form does not	inhere in a comic, but rather is imposed on it through our reading of it.</p>

<p>Perhaps my favorite presentation from a session on experimental narrative was <a href="http://www.informationenvironments.org.uk/research-projects.html"> Ian Horton</a> on "Information Design, Experimental Comic Books, and Narrative Form." Again, Ikea and Habitat instructions played their role in getting at how comics work. He then moved on to Will Eisner's comics instructions for the US army to address issues of complexity and functionality in these	instructions. Horton challenged the notion that representing instructions visually through comics does not necessarily simplify matters. H then discussed Chris Ware's Acme Novelty Library #20, popularly known as <em>Lint</em> to show the elements of information design that Ware has incorporated into his overtly aestheticized work.</p>

<p>The keynote, and closing, speech of the day was <a href="http://www.csun.edu/~ch76854/">Charles Hatfield</a> appraising the state of independent comics in 2011. Hatfield used four examples: Adrian Tomine's latest issue of <em>Optic Nerve</em> , the latest issue of the Hernandez brothers Love and Rockets, a licensed <em>Simpsons</em> property, <em>Treehouse of Horror</em>, and an experimental comics broadsheet,<em>Pood</em>. Hatfield discussed the impact of large publishing companies like Bertelsmann and MacMillan taking on Drawn and Quarterly and Fantagraphics titles, the diminishing power of the direct market comics shop model, and the way that "graphic novels" as long form "high end" texts have perhaps eclipsed the "floppy," as the slim, soft-covered, stapled comic is commonly known. As what was formerly been independent has been co-opted by the mainstream, Hatfield, sees mini comics and webcomics as the new inhabitants of the independent realm.</p>

<p>In giving synopses of these talks, I am sure that I have distorted them. In order to correct that distortion, you should seek out the published versions of these papers which are sure to come out.</p>
