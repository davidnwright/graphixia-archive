<p>While the graphic narrative for the most part has its roots in the forward-thinking mythologies of science-fiction, the medium is nonetheless dominated by memoir, the re-telling of tales told, and after-the-fact reportage. In particular, longer graphic narratives, those which have come to be called graphic novels, are dominated by the narrative structures of the memoir and detective fiction, both of which involve the recounting of an already played-out scenario. Both Will Eisner's  <em>A Contract with God</em> and Art Spiegelman's Pulitzer-Prize-winning <em>Maus </em>are memoir--in the case of the latter a second-hand memoir--while Frank Miller's re-imagining of the superhero-detective Batman in <em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</em> and the detective epic <em>Watchmen</em> by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons evolve through an unravelling of entwined narrative moments. In short, a medium which often responds to the optimism and anxieties of the future is often steeped in a deep-seated reckoning with the past.</p>

<p>At the same time, the vast majority of characters in graphic narratives are dealing with their pasts or issues associated with the past. Alison Bechdel tries to make sense of both her father's and her own past; Spiegelman grapples with the Holocaust and his own relationship with his father; Jimmy Corrigan sets out on a crusade to find his missing father, and family heritage; Bruce Wayne wrestles awkwardly with retirement in <em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</em>; the characters in <em>Watchmen</em> reckon with pasts both their own and of others. Even Superman is ultimately dealing with being an orphan on a strange planet eking out a renewed history because he has lost his own. Perhaps the most evident example of an artist / author grappling with narratives of the past is Art Speigelmen's direct address to the guilt he begins to feel about the success of his graphic novel <em>Maus</em>. Rendering himself literally drawing on the backs of his executed ancestors, Spiegelman recognizes that his heritage--and the horrors associated with it--is at once providing a story / narrative sequence and increasingly forcing his "present" self to confront the diverse meanings and interpretations his aesthetic creates for that heritage. In other words, as he investigates his past--or more appropriately, his parents' past--the story draws to a close and there is less and less to feed his creativity as his aesthetically original cat / mouse / dog / pig metaphors play themselves out.</p>

<p>The image above suggests other possible interpretations. For instance, the image invokes the millions of dead stories that went nowhere--that just stopped dead--upon which Spiegelman is building his own narrative. In a sense, Spiegelman is writing out the futures of all these dead souls through his encounters with his father’s survival narrative.</p>

<p>Of course, the central point here is that Spiegelman does not tell his father's story, or his mother's (lost in her death and missing diary), but the story of his own revelation <em>about</em> his father's story. The story--if it can be charitably called that--of the holocaust has been told many times and many ways, Spiegelman's re-telling is in <em>his</em> interpretation of it--and this is where the reader's attention and interest lie.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Will Eisner simply announces that he is telling stories already told:</p>

 <p>The tenements give Eisner an opportunity to share <em>his</em> vision of childhood through his aesthetic--one often identified as the pinnacle of New York comics. The stories in <em>Contract with God</em> are not Eisner's but told through Eisner who fills in the aesthetic details and renders the overheard narratives tangible.</p>

<p>Indeed, every non-superhero graphic narrative we have dealt with so far works its narrative through memory and revelation (the detective narrative): <em>Fun Home: A Family Tragicomedy</em> and <em>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth</em>. The analysis gets a little more complicated when we	move to investigate graphic narratives involving superheroes. Given that superhero narratives are not have--at their base--the biographical influence of the graphic novels discussed above, it might seem less relevant to examine the role of temporality in the narrative. However, as mentioned above, given the medium's roots in science fiction, its reliance on narratives of the past and particularly the structures of mythology demands attention.</p>

<p>Any mention of graphic narrative and mythology calls to mind Umberto Eco’s essay "The Myth of Superman." It's worth noting how his theoretical approach to understanding Superman's temporality confirms the overwhelming presence of the past in the structures the underlie the medium. Speaking to Superman’s dual identity as both "mild-mannered" Clark Kent and Superman, Eco notes that "In terms of narrative, Superman's double identity has a function since it permits the suspense characteristic of a detective story and great variation in the mode of narrating our hero's adventures, his ambiguities, his histrionics" (Eco 15). In other words, we can delve into the back-stories of two characters, who nonetheless share the same body. The medium--particularly in the superhero genre’s dual identity structures--relies on a narrative that fills in the details of a character’s past.</p>

<p>Continuing his line of analysis, Eco argues that "Such a character will take on what we will call an 'aesthetic universality,' a capacity to serve as a reference point for behaviour and feelings which belong to us all. He does not contain the universality of myth, nor does he become an	archetype, the emblem of a supernatural reality. He is the result of a universal rendering of a particular and eternal event. The character of a novel is a 'historic type.' Therefore, to accommodate this character, the aesthetics of the novel must revive an old category particularly necessary when art abandons the territory of myth; this we may term the 'typical'" (Eco 15). Eco’s nod to the "typical" here calls to mind the overwhelming "typicalness" of characters such as Jimmy Corrigan who, while toying radically with the tropes of the superhero narrative, nevertheless feature individuals who are more typical than heroic, more wrapped in their past than in their present. In short, because the superhero narrative does not provide a archetypal or mythological model for the medium, creativity can	focus on the typical or, more precisely, the mythology of the typical wherein readers are directed to journey while the lives of typical individuals are revealed through a structure more responsive to the transmutable identities (often secret) of superheroes. Gone is the mythological hero who arrives fully formed as a model for the Just life, and whose adventures serve	to reinforce his moral justness. In its place is the empty shell of a typical individual whose identity is revealed through the gradual revelation of minutiae which may or may not justify that individual’s reason for being.</p>

<p>Furthermore, "The mythological character of comic strips finds himself in this singular situation: he must be an archetype, the totality of certain collective aspirations, and therefore, he must necessarily become immobilized in an emblematic and fixed nature which renders him easily recognizable (this is what happens to Superman); but since he is marketed in the sphere of a ‘romantic’ production for a public that consumes 'romances,' he must be subjected to a development which is typical, as we have seen, of novelistic characters" (Eco 15). The characters and narratives of the graphic narrative are therefore representative of our "collective aspirations"--that we all possess the potential to be Superman, or the potential to examine our pasts with the insight of someone like Bechdel--but fixed within a fairly simplistic revelatory structure that involves the constant "filling in" of missing details.</p>

<p>In his explanation of this structure of character and narrative development, Eco argues that "Superman's script writers have devised a solution which is much shrewder and undoubtedly more original. The stories develop in a kind of oneiric climate--of which the reader is not aware at all--where what has happened before and what has happened after appears extremely hazy. The narrator picks up the strand of the event again and again as if he had forgotten to say something and wanted to add details to what had already been said" (Eco 17). Indeed, the lazy critic of the graphic narrative could quickly offer that every story in the medium is essentially a retelling of a genesis narrative, one that has its roots in the historical structures of Western story-telling. However, Eco's continued analysis provides insight into how we might interpret the overwhelming presence of historiography in the graphic narrative: <blockquote>It occurs, then, that along with Superman stories, Superboy stories are told, that is, stories of Superman when he was a boy, or a tiny child under the name of Superbaby. At a certain point, Supergirl appears on the scene. She is Superman's cousin and she, too, escaped from the destruction of Krypton. All of the events concerning Superman are retold in one way or another in order to account for the presence of this new character (who has hitherto not been mentioned, because, it is explained, she has lived in disguise in a girls' school, awaiting puberty, at which time she could come out into the world; the narrator goes back in time to tell in how many and in which cases she, of whom nothing was said, participated during those many adventures where we saw Superman alone involved). One imagines, using the solution of travel through time, that Supergirl, Superman's contemporary, can encounter Superboy in the past and be his playmate; and even Superboy, having broken the time barrier by sheer accident, can encounter Superman, his own self of many years later. (Eco 17)</blockquote> In other words, the true power of the medium is how open it is to retelling and renewal. While the scaffolding may be similar, the aesthetics consistently rework external	appearances--an apt way of understanding the dual identities at work in the Superhero who is both “super” and "typical"; "surface" and "secret." As Eco concludes, "In Superman stories the time that breaks down is the time of the story, that is, the notion of time which ties one episode to another. In the sphere of a story, Superman accomplishes a given job (he routs a band of gangsters); at this point the story ends. In the same comic book, or in the edition of the following week, a new story begins" (Eco 17). Indeed, it may well be that the episodic foundations of the medium encourage an aesthetics that revisits and reconsiders its subject-matter. At the same time, however, the medium is acutely aware of its own repetitive tendencies, and its aesthetics, structures, tropes, and characters continually offer a self-referential glance at the medium’s limits. In fact, the vast majority of the successful graphic narratives delve headlong into the limits of representation, particularly if that representation entails the repeated revelation of secret identities, or narrative histories. The strength is not necessarily in the originality of the tale, but in the originality of the re-telling. Far from being forward-thinking or metaphoric of technological or scientific anxieties, the supernatural	characteristics of the medium’s characters and narratives are merely smokescreens for the aesthetics of re-telling, merely ways of manipulating echoes from the past. The story has already been told, it’s the details we’re interested in exploring and it’s the details that receive the most direct aesthetic attention.</p>

<p>Even a character like Sherlock Holmes, a man of details and supernatural cranial powers, has his stories told through the after-the-fact reportage of Watson, who bears out the revelator process, the conclusion to which, he already knows.</p>

<p>In the end, what gets revealed are not the superpowers or the moralfortitude, but the slow revelation of the superhero's character flushed out by trips back in time, through the consistent re-telling of stories told, and the ever-present after-the-fact reportage. A typical character shows us a typical story of a typical event in an extraordinary way. In comic books, despite the super-natural, super-mechanical, or super-atomic causations, everything has already happened. All that's left is to reveal the unlimited intricacies of character, or to embellish the narrative.</p>
