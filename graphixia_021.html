<p>While Spider-man is now a household name, few recognize what a significant upset he was to the comics industry during the early 1960s – the immediate popularity of his character signified a shift in the way comics would be thought of in terms of their demographics and realized what the industry had been attempting to achieve for decades prior: a readership who identified with the protagonist. Superhero comics, at their core, are about establishing fictional agency over events that are outside of one’s control – the Golden Age of comics, generally acknowledged to have started with <em>Action Comics #1</em> in 1938, saw heroes battling the forces of social oppression through archetypal figures of organized crime in often nameless mob leaders, advancing technologies in mad scientists, and later ideologically though the key figures of the Second World War as openly displayed in Captain America knocking out Hitler, Batman passing needed weapons to soldiers or, as the cover of <em>Action Comics #58</em> shows, Superman hand printing posters which told America that “Superman says you can slap a Jap with war bonds and stamps.”</p>

<p>These figures of the Golden age addressed extremely varied but pressing social and ideological concerns of their day (often in problematic ways), but they were consistent in at least one aspect: they presented predominantly adult heroes who were confident and secure, dealing with the metonymic representations of social ills handily and definitively. DC Comics dominated the marketplace, and while there were variations in costumes and powers, that the hero was an adult remained a constant for decades; children and teen characters of the Golden Age, when appearing at all, were given subordinate positions, as seen most famously in Batman’s Robin and Captain America’s Bucky.</p>
			
<p>As comics during this era were intended predominantly for children and adolescents, some have argued that the solely adult hero was a product of poor marketing; others have claimed that superhero comics were mired in the traditions of the dimestore novels that preceded them, refusing to acknowledge that the new medium for these stories demanded a different approach in their telling. What is more likely is that these comics were being marketed to the adults who ultimately would purchase them for their children, on topics that spoke to those with buying power and addressing water-cooler concerns of the day. What concerned this audience were the larger social and political issues of the day. When Spider-man erupted in 1962, his presence was a dramatic shift away from these ideological and social interests to focus more squarely on the teenager and the plight of the individual – a protagonist who was, for the first time, reflective of the actual age of superhero comics’ readers.</p>

<p>Stan Lee’s vision for Spider-man in this regard was unwavering – he demanded, to the protests of his senior editor, that his hero be an unexceptional teen and not, as were the common tropes, a billionaire, an alien or a trained soldier. Lee prognosticated what few others realized about superhero comics at the time: those who are attracted to the agency that superhero comics promote are drawn to it in more practical, tangible ways than through ideologically-based conflicts. Villains such as the mad doctor Hugo Strange, Hitler’s protégé Red Skull or billionaire madman Lex Luthor, while compelling, are hardly accessible to the adolescent (or even truly the adult) reader – while one can celebrate in the chosen hero’s triumph over the capitalistic power of Luthor or the fascism of Red Skull, these victories do not provide entry in such a way as to allow readers to identify with the application of this agency in their own lives, again being the cornerstone of the superhero genre as a whole.</p>

<p>Tellingly, Spider-man’s introduction prompted a title change from Amazing Adult Fantasy to Amazing Fantasy, with his first appearance being in issue #15. Though the cover addressed the trope of the adult archetypal hero, being arguably a swipe of Batman’s first appearance in <em>Detective Comics #27</em>, and was again marketed to the parent who had purchasing power, the content was radically different from what the industry had seen to this point. Peter Parker was a bullied teenager, orphaned and in the care of an elderly aunt and uncle, and required tangible control over his personal circumstances in a way that was both pointed and realistic – indeed, his first act on receiving his powers from a radioactive spider bite was to enter a wrestling contest in pursuit of a cash prize. Unlike his predecessors, Spider-man does not live in a world of moral binaries, and while standing for good, his reaction is not that of a cultural signifier but of an individual youth.</p>

<p>This shift in how comics understood the demands of its readership – agency of the individual, not of society on the whole – is now a common facet of the comics industry. Amazing Fantasy #15, though at first considered a long shot, was Marvel’s best selling single issue to that point in the company’s history and prompted the introduction of more teenage characters who, though imbued with various powers, all had personal problems as well that were addressed in the background of super-villain battles. The X-Men, the first teenaged team, were launched late in the year following Spider-man’s introduction and became another highly successful title for the company. DC comics was slower to follow suit, being placed in the problematic position of having long-established adult characters – they opted for slapstick situations and storylines during the Silver Age involving these household names, and it is likely because of this ineffective approach at garnering teenage readers that Marvel, with its growing host of new, adolescent characters who could be more easily identified with, quickly gained market dominance. By the advent of Spider-man, DC’s Superman and Batman were already cultural memes and there was little that could be done to reconcile this fact with the shifting market.</p>

<p>The introduction of Spider-man to the world of comics represented a paradigm shift in the way that the superhero was constructed – his success meant the creation of characters who were more easily identified with, who had relatable problems and who had struggles of conscience in dealing with their real life concerns. Prior to Spider-man, agency was left in the capable hands of the superhero who would right wrongs and provide confidence in the reader that justice would be served on a larger scale – Spider-man, however, shifted this perspective to show that agency lies more potently within the individual, that anyone - regardless of circumstances - can become a hero in his or her own life, and cautioned us that with this “great power comes great responsibility.”</p>
