<p>A conversation between me and fellow Graphixia writer <a href="http://twitter.com/wilkinspeter">@wilkinspeter</a>:</p>

<p>So I started off my Adventures with Tintin (see what I did there?) feeling very very very confused and largely irritable. This wasn't my first foray into Tintin; I read through them all when I was a kid because our public library had the whole set and because he seemed pretty neat.  But when you're 10, your suspension of disbelief is not only willing, but joyful.  You don't need a lot of back story to be satisfied with the plot as it unfolds.  Because Tintin doesn't offer a lot of backstory. People are chasing him... because they are.  He's a journalist... who never puts pen to paper.  He seems to be in constant peril and yet never comes to harm.  But why?  I kept asking myself as I moved through title after title: what is going on, and why is it happening?</p>

<p>Then I came to a startling realization that I was a victim of my own expectations of genre.  Because of the way the books look, the set up of Tintin as an ordinary, unassuming reporter, the adventure narratives and the real life (if filtered) scenarios, I was expecting if not a slice-of-life comic, then something of a straightforward realist narrative.  Such stories usually offer rich backstory and straightforward cause and effect.  (Except when they don't.)  But that's not what Tintin is.</p>

<p>Tintin is a superhero, and these books are superhero comics.</p>

<p>Slide into some tights and I'll explain.</p>

<p>You know what you never really expect of a superhero story?  Rationality and explanation.  Superhero stories mostly just get to be what they are.  Really?  A radioactive spider?  Okay! You're from the Planet Krypton?  Sure!  You can fly?  Why not? In fact, that question is the central difference between a	superhero comic and a realist narrative; when we read texts with the expectation that they exist in our world and function by our rules, we ask why.  When we read a superhero comic, we ask why not.</p>

<p>There are lots of things that make Tintin a superhero. <ul> <li>sidekick (Snowy) who provides comic relief and gets him into and out of scrapes</li> <li>invincibility (seriously, nothing kills this guy)</li> <li>a mild-mannered outward appearance (though not a secret identity)</li> <li>a job -- reporter -- that he NEVER EVER DOES</li> <li>strength, cunning, and honour</li> <li>an excellent lead hook</li> </ul> Once upon a time, Chris Sims created <a href="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.comicsalliance.com/media/2010/05/periodictable-2.jpg">the Elements of a Superhero</a>, and I think there's an argument to be made that Tintin embodies elements 1, 4, 7, 11, 29, 30, 45, 47, 54, and 71.  For example...</p>

<p>Invincibility (with superheroic sound effects!):</p>

<p>Also, the comical black-and-white nature of good and evil in the villains echo those of Jack Kirby-era comics:</p>

<p>And the amazingly unperilous peril (seriously, there is at least one panel like this one in every Tintin comic ever):</p>

<p>(don't worry too much -- he figures it out EVERY SINGLE TIME)</p>

<p>See, when I was reading the comics as even vague representations of realism, they were infuriating.  Once I accepted that Tintin is a superhero, and thus the laws applying to you and I do not apply to him, I was able to relax into the ridiculous scenarios and enjoy the ride.  He has to be a superhero for the framing and conceit to work.</p>

<p>This is the power of the expectations we have around genre, and a reminder of how much the assumptions we bring to a text shape our understanding of it.<p>

<P>But I still think Tintin should wear tights.</P>
