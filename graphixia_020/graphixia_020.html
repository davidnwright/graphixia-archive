<p>Villainy in the early <em>Spiderman</em> is a double phenomenon, as the quotidian nemeses of Spiderman and Peter Parker, who appear in every issue, contrast with the “super” villains, who are specific to particular issues, though they frequently make repeat appearances. This contrast testifies to the fact that Spiderman, and perhaps every super hero comic, works in two registers that overlap each other but are in fact quite distinct. The frequent split-face frames in which half the face is Peter Parker’s face and the other half is Spiderman’s mask signal the double world of the comic: the world of the “symbolic order” and the world of the “imaginary”. In the world of the symbolic order all normal social rules apply; teenagers must go to high-school and take their place in the gendered pecking order. The world of the imaginary, however, is one where radioactive spider bites allow a hero to swing from building to building with the help of a web shooter and confront villains as outlandishly origined and costumed as he is.</p>

<p>The everyday enemies triangulate with Peter Parker and Spiderman in such a way that demonstrates the separation of worlds. J Jonah Jameson has a near hysterical hatred of Spiderman and yet he employs Peter Parker at The Daily Bugle as a photographer. Readers get a taste of dramatic irony in our knowledge that Parker and Spiderman are the same person; we see the relationship between worlds that Jameson does not. For Jameson, the world of the imaginary that contains Spiderman is always “out there” as Spiderman eludes all his efforts to stamp him out. No matter what good Spiderman achieves, even when he saves Jameson’s astronaut son in issue #2, Jameson persists in his hatred. Just as Spiderman is a typical teenager, Jameson is a standard middle-aged father figure as he might appear to teenage eyes: irrationally critical, impossible to satisfy, and full of prejudice. What we have here may be an early 60s prototype of “The Man,” who later in the decade will represent everything retrograde in Amercian society. For the moment, however, Jameson is an enemy of the whole concept of the super hero.</p>

<p>Flash Thompson, meanwhile, is the sign of all that is oppressive about Peter Parker’s teenagehood, especially the fact that he must keep his super powers secret. Thompson bullies Parker relentlessly and stereotypically, reminding us of how much Parker represents the desire of the typical comic book reader, the desire of the “intellectual” bookworm to become “physical” hero. And yet, Thompson is smitten with Spiderman, always willing to defend him against Jameson’s suggestions in The Bugle. Like Jameson, Thompson points to the separation of symbolic and imaginary worlds, when Peter Parker sets him up to be Spiderman’s alter ego in issue #8.</p>

<p>After all, it’s more likely that the athletic, muscular Thompson be Spiderman than the four-eyed science geek. Indeed, when Dr Octopus unmasks Spiderman to reveal Peter Parker in issue #12, no one believes the revelation. Parker must have been “dressing up” as Spiderman. The inhabitants of the symbolic order will not permit the imaginary world of the super hero to link up with it in this way. Again, Spiderman must exist beyond the symbolic order.</p>

<p>As simplistic as early <em>Spiderman</em> is, it carefully keeps the imaginary world distinct from everyday reality, allowing our minds to function in two perceptual frameworks that the destiny of super hero comics, in the form of <em>Watchmen</em>, will asymptotically try to bring together.</p>
