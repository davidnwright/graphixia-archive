<p>So far, my posts on superhero comics have focused on the relationship between alternate worlds, the way the “imaginary” register of the hero, with his or her powers and nemeses, relates to the “symbolic” register of quotidian reality.  Superhero comics are often governed by a plausibility principle, the need to explain or justify what happens in the imaginary register to the symbolic register. Early Spider-Man in particular possesses a strong plausibility principle: Peter Parker is a “genuine” teenager with “genuine” teenage problems. He must live in the symbolic register even as he performs heroic feats as Spider-Man in the imaginary one. Sexuality is of course fundamental to the condition of the genuine teenager[1].  In the early Spider-Man, Peter’s problems with sexual relationships invoke further divisions between worlds, specifically, the worlds of work and high school, and by implication, the worlds of adulthood and childhood. The tension between these worlds is just as fraught as that between the world of the superhero and the world of everyday life.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the love interest is a problem for the male superhero because he always faces the question of whether his girlfriend might discover his identity and out him. Furthermore, the hero faces the temptation to reveal himself; after all, the possession of super powers is a powerful secondary sexual characteristic.  Because the hero’s alter ego appears to be an unacceptable object choice, the revelation of these powers promises sexual success.</p>

<p>Jonathan Lethem's <em>Fortress of Solitude</em> offers a	comic version of hero’s revelatory dilemma. Dylan Ebdus leaves his home in Brooklyn to spend a summer in Vermont as a "Fresh Air Kid." At the end of the summer, he decides to reveal his “true” identity as the superhero Aeroman to Heather, the daughter of the family he is staying with, a girl with whom he has a budding romantic relationship. The purpose of the revelation is to seal the deal on the relationship.  The moment is awkward because in the symbolic order, such a revelation is embarassing; just as Dylan is entering the adult world of sexuality, he exposes the childish world of his imagination (even though he really can fly!).  What would be a moment of triumph becomes one of failure because of Dylan’s inability to obey the principle of the separation of worlds.  This principle has broken down as superhero comics have tried to engage more with the world of “reality” in more recent years, but in the early Spider-Man, the principle remains firm. Peter Parker cannot reveal himself as Spider-Man to either Liz Allan or Betty Brant, the two women who both provide the love interest and represent the quotidian world where one has no special powers, a world in which one must toil away at work or school just like everyone else.</p>

<p>Peter Parker’s love triangle with Betty and Liz, along with his caring for Aunt May and his bullying at the hands of Flash Thompson make up his matrix of reality, the daily concerns that prove that he is an actual person with whom the reader can identify and not just a spider-bitten freak. His circumstances--he must look after his ailing Aunt May--force him into an accelerated transition from the world of childhood into that of adult responsibility. Indeed, “With great power comes great responsibility” might as well be the slogan for being a grown up as well as being a super hero. Meanwhile, Peter’s schoolmates enjoy a carefree teenage life that Liz Allan is fully part of. Initially, she taunts Peter with all the other kids. And because she is Flash Thompson’s girlfriend, she represents the world of social acceptability and the sexual partnering that goes with it, a world from which Peter is excluded because he is a science nerd. He wears big glasses, a yellow waistcoat or sweater vest, and focuses entirely on his studies.</p>

<p>But, as he comes to grips with his new powers, Peter begins to gain confidence and attraction in the social world. He begins his transformation in issue #8, in which he has a boxing match with Flash Thompson. Early in the comic, Flash gives Peter a push and breaks his glasses. He never wears them again.</p>

<p>His clothes begin to change as well. The yellow sweater vest gives way to a a more neutral colour in issue #9.  At the same time, Liz begins to realize the limitations in Flash as an object choice--he is a dumb jock, after all--and becomes interested in Peter, who, without glasses, looks less like a teenaged Clark Kent.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Betty Brant, who is J Jonah Jameson’s secretary, undergoes a transformation from a maternal figure to a potential romantic partner for Peter.  As her hair changes from curly perm to a younger-looking bob, we find that she too is of high school age and that she has had to leave school and enter the work force because of her brother’s gambling debts. Her entry into the world of responsibility echoes Peter’s, but she has been more severely split from the high school world. So it is not surprising that she is jealous of Liz Allan, who threatens to pull Peter back to the world she has been shut out of.</p>

<p>When Betty gets jealous of Liz, it's a sign that Peter Parker has difficulty holding all of his worlds in  place, keeping them separate [2]. <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em> is a world of binaries, Spider-Man/Peter Parker; Adult/Child; Work/School; even Blond/Brunette. The manichean universe of the super hero comic operates through the continual transgression and reinforcement of the boundary between the terms that repeats what happens with the boundary between the imaginary and the symbolic.</p>

<p>The destinies of Betty and Liz in the Spider-man story arc show that once a character is in a super-hero comic book, he or she will not only persist through a multitude of permutations, but that that character will be dragged into the imaginary register from the symbolic one.  Liz Allan’s step brother is Molten Man, and she marries Harry Osborne, who becomes the Green Goblin. Betty Brant marries Ned Leeds, who ends up being brainwashed into being the Hobgoblin. Peter Parker’s spider bite does not simply transform him, but the world around him and the people in it as well.  The imaginary register thus infects the symbolic and the division of worlds that sustains the heroic universe is difficult to maintain. Transgressing the boundary between the imaginary and symbolic registers is what makes the story interesting. But if the boundary dissolves altogether, the story loses all substance and tension.</p>

<p>[1] One wonders why more superheros aren’t like Tintin, who never troubles himself with girls or boys in a romantic or sexual way.</p>

<p>[2] That Liz and Betty are both variants of Elizabeth stresses the link between them.</p>
