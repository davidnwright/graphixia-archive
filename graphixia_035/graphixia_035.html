<p>having noted the plethora of negative reviews both for the storyline and directing, I’m taking it upon myself to write a defense of the source material – no better time to do it, really, as judging by the movie’s box office gross, it doesn’t appear likely that there will be a sequel. The central concern that most reviewers seem to have is that the movie is too outlandish, the characters are too colourful, the world that the film creates is too unrealistic to invite the mainstay viewer in to participate in the storyline. Loosely translated, the main criticism is that the film comes off as too much like a comic book. Given the success of other recent comic- based films, what is it about Green Lantern that made it fail? It was generally quite faithful to the source material, the acting (while not superb) carried the dialogue, the special effects made the Green Lantern homeworld of Oa spectacular to behold – it truly had all the makings of a successful film. Perhaps the larger question here is, why are some comics easily translatable to winning films while others are clearly not? We can be reminded here of Alan Moore’s prophesy that his much lauded Watchmen was “unfilimable” and that he refused to be involved in the rendering of his story into film, a prognostication that, despite Zack Snyder’s fanatic adherence to the source material, turned out to be quite correct (at least, again, in most critics’ eyes). Green Lantern now has faced a similar problem, having transitioned into a medium that it was never originally conceived for.</p>

<p>The history of Green Lantern is incredibly rich and, unlike many of the modern characters who are now enjoying silver screen fame (like Thor, Iron Man and Spider-man) dates back to the Golden Age of comics. The original Green Lantern, Alan Scott, who first appeared very shortly after Superman and Batman in All-American Comics #16 in July of 1940, used a magic lantern fashioned out of a meteorite to fight crime – his adventures were, like the other heroes of the time, based on the dime-store detective fiction of the previous decade with the twist of costumes and powers, and the crimes that he fought against were entirely terrestrial in nature. The character received his own title and moderate popularity, but he was ultimately unsuccessful and did not survive into the Silver Age (though in the Modern Age he has since been rebooted and is currently a member of the Justice Society of America).</p>

<p>the start of the Silver Age, DC decided to revamp Green Lantern in an entirely different direction. Crafted by Gil Kane, Hal Jordan, making his first appearance in Showcase #22 in October 1959, was the recipient of a ring from an alien named Abin Sur (for those who have seen the film, the basic origin plot is generally the same in this first issue). Oa and the development of the Green Lantern Corps, however, are only hinted at in these first few appearances in Showcase, with the character developing more slowly than what we see in Spider-man and Superman, for example – the Guardians do not appear until the character received his own series, despite having made contact with him in Showcase #23, and the rest of the Corps only came into being as the character’s solo title progressed.</p>

<p>Much like in the Golden Age, the Silver Age Green Lantern was not a popular character, and his title came very close to cancellation – it had transitioned to a general science-fiction title, and its artists were generally subpar compared to DC’s other then-current titles. This prompted the editors of DC to hand the character over to Denny O’Neil and Neal Adams in a last ditch attempt to save the title. Often considered the start of the Bronze Age of comics, the duo’s run on the title (beginning with issue #76) brought the</p>

<p>character back to Earth and had Green Lantern wrestling with complex social issues for what is arguably the first time in comics’ history to that point. Green Lantern, paired with Green Arrow for the run, faced problems like racism, religious fanaticism, the pervasiveness of media, the destructive nature of capitalism and even Green Arrow’s sidekick, Speedy, wrestling with heroin addiction. The contrast here to the Green Lantern invested in the politics of Oa and space adventures is almost as great a contrast as Alan Scott was to Hal Jordan – here, we are presented with a socially conscious character that is fully grounded in the problems of his own world, ushering the comics’ reader into thinking more diversely during their reading experience. Scholars have since pointed to the run as being a sea-change in the way that comics were conceived, acknowledging that for the first time the medium was acknowledged as being able to carry explicitly complex, value laden original stories, integrating complex moral struggles with elements of the fantastic.</p>

<p>O’Neil and Adams’ run on Green Lantern was short, lasting only until issue #89; the title went on hiatus directly after, and it did not see publication again until 1977. From here, we once again encounter the outer space exploits with the universe that Green Lantern operates in becoming incredibly diverse and filled with a multitude of alien species, interstellar wars and the complex workings of the Green Lantern Corps itself – beyond this, for consistency and relevance to the publishing line as a whole, Hal Jordan interacted with the mainstay characters of the DCU on a semi-regular basis, being a member of the Justice League and appearing in others’ solo titles as well. Green Lantern was eventually retitled Green Lantern Corps, cancelled and rebooted again as Green Lantern #1 in 1989, a series which ran for 181 issues. During this time, we have been introduced to many other Green Lanterns, including Kyle Rayner, Guy Gardner and John Stewart, each of whom many readers identify as their “favorite.” It has since been restarted by Geoff Johns with Green Lantern: Rebirth and, because of the author’s highly innovative reworking of Green Lantern history in regards to the emotional colour spectrum of the power rings and the expansion of the Green Lantern universe as a whole, the character is now one of DC’s “A-Listers,” sometimes outselling long-standing titles like Action and Detective. The most recent DC company-wide events have been based on the character, being Blackest Night and the Sinestro Corps War, and the three current Green Lantern titles are consistently in the ranks of DC’s top selling books.</p>

<p>We’ve written before here about the fact that the comic world can often be ostracizing to the outsider; this is ironic, as the titles and characters often speak to the disenfranchised with the fantastic stories of power and control over one’s environment, offering an out for the Sartrean suffering that comes from negative events that occur outside of our personal spheres (though this could really be the allure of fictional worlds in general). With characters like Green Lantern, the reader is not addressing a platonic archetype as he is in Superman, Batman and Spider-man; as my far from comprehensive outlining of Green Lantern’s history shows, we have a character who has seen many different incarnations over several decades of writers, operating in as complex and nuanced a universe as comicdom offers. The appeal of Green Lantern and the current success of his title stems from this experienced evolution of his character and his environment, with readers drawn into the highly detailed and closely read world of multiple authors’ imaginings – it is not so much the character himself who is successful (Hal Jordan wasn't even Earth’s Green Lantern for most of the 90’s) but the larger scope of the rich mosaic of storyarcs that have led to his current incarnation. One could argue that DC took a misstep in failing to recognize this, that archetypal characters are always those that are most successful because they can be related more easily to events off of the screen. Green Lantern achieved prominence in the superhero genre while operating outside of this dictum, taking many years to become popular and only when his personal universe developed a consistency and depth that most other heroes are never challenged by. While one could certainly argue (as I have myself) that all of the characters who have lived through the Golden Age to present are multiauthored constructions that are dynamic and shifting, demanding close reading to develop a full understanding of their characters, none are so dependent upon this type of reading as Green Lantern. This image below can give you an idea of the expansiveness of the universe that has been created in the many Green Lantern series over the decades:</p>

<p>Film demands certain traits of its comic book franchises – there must be a comprehensive origin story, a relatable character, a self contained plot and a world that is fully explained through the lens of the reality in which we normally operate (we can see this even in Marvel’s recent Thor, where the Asgardian God was explained away as being a potential alien, his rainbow from the heavens being an Einstein-Rosen bridge). In short, comic book movies are expected to not be comic book movies; instead of acknowledging the complex histories of the characters they address and incorporating a copious dependence on suspension of reality, they anticipate no foreknowledge of the character and attempt to offer condensed versions of characters for single-serving consumption. Again, while this is acceptable for archetypes, Green Lantern is not this kind of character. He is, instead, a very “comic-book” character who relies on readers who have not only familiarized themselves with the details of his universe but who have come to accept him, over time, for all the conflicts his reality has with our own. Attempting to condense this kind of history into a single package could not help but be unsuccessful as, returning to Watchmen, Alan Moore knew about his own work. In a similar way, Watchmen relied on the close reading of its audience in relation to the superhero genre as a whole – his work was successful because it mocked superhero archetypes by humanizing and thereby corrupting them, requiring this familiarity in order to carry the breadth of its message. Green Lantern, and the other characters like him (though they are few), similarly demands a perspective that is familiar with the way that comics operate as a running saga that is complex and varied, that is not immediately consumable and dispensed with. When the movie attempts to collapse this history and turn the richness of the Green Lantern Universe into a single two hour film, it does a disservice to what made Green Lantern an asset to the DCU in the first place. The reviews that state that the movie is too much like a comic book are indeed accurate and are telling in that they highlight the fact that certain titles in the medium do have an essential element that make them successful here and nowhere else. The stories and histories of Green Lantern are worth reading because of their complexity, and perhaps the relative failure of the film that unsuccessfully attempted to condense this dynamic and continuously evolving space only serves to emphasize the positive qualities of the character in his original home.</p>
