<p>As we’ve seen these past few weeks in Graphixia, memory plays multiple roles in the shaping of comics’ narratives, operating on many levels both for the characters as well as for the mainstay readers of comics themselves. The detailed histories presented in long-running serials present challenges for the authors in ensuring accuracy, offer avenues to reinvent characters in innovative ways that are compelling precisely because they defy expectation and standardization, and are played upon in order to highlight the import of certain events through editorial commentary to build upon stories or negate others in order to pursue a static, unchanging representation of the superhero archetype. The multiple functions of memory create overwhelmingly diverse ways in which comics can be both written and read, making long-running comics compelling both for the casual reader as well as the literary critic alike.</p>

<p>Jason Aaron’s very recent (and still running, for one more issue at least) PunisherMax exploits this multiple use of memory in highly innovative and intriguing ways, playing against readers’ expectations and reshaping a long-standing Marvel character to reinvigorate him for a new generation that has greater expectations of comics as a more literary genre. This series, begun in January of 2010, rebooted Punisher under Marvel’s “Max” imprint – much like DC’s “Elseworlds,” creators here are given free rein to rework, reestablish and reinvent characters as they see fit, with the added incentive of not having to adhere to any sort of established comics’ code. As a result, these Max comics (earmarked for adults only) are often rife with graphic violence, sexuality and expressly adult themes; while these features may not be positives for many readers, they do allow for a diverse range of authors whose talents would not otherwise be used to full advantage in more mainstream comics writing, such as Warren Ellis, and darker, more adult tales from fan (and critic) favorites Straczynski and Bendis. Aaron’s work on Punisher, gritty and explicit, certainly belongs under the Max imprint, his stories becoming all the more gripping and memorable because of their gratuitous nature.</p>

<p>The Punisher as a character is an exemplar of how memory motivates heroes and compels them to action. Like many others, Punisher (aka Frank Castle) is haunted by the death of his family, who in his case were gunned down in a public park during a sunny afternoon picnic – he himself survived the attack, which led him to pursue vengeance on all criminals who would do the same to others. He is not, however, only haunted by the memory of the death of his family; Castle is also an ex-Marine, shell-shocked and distraught from the legalized atrocities he both witnessed and performed as a soldier during the Vietnam War. Different authors who have handled Punisher in the past have treated these as separate motivators, with Castle being either vengeful at the death of his wife and children, or a disgruntled soldier who has returned with a compulsion to exact vengeance on wrongdoing through the methods that his government has legitimized in a wartime environment. Aaron, however, condenses these perspectives and plays to both, integrating them to come up with a more comprehensive – and far more complex – vision of what drives the Punisher. He co-ordinates this reinvestigation of Castle’s character through reworking his nemeses’ pasts while reintroducing them for a new audience, making their pasts his own.</p>

<p>PunisherMax begins in medias res, with Castle having already established himself as a counterforce against his city’s criminal element, having been in operation for some thirty years. Presented as an old man nearing the end of his run as a hero, Castle is slipping up and making mistakes, leaving witnesses behind and not ensuring that all of his criminal targets have been killed. Here is where Aaron introduces his once-familiar nemeses, presented in this Max universe for the first time as new threats that the wizened Castle must deal with. The first arc, “Kingpin,” shows Wilson Fisk’s introduction and rise as the crime boss of Castle’s city. Aaron explores Fisk’s history by oscillating between past and present, with no familiar acknowledgement that he’s indicating a flashback – the effect is jolting to the reader who is left with the implication that the past so informs the present that no editorial box indicating the shift is necessary. Over the course of the five issue arc, Fisk’s story parallel’s Castle’s, even in the way that the panels are constructed:</p>

<p>This construction has the dual effect of showing the characters’ similar paths and motivations, both born in violence and taking their city by force, and foreshadowing a similar narrative structure for Castle’s own explorative arc later in the series. We are left at the end of this five issue introduction with a Kingpin who has risen to the top of the city’s criminal empire through manipulation, violence, deceit and, importantly, the sacrifice of his family – when his son is taken hostage by the crime boss Fisk is designing to replace, he apologizes to the boy and allows him to die so his own career as Kingpin can begin. Fisk and Castle are here set up as dual sides of the same persona and motivators, a fact that Aaron explores more fully in subsequent arcs.</p>

<p>The second arc, being “Bullseye,” reintroduces another of Castle’s nemeses – the titular character having been hired by Fisk to eliminate Castle. While the reader expects immediate action, however, we are forced to wait for several issues for it to occur; Bullseye, despite clearly being portrayed as a violent psychopath, studies Castle’s motivations and personal history in order to find a flaw through which he can end his life. The reader explores this past with Bullseye, and the importance of memory as motivation becomes far more salient as the arc progresses. Bullseye conducts torturous “interviews” with the only prompt being “tell me what Castle is like,” and he sleeps on the graves of Castle’s murdered family in order to try to understand his character. Bullseye goes so far as to attempt to relive the traumatic event of Castle’s family being killed in the park by kidnapping a similar family, forcing them to play along as he assumes the role of “loving” father, and then having them executed in the same setting in an attempt to replicate the event and feel the same compelling motivation for vengeance. All of these attempts fail, however, and Bullseye comes to the same realization that a hero cannot, as is commonly assumed, be explained away by a singular event as many other popular comics would have us believe:</p>

<p>This skewing of the normal approach of pigeonholing a hero by a single motivator is further highlighted by Castle himself. Discussing his next plan of attack, he interrupts his own conversation with an acknowledgement of his own failing memory:</p>

<p>[picture: punishermemory_04.jpg]</p>

<p>The reader now sees how complex memory is as a motivator – we are left with a convoluted vision of what drives characterization and how challenging it can be to reconcile our actions with even the events that we feel have shaped our own lives, let alone how challenging it is for others to define us by our pasts. Bullseye ultimately becomes near comatose for an entire issue of the arc while attempting to rationalize Castle’s convictions, struggling (verbally, for the reader’s benefit) with his character but metatextually also with the apparently irreconcilable ways that Punisher has been presented by past authors: if Punisher was born in the bloodied jungles of Vietnam, why could he not detect a trap set for his family in a city park and thereby save them? Aaron here toys with memory on two fronts, making readers question not only Castle’s impetus for action, but the illogical and simplistic way that we have understood him in the past.</p>

<p>The final confrontation at the end of the arc sees Bullseye having uncovered the “truth” about Castle, summed up in his family’s final day at the park and what Castle said to his wife and children right before they were murdered. Bullseye assumes that there must have been some significant distraction to cause Castle to fail to recognize the danger he was in and, with a hand at his throat, Bullseye reveals the correct answer to the question of what was going through Castle’s mind on the day of the tragedy. Aaron leaves this to the reader’s imagination, however, making the dialogue balloon too small for us to see – we acknowledge the wide eyes of the startled Punisher on realizing that some horrible truth has been uncovered, but we are not privy to this information. Even after the buildup to this final confrontation, to sum up Castle’s character in a single line is still too easy a response for Aaron (and too easy a response for his readers). Instead, he uses this single unreadable balloon as the impetus for his entire arc to follow, titled “Frank.”</p>

<p>In this penultimate arc for the series, Aaron shows us through the structure of the book just how significant memory is both for comics’ characters themselves as well as for the reading audience. Each issue shifts seamlessly between past and present in exploring Frank Castle’s past, detailing his time in Vietnam and his home life on his return, juxtaposed with the present Castle being stuck in prison. As the arc progresses, more and more pages of each issue are devoted to exploring Castle’s motivations, all leading up to the fateful day in the park and the revelation of Castle’s final words to his wife right before she was killed. By the final issue of the arc, the flashbacks are no longer, strictly speaking, flashbacks: they open the issue and comprise the bulk of its pages, and Castle’s past is where the more interesting of the two stories is contained. The past here supplants the present, and the reader is aware that Castle’s memories are what inform his present to the degree that it is overtaken, the present being only a trivial aftereffect of the complex formative events that made him the hero he has become – when Aaron finally reveals that Castle had told his wife, seconds before her death, that he was leaving her because of his struggles with post-traumatic stress and “pretending [he’s] something [he’s] not,” we not only feel more greatly informed of his motivations in Aaron’s rendition of PunisherMax but are forced to rethink all we know of the Punisher as a character, through every story in which we have ever encountered him. Aaron shows us that Castle is not haunted by an event that occurred <em>to</em> him, either through the Vietnam War or through the murder of his family, but by the memory of a single decision that occurred <em>within</em> him, vocalized only at the last moment of his normal life. He is haunted by his own failure as a father, as a husband and as a soldier who either failed to recognize the imminent attack or, as Aaron subtly implies, allowed it to happen to release him from the bondage of being a workaday family man. He is tormented by the guilt that no reader, until this moment, ever thought that this seemingly black and white character was capable of: on finally admitting the truth of the event, Castle tells the reader against the backdrop of a gruesome flashback of his family’s death, “The thing that haunts me now isn’t the moment they died. The moment my daughter’s belly exploded and my son’s brains came out the back of his head. No, it’s the moment right before that, when I had everything… And I threw it all away. There was a time when I wish I’d died with them that day. But I know the reason I survived. It wasn’t so I could seek revenge in their name. So I could wage my little war.” With the images shifting into the present, he continues, “It was so I could suffer …  A lifetime of punishment ... It will never be enough” (Aaron 16, 7-8). Ultimately, Aaron turns the entire character on his head, in all of his past incarnations, by revealing that the reason that Castle became the Punisher at all was to punish himself. The series concludes, just as Aaron foreshadowed, in the final arc titled “Homeless,” with the Punisher and Kingpin killing each other, neither character ultimately able to come to terms with their irreconcilable past. Castle dies on the steps of his family’s long-abandoned home; even in his final act, he forfeits the present in order to return to his motivations and his guilt over his personal failures. These final panels of PunisherMax vacillate consistently between past and present, leaving the reader unsure as to which story Aaron is more intent on telling.</p>

<p>Though it is difficult to sum up the merits of an entire series in a single post, Aaron’s deft handling of characterization in PunisherMax exemplifies how significant a theme memory can be in understanding comics. In manipulating the memories of both his readers and his characters, Aaron shows us that even the most static, morally rigid heroes can be overwhelmingly complex if provided the right treatment and if we choose to see past archetypal renderings of familiar protagonists. By closely juxtaposing hero and villain, employing flashbacks to an extent rarely seen in mainstream comics and forcing us to see the past as present, he provides a depth to the Punisher that, on rereading, resonates into previous incarnations of the character without conflicting with other authors’ stories. His work on the series is “retconning,” or employing retroactive continuity, at its most impressive: Aaron takes a character who is fueled by memory and exploits this fact to revision the most fundamental attributes of what compels him to action, showing us that memory for a fictional character can be just as complex as it is in the “real” world. In Aaron’s refusal to understand his characters as two dimensional and stock, we are reminded that even superhero archetypes can – and likely should – be approached with the same critical eye with which we address all characters in literature. Their memories, like our own, reveal much about their actions in the present and inform every story in which we encounter them.</p>
