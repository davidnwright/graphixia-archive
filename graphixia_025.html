<p>Continuity - in characterization, the details of character evolution and origins, and the universes that heroes participate in – is essential for the reader of mainstream superhero comics in order to create a sense of personal investment in both the storyline and the heroes themselves. The readership paradoxically demands a strict adherence to the ‘reality’ of the universe in which they encounter their fictional characters, while accepting that these characters are often imbued with specious or fantastic powers. Scholarship as well likes absolutes in order to generate discussion – we need stability in our referents in order to be able to construct arguments where basic principles are understood by our audiences. In dealing with characters that have been written about over, quite frequently, more than half a century, authors frequently encounter many problems in navigating the demands of the universes that they are writing for.<p>

<p>Long-running comics present a number of issues in regard to consistency in their narration and plot points because of their polyphonic nature, with each subsequent author of a character wanting to put his or her own mark on the title. This said, when faced with a character like Spider-Man, an author doesn’t so much write the character as he writes ‘into’ or ‘for’ him based on the precedents that have been established by previous authors – current popular comics’ writers like Bendis, Johns and Morrison are all self-professed superhero scholars, capable of citing decades-old details and sometimes retconning these to attempt to reinvigorate characters that have grown static or playing to audiences that appreciate nostalgia in their stories. Individual authorship here is problematic, and one cannot help but be tempted to invoke Foucault’s author function in light of the way that the superhero genre is delivered, inferring that in comics the primacy of content over authorial context has finally found purchase. This can be both a positive and negative attribute of comics, though, as it creates a sense of familiarity but can also inhibit character growth and development.</p>

<p>This was not always the case, however. In early Spider-Man,for example, when he was a new and inviting character, consistency mattered much less than it now does with Amazing Spider- Man nearing its 700th issue. In his first appearance in Amazing Fantasy #15, even Spider-Man’s name wasn’t consistent, alternating between “Spiderman” and the hyphenated “Spider-Man.” J. Jonah Jameson, publisher of the Daily Bugle, shifted to becoming the publisher of “Now” magazine and then back to the Bugle in early issues of Amazing, and other problems arose regarding adherence to detail in subsequent issues based on information given previously. However, even in these early stages of Spider-Man’s development, we can see how creator Stan Lee was aware that outside reality in his fantasy needed to be maintained - the first appearance of the Vulture, in Amazing #2, makes sure to let the reader know that the villain’s wings are an artificial construction, even while the onlookers of his crimes are perplexed as to how a man could fly on his own power. Though the reader is asked to suspend reality to the degree that he can accept his hero’s abilities, grounding this belief in a plausible framework is essential for the hero’s (and the title’s) success. Spider-Man’s webs, for example, are explained as a “special fluid” that is a product of his prowess in chemistry, and Lee refined these details in order to make a central, coherent universe in which the character could operate – with occasional crossovers with other titles like Fantastic Four and X-Men – before leaving the series with issue #110 in the hands of Gerry Conway. The central aspects of Spider-Man’s origins remained (and still remain) constant, ensuring continuing leadership, despite numerous retellings and revisionings, such as Loeb and Sale’s compelling Spider-Man: Blue. Suspension of reality, then, only goes so far as to invite the reader to participate in the universe of the superhero, and once the universe has been defined, it is fixed – too much cognitive disconnect within it and the reader is not able to identify with the title, whether this be in the reality of the universe itself or in the nuances of the plotlines, carried out over decades.</p>

<p>As Spider-Man continued and more authors were accepted intothe fold, new series arose – Spectacular Spider-Man first in the 70’s, followed by Web of Spider-Man in the 80’s and simply Spider-Man in the 90’s, each having to adhere to the information that came before it. Though there were some shake-ups in character development, anything that was a huge reversal for the character was both denounced by the readership and reworked so as to eliminate consistency issues – this was most notable recently in the Clone Saga, where it was revealed that the Peter Parker we had been following was actually the ‘real’ Spider-Man’s clone (very confusing), and in Civil War, where Spider-Man revealed his identity to the world under the Superhuman Registration Act. This latter was so reviled by the readership of Marvel Comics, as shown through letters to the publisher and on Marvel’s message boards, that immediately on the conclusion of the summer ‘event’ of Civil War, Spider-Man’s identity was re-concealed from the world (thanks to the efforts of Dr. Strange) so as to maintain the central attributes that, in effect, make Spider-Man the familiar character that the readership demands. Changes have occurred, certainly, as otherwise the title would hardly be as entertaining as it is and readers would become tired of repeated storylines. Indeed, Conway, in making his own mark, within two years of taking over Amazing, killed off love interest Gwen Stacy and introducing the Punisher, currently a mainstay of the Marvel Universe. Peter Parker has had several careers, from photographer to high school teacher to, currently, a professional academic in a think-tank. One sees that there is a progression in characterization that is more fulfillment of Parker’s original desire for acceptance amongst his peers (though, admittedly, that peer group has changed as he has aged), but the central tenets of what we could consider a platonic “Spider-Man” must be acknowledged when writing for the character. More importantly, the details of all of these stages of progression are of extreme significance to the long-term reader that has given Spider-Man (and countless other heroes) such success – from names and dates to particular issue numbers when characters have been killed off, revamped, gotten married or had children, the comic reader has become invested in the details just as much as any scholar who has a practiced hand at close reading.</p>

<p>The author of superhero comics is then presented with a readership that is arguably far more demanding than in any other genre or medium; he must cater to the nostalgic elements of the character he is assigned which have ensured his title’s longevity while still offering compelling narratives that will entice the reader into continuing to follow the hero’s adventures. When a major alteration is attempted, this is interestingly accomplished outside of the mainstream universe in which the reader has his particular expectations that authors will adhere to the detailed histories of their characters. For Marvel, the central universe has been named “Earth 616” – this is the environment that most casual comics’ readers will be familiar with, and what we might think of as canon. The panoply of Marvel characters function in this universe, and they must adhere to the rich histories that have come in countless crossovers, guest appearances and in their own multiple titles. Reboots and dramatic shifts are so anathema to comics’ mainstay readership that they must occur under what are normally considered “imprints” of the central publishing line and are therefore understood to be outside of the main continuity; these have been, notably, “New Universe,” “Ultimate Comics” and most recently “Icon,” though there have been many others over the decades.</p>

<p>While Spider-Man asks the reader to set aside notions of plausibility in the character’s origin (and the origins of some of his notable opponents), this must be compensated for by a far stricter adherence to the realities of the fictional world in which he acts. Though this was quite simple in the earliest issues of the title (even if it was somewhat ineffective), when Marvel began in Amazing #1 asking for audience participation and investment in the form of letters, it began engendering a response that was highly engaged in the storylines and consistency of character and plot details. Even the first letters, printed in issue #3 of Amazing, highlight the nature of this engagement; for this letters page, Margaret Seth wrote: “Having read almost as many stories as you have written I feel my opinion is as good as the next fellow’s. Meaning to say that your startling story in #1 copy of Spider-Man was terrific. But may I ask what in the world did you do to the second part? Is he so different that nothing can go his way? Your next issue is supposed to be great, but if more of your fans such as I feel this way after reading the first issue… well, I don’t think I’d waste my good money on another copy like the first.” (<a href="http://spiderfan.org/comics/reviews/spiderman_amazing/003.html">Citation</a>). It is this attitude amongst readers, demanding consistency even in character reaction to his fictional world, that has created the investment that has made the character last for so long – it is also this now involuntary close reading on the part of the fans that demands that the particularities of the interactional space be fixed, as readers trace out the complex histories of even the most peripheral characters and feel invested in the imaginary world of their heroes.</p>
