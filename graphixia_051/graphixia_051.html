<P>When I read Tintin books as a child, their politics were never an issue. I only concerned myself with adventure and the delightful drawings and colours. Hergé’s earliest efforts, <em>Tintin in the Land of the Soviets</em> and <em>Tintin in the Congo</em>--crude, unresearched endeavors--were no available. <em>Tintin in America</em> with its “red” Indians and Al Capone seemed innocent enough in the 1970s, particularly from a Canadian perspective; we held all the stereotypes about the United States that the book did. So it has been a surprise to return to the early Tintin and find politics all over the place. These politics were complicated by editorial requirements. <em>Tintin in the Land of the Soviets</em> and <em>Tintin in the Congo </em>were commissioned by Abbé Norbert Wallez, Hergé’s editor at <em>Le Petit Vingtième</em>, as anti-Soviet propaganda and an endorsement of Belgian rule respectively (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tintin">The Adventures of Tintin</a>). So it is as difficult to grasp Hergé’s actual politics from them as it is to glean anything about the inner psyche of his hero. Except to say that Hergé was perfectly willing to write such texts for his conservative Roman Catholic newspaper, just as he was willing to put Tintin in <em>Le Soir</em>, the same French language, pro-occupation paper that Paul de Man wrote for during World War II (<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/books/2012/01/herge-the-the-difficult-herg-the- difficult-past-of-tintins-creator.html">CBC Books</a>). By all accounts, though, <em>The Blue Lotus </em>marks a turn for Hergé. In this book, he shifts from stereotype and fantasy to research and detail (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Lotus">The Blue Lotus</a>). Instead of making unreflective, stereotypical representations of nations as he does with The Soviet Union, The Congo, and The United States, Hergé tries to represent China of the 1930s with accuracy and sympathy. By doing so, he disparages European colonial powers, but more importantly, Japan.</p>

<p>Page 6 of <em>The Blue Lotus,</em> with its striking page layout, is the crucial one for establishing Hergé’s cultural negotiations. A typical Tintin page consists of four rows of panels of uniform height and variable width. Each row generally contains three to four panels. This page, however, consists of typical top and bottom rows with a large streetscape panel occupying the space usually taken by the middle two rows. The way this middle panel anchors and controls the way we read the top row of panels, which refers to the Japanese arch-villain Mr Mitsuhirato, and the bottom row of panels, which depicts the crude racism of the European Gibbons, establishes the political hegemony of Tintin over China, that is, the hegemony of the “true” European as opposed to the perverse and arrogant European represented by Gibbons and the slick, deceptive Japanese Mr Mitsuhirato.</p>

<p>The top three panels across the top show Tintin responding to a letter from Mr. Mitsuhirato and preparing to call upon him. </p>

<p>We will later learn that Mitsuhirato, drawn with a pig-nosed face, orchestrates the sabotage of the South Manchurian railway line as a means for Japan to make further incursions into China. For now, though, Tintin is impressed: “he’s certainly a man with impeccable manners....” Snowy asks, “Are Japanese good chaps, Tintin?” If our ears are attuned to irony, we will know that we are being set up here. Tintin is too impressed, and Snowy’s comment raises doubts, questioning rather than affirming Tintin’s opinion of Mitsuhirato. Everything in these panels is based on the letter that Mitsuhirato has sent, not on Tintin’s first hand experience; all his interpretations are speculative: “I wonder how Mr Mitsuhirato knew I was here.”</p>

<p>In the bottom three panels, however, Tintin literally collides with European arrogance:</p>

<p>[picture: bottom_02.jpg]</p>

<p>A man in European dress, whom we later learn is named Gibbons, walks into the street without looking. He is reading his newspaper as he walks, apparently expecting all traffic to come to a halt for him. He doesn’t need to look; the natives must look out for him. Tintin’s rickshaw driver is unable to stop and crashes into Gibbons, who responds vehemently, holding his cane above his head as if to strike: “Dirty little China-man!...To barge into a white man!” So a page that begins with a reflection on the “impeccable manners” displayed in Mitsuhirato’s lette ends with an exhibition of utmost rudeness from Gibbons.</p>

<p>The large middle frame turns the page into a dialectic with Tintin being the term that mediates and supersedes Mitsuhirato and Gibbons.</p>

<p>The wide angle streetscape offers a comprehensive picture of harmony, anchored by  Tintin and Snowy in the back of the rickshaw. Tintin looks resplendent, even princely, in this panel. Both he and Snowy sit politely, almost primly. While the Rickshaw driver’s ribs are showing and his mouth is open to get as much air in him as possible, the other faces in the panel are smiling. A close look at the panel reveals boxes, pails, buckets and baskets as most people are carrying something, suggesting industry. Banners cross the street horizontally and signs hang down vertically, creating the image of a vibrant street: busy but orderly. Gibbons upsets that order, as we can see from Tintin’s disordered tie, the droplets shooting from his head, and Snowy’s raised eyebrows. We see a distinct contrast here between correct and incorrect European behaviour, with Gibbons as the corrupt exponent of colonial power, and “our superb western civilisation” (7) and Tintin as the ideal version: dominant but quiet and polite. The good European fits into the picture; he doesn’t disrupt it.</p>

<p>Later in the book, Tintin saves Chang Chong-chen from the river. Chang is surprised that Tintin has saved him, given Chang’s presumptions about westerners: “I thought all white devils were wicked, like those who killed my grandfather and grandmother long ago,” referring to the Boxer Rebellion. Tintin responds with mid 1930s multiculturalism: “You see, different peoples don’t know enough about each other” (43). He then goes through a list of European misconceptions about the Chinese: “all Chinese are cunning and cruel and wear pigtails, are always inventing tortures, and eating rotten eggs and swallows’ nests...” (43). Right after Tintin runs through this list, Hergé cuts to a panel with Mitsuhirato and his pig nose.</p>

<p>The juxtaposition is incredible, as though Hergé is blind to the import of his own character’s words. Different peoples don’t know enough about each other; they have preconceptions and prejudices that we must see through...and by the way, here’s an image of a Japanese man with a pig face. The sociable understanding that Tintin and Chang come to about their people’s prejudices towards each other clearly does not extend to the Japanese. We can erase notions of Chinese foot-binding and infanticide and Western devils from our heads, but not the piggish qualities of the Japanese.</p>

<p>Whatever <em>The Blue Lotus</em> says about European arrogance, racism, and entitlement is redeemed by the doubling of Tintin and Chang: two boys who overcome their differences and work together: “What a good friend you are, Chang!” (47). But Mitsuhirato has no redemptive qualities and no explanation that his evil is particular and individual rather than representative of a whole people. Gibbons’ brutality on page 6 is offset by Tintin’s politeness and western apologism. Mitsuhirato’s “impeccable manners” in his letter to Tintin are simply and thoroughly undercut.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, <em>The Blue Lotus</em> is just as ideological and stereotypical as <em>Tintin in the Land of the Soviets</em> and <em>Tintin in the Congo</em>. Hergé critiques Europeans, but only the bad ones. He celebrates the Chinese. But he excoriates the Japanese and does so through animalistic caricature, foreshadowing the representation of the Japanese during World War II when the Allies paid special attention to the “racial differences” between the Japanese and the Chinese. While Hergé ostensibly supports the notion that different cultures have to make more effort to understand each other, his support extends only to friendly nations and peoples. It is still legitimate to	portray people and cultures you don’t like as animals. This portrayal is doubly significant for the medium of comics which depends so much on caricature, raising questions about the image of the “enemy” in comics and its relation to the the racial other.</p>
