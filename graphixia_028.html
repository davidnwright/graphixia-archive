<p>Two things are important to know about Batman/Bruce Wayne: 1) he's bent on revenge and vigilante justice; 2) he's bored.</p>

<p>Boredom is a running theme in <em>Batman</em>. Everyone--Batman, the villains, the People of Gotham--is bored, except the police who are kept busy because everyone else is so bored they keep committing crimes. The dominance of boredom as a theme in <em>Batman </em>comics brings about a discussion of motivations. Is boredom a motivation in <em>Batman</em>? Does the Batman come about as a result of the boredom that consumes the lonely, but filthy-rich, Bruce Wayne? Taking Umberto Eco's ideas in the <em>Myth of Superman </em>as a starting point, there's an argument to be made that says modern comicbook superheroes are not only "inconsumable," they're stuck in perpetual boredom as a result. Boredom, or having time on one's hands, is an essential component of the comicbook superhero. Even their jobs--usually as newspaper reporters / photographers, or independently wealthy scientists--allow for big chunks of unoccupied time where boredom leads to fantastic creativity, particularly in the manufacture of skills, weaponry, and the collection, implementation, and amassing of intelligence. In short, boredom is the superhero's trump card.</p>

<p>The header of the first <em>Batman</em> story runs as follows: "The 'Bat-Man.' A mysterious and adventurous figure, fighting for righteousness and apprehending the wrong doer, in his lone battle against the evil forces of society... his identity remains unknown." We are then introduced to "The home of commissioner Gordon, who at the moment is entertaining his young socialite friend, Bruce Wayne." Wayne, smoking a pipe and leaning dejectedly on his palm, asks Gordon, "Well commissioner, anything exciting happening these days?" Mimicking the set-up of Sherlock Holmes in which Holmes is utterly bored with nothing to do, the comic introduces a murder and the detective narrative is off. But it all starts as a cure for boredom, not the need to impose a higher moral purpose and understanding. As soon as the action heats up in the story, Bruce Wayne grows bored, and, tapping out his pipe, he tells Gordon: "Ho Hum! I'll leave you here to finish your work... I'm going home." Of course, much action occurs afterward with Batman solving, and explaining how he solved, the case. The end of the story comes after Bruce Wayne visits the commissioner again and, after listening to Gordon's recounting of the previous night's affair, remarks, "Hmm, a very lovely fairy-tale commissioner indeed." The commissioner, lighting a celebratory cigar after Wayne has left, mutters, "Bruce Wayne is a nice chap, but he certainly must lead a boring life... seems disinterested in everything." The final two frames of the story reveal Bruce Wayne as the Batman. The irony isn't lost on the reader: Bruce Wayne isn't bored or disinterested, he's The Bat-Man!</p>

<p>All this to note that at the beginning of the next story, the preamble reads a little differently: "The 'Bat-Man,' a mysterious and adventurous figure, fighting for righteousness and apprehending the menaces of society in his lone battle against the evil. His identity remains unknown (He is one Bruce Wayne, bored young socialite.)" Boredom, then, has become one of the primary descriptors of The Bat-Man's identity. To take it a step further, one of the primary reasons Bruce Wayne fights crime is because he's bored. As noted in a <a href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2011/06/13/27-batman-origins-and-revisions/">previous post</a>, at the earlier stages of the <em>Batman</em> comic book, we don't yet have the revenge origin story. In the beginning, there was boredom without revenge.</p>

<p>Batman's boredom is an alibi, it allows him to protect his secret identity (how could someone so boring be the Batman?), and, later, it masks a deep-seated moral righteousness that fuels his on-going quest for revenge. He is someone who has it all, except excitment in his life. Even his coterie of villans lack motivation after a while and exist solely to get the Batman--they're all so bored with petty crimes they need to make things personal. Frank Miller has The Joker so bored he's in a coma for a decade because the Bat-Man retires.</p>

<p>What boredom tells us about Superheroes is that their motivations were, and are, not always about doing the right thing, or taking the moral high ground (no matter how tenuously). Instead, our heroes sometimes typify the crisis of modern life: filling those moments where there's nothing to do with something meaningful. The moral of these tales might well be that if you're bored, as so many kids then and now are, go out and do something righteous and mysterious, not criminal.</p>

<p>Moreover, Batman's bored alter-ego represents a counter-point to the exciting, dangerous, life of a crime-fighter. It conveys a lack of seriousness about something (crime, impetus, disguise) that is usually seen as a very serious matter. Our heroes have a sense of flippancy and irreverence that we often miss in our suspension of disbelief. How our heroes cope with, and dispatch, their boredom is as much a morality tale as is fighting crime.</p>
