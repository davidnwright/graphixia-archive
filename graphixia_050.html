<P>Peter Wilkins and David N. Wright started the <em>Graphixia</em> blog over a year ago. It began as a writing project on Google Documents in which Peter and Dave traded paragraphs on comics in a quasi-critical dialogue, trying to figure out if they had anything notable to say about comics.</p>

<p>After one false start, Peter and Dave set up <em>Graphixia</em> as a weekly writing project to replace the now flagging Google Documents exchange. The idea was to produce 500 words per post on whatever struck their interest about comics. Things really took off when Brenna Clarke Gray and Scott Marsden joined the conversation, diversifying the blog’s content and broadening its critical horizons.</p>

<p>In order to maintain momentum and improve content, <em>Graphixia</em> presents this 50th post setting the following goals for the coming year: <ul> <li>improve the quality of content making it more akin to that found in an academic journal</li> <li>produce a style sheet and ensure that posts are properly documented</li> <li>establish a backlog of posts in order to ensure regular publication every Tuesday at 6:00 AM</li> <li>produce at least 4 podcasts per year at scheduled intervals during the seasonal solstice</li> <li>invite and peer-review submissions</li> <li>network with other, like-minded blogs and comics researchers to raise the profile of comics scholarship</li> <li>explore different ways to use web resource and computer technology to enhance the discussion of comics and to link that discussion with the broader endeavours of the Digital Humanities</li> <li>produce an “Annual” that publishes its yearly work in either e-book or print form</li> <li>submit papers to comics conferences and journals to enhance our reputation as a hub of comics scholarship and investigate institutional affiliations</li> <li>host an academic conference of 3-5 days in the summer of 2013.</li> </ul> Thanks to everyone for continuing to read and support <em>Graphixia</em> this year. We look forward to providing more insightful and enthusiastic commentary on comics. If you are a comics scholar, practitioner, or fan, consider submitting a post idea to <em>Graphixia</em>.
