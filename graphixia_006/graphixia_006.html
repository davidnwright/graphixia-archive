<p>Unlike our earlier examples taken from <em>Fun Home</em>, Moore's and Gibbons' aesthetic approach in <em>Watchmen</em> presents a representation of character and setting that resists entrenchment in the standardized aesthetic tropes of traditional superhero comic books. The deep purples and pastel hues of <em>Watchmen</em> reflect an almost self-referential awareness of the aesthetic limits of the traditional medium. Whereas classic superhero comics tended to focus on highlighting the three primary colours, Moore and Gibbons push the palette to acutely signal their shift away from the aesthetics and story-telling principles of traditional superhero narratives.</p>

<p>Moreover, Moore and Gibbons use colour in a way that signals different emotional elements than the reader expects from the comic book aesthetic. Where readers of traditional superhero comic books expect colour to signal rightness, nationalism, even a halo of holiness, readers of <em>Watchmen</em> are confronted	with an aesthetic that suggests decay, rot, and obscured realities.</p>

<p>Take for example yellow circles. A seemingly innocuous icon,
			the yellow circle appears throughout traditional superhero comic
			books in numerous forms. Indeed, once you start looking for them,
			they're everywhere. Often adding richness to the white
			alternative, the yellow background usually appears in the form of
			a bright, solar orb. The most famous example appears in
			<em>Action Comics</em> #1; the first Superman episode. </p>

<p>Here, the yellow orb signals Superman's power and, metaphorically, the hope that he offers to those oppressed by the criminal elements, or those persecuted by the over-arching power of others--it suggests his moral "rightness."</p>

<p>The next example comes from January 1942 <em>Sensation Comics</em> and features  Wonder Woman charging forward against a yellow orb in background. As with Superman, Wonder Woman appears as a bastion of hope and redemption against an evil and corrupt world.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that in both cases, though more explicitly in Wonder Woman, the costumes the heroes wear fetishize the American Flag--the flag even appears to waving proudly to the right of Wonder Woman. The costumes and the yellow orb also tie-in well together, with the yellow accents of the costume reflecting the background, while the predominantly red and blue composition of the costume completes a circle of primary colours. In short, the superhero's aesthetic is drawn from a primary palette which stands out against the often drab, grey, and muted colours of the background. This primary palette in turn suggests the strict lines of moral imperative for the characters--they do not wander from that which is right into shades of evil.</p>

<p>However, <em>Watchmen</em> begins with a visual metaphor that asserts a move away from the traditional primary palette at the same time as the story itself signals a shift away from traditional superhero stories and clear moral paradigms. <em>Watchmen</em> begins with a close-up on a yellow orb, but in this instance the yellow orb appears as an ironic happy face icon covered in blood. As the image sequence continues, it gradually pulls away from the yellow happy face, red blood, and blue sewer incorporating ever more subtle pastel hues while leaving the traditional palette and story-line behind. The yellow orb becomes a fleshy, stubbled  bald spot on the police detective's head.</p>

<p>In <em>Watchmen</em>, superheroes tend to sink in, rather than standout from, yellow backgrounds. Characters such as Rorschach cohere more readily with the black background elements of the background just as Dr. Manhattan's eerie soft blue is obscured by the pastel green background.</p>

<p>The aesthetic is meant to wash out the distinctions between good and evil, vice or virtue, and focus our attention on the difficulty of simple distinctions. In <em>Watchmen</em>'s fatalistic aesthetic, the yellow orbs drawn as clocks, radiation hazard signs, and happy faces suggest impending disaster, nuclear fallout, and sinister ironies which are a long way from the faithful moral background that guides Superman and Wonder Woman.</p>
