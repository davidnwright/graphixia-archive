		<description></description> The superhero's identity, the way that it
		condenses a repressed identity in costume and metonymy while
		producing an identity split in the charater who becomes the hero, has
		a surprising  affinity with identity themes in "serious" graphic
		narratives. In Chris Ware's <em>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on
		Earth</em>, Jimmy's Superman pyjamas overtly play off of the
		superhero motif. Through a visual inversion, the doughy, infantile
		Jimmy is the diametrical opposite of Superman; yet the "S" on Jimmy's
		chest and the way Ware's drawings keep drawing our attention to it,
		insist that Jimmy's quest for his father has something to do with
		Superman.

	Alison Bechdel's graphic memoir, <em>Fun Home: A Family Tragic
Comic</em>, makes no sly iconic reference to superhero comics, but Bruce
Bechdel, Alison's father, wrestles as much with the split in his identity as
any costumed superhero. Fun Home presents Alison Bechdel's open lesbian
identity as built upon the closeted homosexuality of her father who may have
committed suicide because he was unable to handle the contradiction between
his outward identity as heterosexual family man and his "inner" identity as a
gay man. Like Bruce Wayne, Bruce Bechdel is something of a slave to the suit,
the costume.
<what>to Batman's (and perhaps all superheroes') </what>
"identity" is metonymy, the associations through costume, tools that allow
Batman to show himself while also being masked or veiled. Batman must be
simultaneously overtly on display and hidden. In Fun Home the same is true of
Bruce Bechdel. Bruce Bechdel's veiled homosexuality is revealed and screened
simultaneously by his house restoration which becomes a baroque fun house of
mirrors. The house is a metonymy for his self-veiling but also for his desire
to come out. This paradox is entirely along the lines of Bruce Wayne/
Batman's "here I am, masked" contradiction. An  obsession with details stands
for the characters' inner being as the signifiers of veiling and unveiling.
This metonymy both says something about the character, gives clues to his or
her secret identity, as it also acts as an alibi for, or distraction from,
that identity.

	Alison serves as an interpreter of that identity, akin to the person
obsessed with revealing the real human being beneath the costume. Part of the
set-up of the superhero identity is the person who "almost knows" that the
hero is such and such a person. In this role in <em>Fun Home</em> Alison
searches for the confirming proof that Bruce was indeed gay. She reads all
the signs (an obsession with flowers and appearance) and interprets the
evidence (the fact that Bruce has been arrested for suspicious activity with
a minor), but remains in doubt as to his truth: do his dalliances count as
thorough going homosexuality?

		<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[The interplay
		between costume, metonymy, and identity might best be described as a
		“paradox of identity.” The phrase tries to capture the fluidity that
		marks identity in graphic narratives.

	Most important in identifying the paradoxical nature of the
character’s identity are the costume, the objects he comes in contact with,
and often the emotional or physical crisis that leads the character into the
paradoxical--or split--identity in the first place. When the reader comes in
contact with the paradoxical representations of identity—often subversive and
latent / secret and visible—s/he is forced into an ambiguous interpretive
space where s/he cannot quite arrive at a stable understanding of the
character’s “true” identity.

	With Superman, the reader’s paradoxical interpretation is most evident in
Clark Kent. Clark is Superman’s secret identity. Unlike other costumed
superheroes, Superman is the “real” person and Clark Kent is the costumed,
disguised “hero.” The reader then sympathizes with Clark Kent--the Everyman
hero--but longs to be the real person--morally upstanding, strong,
attractive--that is Superman. Whereas a superhero such as Batman conceals his
true identity—the everyday individual—and puts forward another identity to
the world--The Batman--Superman conceals his otherworldliness by costuming
himself as the mild-mannered, common man.

	The interplay between concealment and exposition in the superhero’s
identity suggest that the text and image negotiate a subversive or latent
space for interpretation as well. At times, the text spells out the action in
the images. At other times, the text encourages the reader to interpret the
images in a specific way, or context. The art and text participate in a kind
of dance where each will conceal and display--at the same time, as opposing
forces, or as collaboration. This interplay between text and image suggests
that the text and image are participating in a similar negotiation between
concealment and exposition as the reader is when interpreting the paradoxes
of identity contained within the character. What emerges then is a nascent
pattern inherent in both superhero and “serious” graphic narratives; that the
structure or apparatus for story-telling inherently solicits paradoxical
interpretations from the reader who cannot avoid consistent bouts of
re-interpretation and going-back-over to stabilize the myriad structures of
representation.

	The interpretive exercises the reader undertakes in reading a graphic
narrative are paradoxical in nature because they rely on the reader’s fluid
movement  between concealment and exposition / text and image. The narrative
structure then is a metonym for the paradoxical identity of the characters:
Jimmy Corrigan is both Superman and Everyman, both drawn and imagined;
Superman is both super and ordinary; Bruce Bechdel is both homosexual and
heterosexual.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[In <em>Fun Home</em>,
Alison Bechdel goes to Greek mythology (via James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em>)
to find a model for her father. She compares Bruce to Dedalus, the
"artificer"  who constructed a labyrinth for King Minos and made wax wings so
that his son, Icarus, might fly.  Both of these stories are key to Bechdel's
forensic unfolding of her father's life as they construct him as one who
shows and conceals simlutaneously.

	In the myth of the labyrinth, Dedalus builds the labyrinth to
trap the Minotaur, the half man/half bull monster who threatens Crete. For
Fun Home, Bruce embodies both the master craftsman and the monster, for what
he must conceal within the labyrinth are his sexual urges. And so, the
labyrinth becomes a metaphor for the repressed. The Bechdel family's gothic
revival house serves as a figure for this repression.  Bruce is so obsessed
with the details of his house and their perfect arrangement that it becomes
clear that the house itself becomes a kind of "costume," that conceals and
reveals, protects and exposes Bruce.  The house is something that Bruce
throws himself into as he pursues perfection: "He was an alchemist of
appearance, a savant of surface, a Dedalus of decor (6).  Appearance,
surface, and decor all simultaneously fend off and invite an engagement with
truth, depth, and substance. This paradox is what David is talking about when
he writes about the problem of the superhero's mask and costume. In veiling
himself, the superhero begs exposure, and every effort at concealment is also
a clue that could possibly reveal. The same is true for Bruce Bechdel; the
baroque details of his house seal up and provide a buffer for his gay
identity--a woman visiting the house almost walks into a mirror because she
is so disoriented by Bruce's designs--at the same time as they testify to it.
The chandeliers, mirrors and gilt cornices become for Alison Bechdel the very
signs of homosexuality. And not without some irony, as they enter the world
of gay stereotypes: the lisp, the voice, the funny hand gestures.

	This treatment of the detail in both the superhero and the normal graphic
narrative suggests an ambivalence about the substance of identity. It's
possible that identity could just be decor, appearance, facade: A lure with
nothing behind it. Rorschach in Watchmen actually demonstrates the desire for
that to be true: his mask is not a mask but his "face." And Rorschach's mask
is the most obscuring of masks, the antithesis of the mask that merely blacks
out the area around the eyes. Rorschach is the costume and the costume is
him. His alter-ego is a bit of nothing that he would just as soon obliterate.
What Rorschach hides is not what your typical superhero conceals: shame.
Bruce Bechdel in <em>Fun Home</em> conceals shame also behind a constantly
shifting facade. Perhaps that is incorrect. Perhaps for Bruce there is an
on/off identity switch: or a gay/straight switch. When he is in straight
mode, everything is devoted to sealing up his homosexuality in baroque
design. That the house is a "gothic revival" is apt because the gothic house
is all about concealing a secret that the innocent wayfarer exposes.  The
whole purpose of Bruce's house is to "contain" the secret of his
homosexuality. As Alison writes, "our house was not a real home at all but
[rather] the simulacrum of one, a museum" (17).]]>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Myth-making in the
graphic narrative is a parallel structure of sorts. Identity itself is
closely connected to an invented mythology: no matter how one conceptualizes
it, the structures behind a character’s identity, and the stability of those
structures, are reliant on the believability of the character’s mythology.
That said, we can take this myth-making a step further when we consider that
the narrative structure of the graphic narrative owes a good deal to the
structures of epic poetry and its corresponding mythological characters.

	However, a central difference in the graphic narrative is that
in most cases the epic structure is constructed to put forward the myth of
the social misfit--or, loser--rather than the mythological model of chivalry
and model citizenship. The secret identity that lies behind the mythological
mask is most often that of a disaffected and dislocated individual who
doesn’t fit in with social narratives common to traditional mythological
heroes. Indeed, the central characters are often bad leaders and overtly
individual; one has a difficult time extracting the "heroic" qualities of the
epic character.

	Superheroes, and even central figures in normal graphic narratives, tend
to represent disenfranchised groups or individuals. Central characters play
out narratives about over-coming weakness, or admitting to it, isolation
while at the same time assert the role of racial, sexual, and religious
minorities in shaping our cultural narratives. Depending on how one reads
Superman, he is either a displaced minority sent to earth so humanity can
continue on without fear of criminal behaviour or a socially awkward freak
who leans toward fetishizing his social superiority through costume and
method acting. Jimmy Corrigan is likewise either a socially disconnected
Mama’s boy searching for icons of a lost father, or a sympathetic anti-hero
who stands in for all that is good and trusting about humanity. Spiderman is
an alienated, socially awkward teenager, who, because he possesses an
alternative genetic structure created by a rogue strain of DNA that he
neither asked for or wants is literally "climbing the walls" trying to fit
into—or fight against—inclusion in a social order.

	The trouble with these oppositional identities is that they create a
vacuum into the reader falls. The character identities are always locked in
this parallel structure wherein the mythological identity—the Batman—can
never come in contact with the epic identity--the Bruce Wayne. The
mythological identity is fixed--Batman, Superman, Bruce Bechdel the father,
Jimmy Corrigan the Mama’s boy--but the epic identity--Bruce Wayne, Clark
Kent, Bruce Bechdel Gay man, Jimmy Corrigan truth seeker--is always in
development, always questing, always fighting, meeting each new adventure
with skill and cunning, all the while inhabiting the world underneath the
mask--or as Hollis Mason suggests “Under the Hood.” What graphic narratives
play out is that what Peter calls "the substance of identity" is not located
in the "décor, appearance, or façade," but it is managed from behind and the
represented through the mythological mask--a mirrored metaphor for all that
lies beneath. The result is that characters are always locked in a retarded
structure—even though they learn, their stories are already told. There’s
always another origin story to unravel, another quest to go on, and another
crime to prevent. The reader is left to reconcile the mythological and epic,
static and fluid, identities.]]>


<title>#5 The Image as Mask</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Comic  book art has
less to do with verisimilitude, perhaps, than caricature.  The artist has a
“way” of drawing a particular character that ensures  consistency from frame
to frame. This consistency establishes an  iterability that collapses or
reduces the “face” of a character to tics,  lines, a limited number of
expressions.

	With serialized comics, such  as superhero comics, it is a
shock when a different artist draws the  series. It is both exciting and
discombobulating. We see a new way of  presenting the character, but also a
disturbing deviation from the past.  Things do not seem correct. We can look
at the historical development  of Batman, for instance, passing through the
hands of various artists,  growing stockier then more elongated, and feel a
kind of disorientation.

	Alison Bechdel encodes this disorientation in Fun Home  by presenting
Bruce Bechdel in two visual modes: cartoon and simulated  photograph. Like
any comic artist, Bechdel has a “way” of drawing Bruce.  Here is an example:
<img class="center"
src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/
Fba7JgYVt43iBiSWaiiGau36VK4pffhyEFOdeLQ2CuULecjYNa3IyK3WGQBqjeAiFb_19T_XKuVpg
9cHVb0-i-pBITJMA8FfVEy3NShxiXeg3o9hfg" alt="" width="250px;" height="238px;"
/>

	This simple, iterable cartoon Bruce contrasts with Bruce in the
“photograph”:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/
fun_home_peter_01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-47"
title="fun_home_peter_01"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/
fun_home_peter_01-300x264.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="264" /></a>

	As  we can see, Bruce looks distinctly different in the “photograph” than
 he does in the generic frames of the text, replaying the identity  duality
in the text. Once we have seen the “photograph,” which is the  first image
that we see in the text, it is difficult to view the cartoon  image as
anything but a mask or screen. We say to ourselves, “that’s  not him at all.”
The cartoon picture is a mere place holder for the  genuine image. While the
cartoon image of Bruce is up front, all there,  without shadow or darkness,
the simulated photograph is haunting,  immediately suggestive of darkness and
secrecy. The shadow on the left  side of his face gives him something of a
“Two Face” quality, making the  cartoon image appear to be missing a
dimension. The image challenges us  in a way that the cartoon never does. It
is truly spooky

	A  comparison of the simulated photograph and the actual photograph that 
Bechdel based her drawing on amplifies this spookiness. We can see a  kinship
between the drawing and the photograph right down to the shadow  on the left
side of the face.  “That’s him,” we might be inclined to  say. <img
class="center"
src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/
da5FuTkwL2qtQzEd3HcLGYKHojzeQXzcBjny6skzp5C7we0I6fPK2NAjWE3mVkXRXchcUY-
ciBto3DYSKCnNk53Z0PjrIhcK1Xu3NpbeNPGr8yC_" alt="" width="320px;"
height="178px;" />

	The  simulated photograph plays verisimilitude against caricature to
tease  us with the possibility of getting at the “real” Bruce, when in fact
all  that we get is a chain of images.

	Curiously,   the question of identity in the superhero comic is played
out in the  realm of caricature. Of course there is no “actual” Bruce Wayne
or Peter  Parker behind the image. But Fun Home uses  the cartoon image as a
way of addressing this absence in a memoir that  addresses real events. In a
way, there is no one behind Bechdel’s  images, either, and that’s the tragic
dimension of this “family  tragicomic.” Behind the cartoon lies the simulated
photograph, behind  the simulated photograph lies the “real” photograph, but
the chain stops  there.]]>


<title>#6 Image Metaphors, Morals, and Primary Colours</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Unlike our earlier
examples taken from <em>Fun Home</em>, Moore’s and Gibbons’ aesthetic
approach in <em>Watchmen</em> presents a representation of character and
setting that resists entrenchment in the standardized aesthetic tropes of
traditional superhero comic books. The deep purples and pastel hues of
<em>Watchmen</em> reflect an almost self-referential awareness of the
aesthetic limits of the traditional medium. Whereas classic superhero comics
tended to focus on highlighting the three primary colours, Moore and Gibbons
push the palette to acutely signal their shift away from the aesthetics and
story-telling principles of traditional superhero narratives.

	Moreover, Moore and Gibbons use colour in a way that signals
different emotional elements than the reader expects from the comic book
aesthetic. Where readers of traditional superhero comic books expect colour
to signal rightness, nationalism, even a halo of holiness, readers of
<em>Watchmen</em> are confronted with an aesthetic that suggests decay, rot,
and obscured realities.

	Take for example yellow circles. A seemingly innocuous icon, the yellow
circle appears throughout traditional superhero comic books in numerous
forms. Indeed, once you start looking for them, they’re everywhere. Often
adding richness to the white alternative, the yellow background usually
appears in the form of a bright, solar orb. The most famous example appears
in <em>Action Comics</em> #1; the first Superman episode. <p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/
superman_cover_011.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55"
title="superman_cover_01"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/
superman_cover_011.jpg" alt="" width="297" height="400" /></a></p> Here, the
yellow orb signals Superman’s power and, metaphorically, the hope that he
offers to those oppressed by the criminal elements, or those persecuted by
the over-arching power of others--it suggests his moral “rightness.”

	The next example comes from January 1942 <em>Sensation Comics</em> and
features  Wonder Woman charging forward against a yellow orb in background.
As  with Superman, Wonder Woman appears as a bastion of hope and redemption 
against an evil and corrupt world. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.comics.org/issue/1912/cover/4/?style=default"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54" title="wonder_woman_cover_01"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/
wonder_woman_cover_01.jpg" alt="Wonder Woman Cover Sensation Comics #1"
width="287" height="398" /></a></p> It is worth noting that in both cases,
though more explicitly in Wonder Woman, the costumes the heroes wear
fetishize the American Flag--the flag even appears to waving proudly to the
right of Wonder Woman. The costumes and the yellow orb also tie-in well
together, with the yellow accents of the costume reflecting the background,
while the predominantly red and blue composition of the costume completes a
circle of primary colours. In short, the superhero’s aesthetic is drawn from
a  primary palette which stands out against the often drab, grey, and muted
colours of the background. This primary palette in turn suggests the strict
lines of moral imperative for the characters--they do not wander from that
which is right into shades of evil.

	However, <em>Watchmen</em><em></em> begins with a visual metaphor that
asserts a move away from the traditional primary palette at the same time as
the story itself signals a shift away from traditional superhero stories and
clear moral paradigms. <em>Watchmen</em> begins with a close-up on a yellow
orb, but in this instance the yellow orb appears as an ironic happy face icon
covered in blood. As the image sequence continues, it gradually pulls away
from the yellow happy face, red blood, and blue sewer incorporating ever more
subtle pastel hues while leaving the traditional palette and story-line
behind. The yellow orb becomes a fleshy, stubbled  bald spot on the police
detective’s head. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/watchmen_i_01
.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56" title="watchmen_i_01"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/watchmen_i_01.
jpg" alt="Watchmen, Chapter One, Scene One" width="253" height="406"
/></a></p> In <em>Watchmen</em>, superheroes tend to sink in, rather than
standout from, yellow backgrounds. Characters such as Rorschach cohere more
readily with the black background elements of the background just as Dr.
Manhattan’s eerie soft blue is obscured by the pastel green background. <p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/
watchmen_xii_23.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57"

watchmen_xii_23.jpg" alt="Rorschach Meets His Maker " width="258"
height="406" /></a></p> The aesthetic is meant to wash out the distinctions
between good and evil, vice or virtue, and focus our attention on the
difficulty of simple distinctions. In <em>Watchmen</em>’s fatalistic
aesthetic, the yellow orbs drawn as clocks, radiation hazard signs, and happy
faces suggest impending disaster, nuclear fallout, and sinister ironies which
are a long way from the faithful moral background that guides Superman and
Wonder Woman.]]>


<title>#7 Metaphorical and Metonymical Identity</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[The discord between the
superhero’s secret and actual identity plays havoc with the metaphorical
dimension of identity, where an individual can substitute "I" for a function
or a name: I am a fireman; I am Bruce Wayne.

	The concept of the “alter ego” makes identity fundamentally
ironic, like the picture of the rabbit/duck that could be either thing,
depending on which way you look at it. 
<p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/64vf.jpg"><
img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-105" title="Bunny Duck"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/64vf.jpg"
alt="Bunny Duck" width="491" height="338" /></a></p> 
Moreover, this bifurcation or alternation of identity carries the additional irony of
actually grounding identity by stopping it from floating away in ghostly
metonymies. In other words, the either/or of the alter ego prevents both
amorphousness of identity and a never ending list of possible identities.

	<em>Fun Home</em> dwells on the way Alison and her father invoke the
metonymies of gender identity. Bruce has his obsession with decoration,
design, flowers and so forth, while Alison has her “masculine” clothes and
the nickname “Butch.” However, Bruce's  “gay” metonymies compete with those
of the heterosexual family man living in a small town.
<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Fun-Home-HB-
Alison-Bechdel-2006-0171.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91"

Alison-Bechdel-2006-0171.jpg" alt="Bruce in Fun Home Alison Bechdel"
width="678" height="322" /></a>
His
inability to substitute “I” with “gay” means that he represses the “symptoms”
of his homosexual identity, or tucks them away in secret corners. By hiding
something away, Bruce actually gives himself substance. He is something
“other” than he appears—just like Peter Parker or Bruce Wayne—and this
otherness prevents him from disappearing into the banality of failed family
man. As far as Alison is concerned, Bruce has to be reconstructed as his
alter ego. The rehabilitation of the father
is a necessary element of Alison's origin story, which develops to the point
where she is able to make the metaphorical gesture--“I am a Lesbian”--line up
perfectly with the metonymies that go with it. It is as if Alison were able
to declare herself Batman and never take off the costume, the tool belt and
so forth. By telling the story of her father as closeted gay man, Alison
attempts to perform the same gesture for her father. The gesture is
figuratively successful, as Bruce comes to “represent” the small-town
homosexual of the 1970s. A detour through
Daniel Clowe's <em>Ghost World</em> helps to illustrate the power of Alison
Bechdel's metaphorical identity. Enid Coleslaw in <em>Ghost World</em> offers
an example of identity that is all metonymy and no metaphor. She is unable to
solve for the X of identity, so she compensates by having a series of
“looks”--punk rocker, 1930s woman—one thing after another. Enid is like a
superhero who cannot settle on a particular costume or alter ego. Her
greatest desire is to find one look and stick with it, but that appears to be
impossible.  When Enid purchases what looks like a Batman or Catwoman mask at
Adam’s II sex shop, her mocking of the superhero’s fetishistic costume also
mocks her own inability to fill the mask, to be something under it. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/ghost-
world_33.jpg"></a><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/ghost-

world_33"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/ghost-world_33
.jpg" alt="" width="311" height="335" /></a>

	Consequently, Enid dissolves. At one point, her best friend Becky says
that Enid is getting blurry, difficult to see. The ghosts of <em>Ghost
World</em> are the looks that Enid produces, representing her inability to
anchor her identity.

	Alison’s discovery of her sexual identity in <em>Fun Home</em> shows why
identity politics are so powerful: they give the appearances and associations
that go with an identification substance because they are ostensibly rooted,
no longer free floating ghosts.  They anchor metonymies in a powerful
metaphor.]]>

principles that inform representations of identity in the graphic narrative
deserve closer scrutiny. If we take as a normative model the fractured
central character that dominates the genre, the reassembly and disassembly of
the reader plays an important role in the reader’s ongoing interpretation of
the text. Unlike other literary forms, how something looks on the page is
central to the understanding of a character’s identity.

	Central to representing the fractured and disillusioned central
characters that dominate the graphic narrative—and indeed the examples
explored here so far: Jimmy Corrigan, Bruce Wayne, the superheroes of
Watchmen, and Bruce Bechdel—is the fractured pagespace. Virtually all graphic
narratives violate the expectations of the genre at some point: crossing
gutters, combining panels, repeating imagery across panels. Rarely does the
traditional 9, 12, 16 panel grid remain intact over the course of a
full-length narrative. In particular, narratives that feature characters in
search of an identity emphasize the aesthetic possibilities offered by
fracturing the expectations of the medium. These artistic choices—breaking
the border, splitting characters in half, obscuring details—represent a
further metaphor through which the reader can engage with and conceptualize
emerging, and collapsing, identities.

	These aesthetic metaphors, in which the fractured expectations of the
genre stand in for latent or emergent psychological or physical states, work
much like literary tropes such as irony, self-referential narrative voices,
dialects / dictions / alliterations, or a suddenly altered narrative
sequence. And, as with literary tropes, aesthetic metaphors have varying
degrees of interpretive complexity.

	On a somewhat simplistic level, the artist relies on subtle shifts in the
frame to indicate time and, to some extend, emotion.

	<a

src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/
jimmy_corrigan_begins_02.jpg" alt="" width="588" height="482" /></a>In the
above panels from <em>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth</em>, the
suicide of a man in a Superman suit is recorded not in the continuous
tracking of his fall, but in the presentation of a before and after sequence.
Subtle changes in the composition of the panels—a car moves out of the frame,
the cyclist moves on, some people move forward, the red and blue figure move
from top of the building to the pavement—suggest the passage of time.
Moreover, the positioning of the figures in the frame suggest varying degrees
of acknowledgment and attention. What the frames capture is silence and
stasis, two of the main thematic elements of <em>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest
Kid on Earth</em>. The static and unchanging art, then, stands in for Jimmy
Corrigan’s static and unchanging identity.

	Another aesthetic metaphor is represented through Bruce Bechdel’s
superhuman power to “spin garbage… into gold.” While certainly his skills at
making something good out of something lousy reflect an ongoing metaphor in
the novel about Bruce’s coping mechanism for an unfulfilled life in a
heterosexual prison, the art does not represent the “garbage” and the “gold”
any differently. Both appear in the same blue and white palette, with the
same artistic signature of Alison Bechdel. This approach reinforces Bruce’s
own dissatisfaction with his attempts to turn garbage into gold: they are
ultimately unsuccessful, the do not help him cope, and the world remains
coloured by the pressure of his repressed identity.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/
bruce_bechdel_begins_01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-129"

src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/
bruce_bechdel_begins_01.jpg" alt="" width="503" height="803" /></a> That “He
was an alchemist of appearance, a savant of surface, a Daedalus of décor” is
a further nod to his command of surface representations. Indeed, Daedalus
curses his own creations, and laments that they are the cause for all his
strife. The aesthetic metaphors plays out further when one considers Alison
Bechdel’s artistic signature. The drawing is neither “realistic” nor
inadequate. In fact, the art itself further suggests the issues of surface
representation, which can never hope to capture the complex depths of a
character’s identity.

	To this end, note Bechdel’s fractured head when her character confronts
her father’s corpse. Disengaged from all the surface elements that identified
her father, she resorts to finding another marker that will identify him.
Neither the mark, nor the “revealed” Bruce Bechdel are apparent in Alison
Bechdel’s artwork. However, the psychological shock of her father’s corpse is
represented through the divided head, which is disassembled by the gutter. <p
style="text-align: center;"><a

src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/
bruce_bechdel_begins_03.jpg" alt="" width="455" height="221" /></a></p> The
fractured representation of a central character is a common artistic trope
for characters who are wrestling with repressed or emergent identities.
Returning to <em>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth</em>, we see Jimmy
divided across three panels by Chris Ware. Occurring at the moment he
confronts his sister in the hospital, the page and panels suggest levels of
irony and emotional resonance not present in the words, or indeed the
narrative itself. The ironic referentiality of Jimmy’s sniffling nose,
Superman sweatshirt and fractured leg evokes the juvenile nature of Jimmy’s
identity and the “unsuperness” of his character. As well, the panels, which
fracture Jimmy’s body, also end at his fractured leg, further reinforcing his
broken identity. Moving across the page, the panels frequently juxtapose
Jimmy and his sister emphasizing similarities and oppositions. While their
may well be racial—or colour (red / blue)—differences, the emotional
resonance of the situation transcends. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/
jimmy_corrigan_begins_01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-126"

src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/
jimmy_corrigan_begins_01.jpg" alt="" width="569" height="285" /></a>
Again, Ware’s artistic signature slows down the action in order to have the
reader assemble and reassemble the situation in which Jimmy finds himself.
The reader takes part in the same mental gymnastics of comprehension that
Jimmy himself is going through. Like Jimmy, the reader struggles to make
sense of the situation and to make sense of Jimmy’s emotional state. In
short, through the aesthetic metaphors in the panels above, the reader
actively participates in the identity crisis that preoccupies Jimmy Corrigan.
The visual cues push the reader to engage actively in reassembling the broken
character—be it Jimmy Corrigan, or Bruce Bechdel.

	Finally, the artistic elements noted above can be brought together to
emphasize or exaggerate the reader’s stake in a character’s identity. Perhaps
the best encapsulation of the kind of dominant fractured identity we have
been discussing is one of Batman’s arch nemeses: Harvey Dent, or “Two-Face.”
One of the more innovative manoeuvres of Frank Miller’s <em>Batman: The Dark
Knight Returns</em> is his breaking of the expectations of the genre. Miller
frequently erases panel lines, eliminates gutters, and complicates the logic
of the pagespace in order to emphasize elements of a character’s identity. In
the example below, we are introduced to the supposedly reformed Two-Face.
Zooming in on Arkham Asylum, we are first greeted by The Joker in room 601,
as we pass to room 602—by no accident an even number; where The Joker is odd,
Harvey is at least “even”—the representation of Harvey Dent is split over two
panels by a gutter. Dividing the conversation of the short and tall doctors,
and metaphorically insinuating Harvey’s still-fractured psyche, the gutter
makes the reader reassemble Harvey into the villain s/he knows. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/
two_face_begins.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-128"
title="two_face_begins"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/
two_face_begins.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="732" /></a> The reader’s
reconstruction of Harvey Dent and the panel’s eventual merging to represent
an obscured, “cured,” Two-Face creates a tension in what the artist
represents and what the reader performs. Like the two doctors, the reader
consistently works to repair the fractured character represented in the
narrative. The reader’s reconstruction of the character, fractured by the
story-teller’s reliance on memory, masks, and metaphor is the ultimately
salvation of the character’s identity.

	Like Bruce Bechdel, the author of the graphic narrative represents a
fractured or obscured version of reality—one which answers to the
expectations of the craft. <a

bruce_bechdel_begins_02.jpg" alt="" width="447" height="712" /></a>
Indeed, the role of the artist in representing character in the graphic novel
is as a Daedalus-like figure who is constantly both inventing and
disassembling labyrinths of identity, history, and
narrative.]]>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[While the graphic
narrative for the most part has its roots in the forward-thinking mythologies
of science-fiction, the medium is nonetheless dominated by memoir, the
re-telling of tales told, and after-the-fact reportage. In particular, longer
graphic narratives, those which have come to be called graphic novels, are
dominated by the narrative structures of the memoir and detective fiction,
both of which involve the recounting of an already played-out scenario. Both
Will Eisner's  <em>A Contract with God</em> and Art Spiegelman's
Pulitzer-Prize-winning <em>Maus </em>are memoir--in the case of the latter a
second-hand memoir--while Frank Miller's re-imagining of the
superhero-detective Batman in <em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</em> and
the detective epic <em>Watchmen</em> by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons evolve
through an unravelling of entwined narrative moments. In short, a medium
which often responds to the optimism and anxieties of the future is often
steeped in a deep-seated reckoning with the past.

	At the same time, the vast majority of characters in graphic
narratives are dealing with their pasts or issues associated with the past.
Alison Bechdel tries to make sense of both her father's and her own past;
Spiegelman grapples with the Holocaust and his own relationship with his
father; Jimmy Corrigan sets out on a crusade to find his missing father, and
family heritage; Bruce Wayne wrestles awkwardly with retirement in
<em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</em>; the characters in <em>Watchmen</em>
reckon with pasts both their own and of others. Even Superman is ultimately
dealing with being an orphan on a strange planet eking out a renewed history
because he has lost his own. Perhaps the most evident example of an artist /
author grappling with narratives of the past is Art Speigelmen's direct
address to the guilt he begins to feel about the success of his graphic novel
<em>Maus</em>. Rendering himself literally drawing on the backs of his
executed ancestors, Spiegelman recognizes that his heritage--and the horrors
associated with it--is at once providing a story / narrative sequence and
increasingly forcing his "present" self to confront the diverse meanings and
interpretations his aesthetic creates for that heritage. In other words, as
he investigates his past--or more appropriately, his parents' past--the story
draws to a close and there is less and less to feed his creativity as his
aesthetically original cat / mouse / dog / pig metaphors play themselves out.

	<a

maus_spiegelman_bodies.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-149"

src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/
maus_spiegelman_bodies.jpg" alt="" width="528" height="749" /></a>The image
above suggests other possible interpretations. For instance, the image
invokes the millions of dead stories that went nowhere--that just stopped
dead--upon which Spiegelman is building his own narrative. In a sense,
Spiegelman is writing out the futures of all these dead souls through his
encounters with his father’s survival narrative.

	Of course, the central point here is that Spiegelman does not tell his
father's story, or his mother's (lost in her death and missing diary), but
the story of his own revelation <em>about</em> his father's story. The
story--if it can be charitably called that--of the holocaust has been told
many times and many ways, Spiegelman's re-telling is in <em>his</em>
interpretation of it--and this is where the reader's attention and interest
lie.

	On the other hand, Will Eisner simply announces that he is telling
stories already told: <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/
eisner_contract_preface.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-148"
title="eisner_contract_preface"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/
eisner_contract_preface.jpg" alt="" width="499" height="803" /></a> The
tenements give Eisner an opportunity to share <em>his</em> vision of
childhood through his aesthetic--one often identified as the pinnacle of New
York comics. The stories in <em>Contract with God</em> are not Eisner's but
told through Eisner who fills in the aesthetic details and renders the
overheard narratives tangible.

	Indeed, every non-superhero graphic narrative we have dealt with so far
works its narrative through memory and revelation (the detective narrative):
<em>Fun Home: A Family Tragicomedy</em> and <em>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest
Kid on Earth</em>. The analysis gets a little more complicated when we move
to investigate graphic narratives involving superheroes. Given that superhero
narratives are not have--at their base--the biographical influence of the
graphic novels discussed above, it might seem less relevant to examine the
role of temporality in the narrative. However, as mentioned above, given the
medium's roots in science fiction, its reliance on narratives of the past and
particularly the structures of mythology demands attention.

	Any mention of graphic narrative and mythology calls to mind Umberto
Eco’s essay "The Myth of Superman." It's worth noting how his theoretical
approach to understanding Superman's temporality confirms the overwhelming
presence of the past in the structures the underlie the medium. Speaking to
Superman’s dual identity as both "mild-mannered" Clark Kent and Superman, Eco
notes that "In terms of narrative, Superman's double identity has a function
since it permits the suspense characteristic of a detective story and great
variation in the mode of narrating our hero's adventures, his ambiguities,
his histrionics" (Eco 15). In other words, we can delve into the back-stories
of two characters, who nonetheless share the same body. The
medium--particularly in the superhero genre’s dual identity
structures--relies on a narrative that fills in the details of a character’s
past.

	Continuing his line of analysis, Eco argues that "Such a character will
take on what we will call an 'aesthetic universality,' a capacity to serve as
a reference point for behaviour and feelings which belong to us all. He does
not contain the universality of myth, nor does he become an archetype, the
emblem of a supernatural reality. He is the result of a universal rendering
of a particular and eternal event. The character of a novel is a 'historic
type.' Therefore, to accommodate this character, the aesthetics of the novel
must revive an old category particularly necessary when art abandons the
territory of myth; this we may term the 'typical'" (Eco 15). Eco’s nod to the
"typical" here calls to mind the overwhelming "typicalness" of characters
such as Jimmy Corrigan who, while toying radically with the tropes of the
superhero narrative, nevertheless feature individuals who are more typical
than heroic, more wrapped in their past than in their present. In short,
because the superhero narrative does not provide a archetypal or mythological
model for the medium, creativity can focus on the typical or, more precisely,
the mythology of the typical wherein readers are directed to journey while
the lives of typical individuals are revealed through a structure more
responsive to the transmutable identities (often secret) of superheroes. Gone
is the mythological hero who arrives fully formed as a model for the Just
life, and whose adventures serve to reinforce his moral justness. In its
place is the empty shell of a typical individual whose identity is revealed
through the gradual revelation of minutiae which may or may not justify that
individual’s reason for being.

	Furthermore, "The mythological character of comic strips finds himself in
this singular situation: he must be an archetype, the totality of certain
collective aspirations, and therefore, he must necessarily become immobilized
in an emblematic and fixed nature which renders him easily recognizable (this
is what happens to Superman); but since he is marketed in the sphere of a
‘romantic’ production for a public that consumes 'romances,' he must be
subjected to a development which is typical, as we have seen, of novelistic
characters" (Eco 15). The characters and narratives of the graphic narrative
are therefore representative of our "collective aspirations"--that we all
possess the potential to be Superman, or the potential to examine our pasts
with the insight of someone like Bechdel--but fixed within a fairly
simplistic revelatory structure that involves the constant "filling in" of
missing details.

	In his explanation of this structure of character and narrative
development, Eco argues that "Superman's script writers have devised a
solution which is much shrewder and undoubtedly more original. The stories
develop in a kind of oneiric climate--of which the reader is not aware at
all--where what has happened before and what has happened after appears
extremely hazy. The narrator picks up the strand of the event again and again
as if he had forgotten to say something and wanted to add details to what had
already been said" (Eco 17). Indeed, the lazy critic of the graphic narrative
could quickly offer that every story in the medium is essentially a retelling
of a genesis narrative, one that has its roots in the historical structures
of Western story-telling. However, Eco's continued analysis provides insight
into how we might interpret the overwhelming presence of historiography in
the graphic narrative: <blockquote>It occurs, then, that along with Superman
stories, Superboy stories are told, that is, stories of Superman when he was
a boy, or a tiny child under the name of Superbaby. At a certain point,
Supergirl appears on the scene. She is Superman's cousin and she, too,
escaped from the destruction of Krypton. All of the events concerning
Superman are retold in one way or another in order to account for the
presence of this new character (who has hitherto not been mentioned, because,
it is explained, she has lived in disguise in a girls' school, awaiting
puberty, at which time she could come out into the world; the narrator goes
back in time to tell in how many and in which cases she, of whom nothing was
said, participated during those many adventures where we saw Superman alone
involved). One imagines, using the solution of travel through time, that
Supergirl, Superman's contemporary, can encounter Superboy in the past and be
his playmate; and even Superboy, having broken the time barrier by sheer
accident, can encounter Superman, his own self of many years later. (Eco
17)</blockquote> In other words, the true power of the medium is how open it
is to retelling and renewal. While the scaffolding may be similar, the
aesthetics consistently rework external appearances--an apt way of
understanding the dual identities at work in the Superhero who is both
“super” and "typical"; "surface" and "secret." As Eco concludes, "In Superman
stories the time that breaks down is the _time of the story_, that is, the
notion of time which ties one episode to another. In the sphere of a story,
Superman accomplishes a given job (he routs a band of gangsters); at this
point the story ends. In the same comic book, or in the edition of the
following week, a new story begins" (Eco 17). Indeed, it may well be that the
episodic foundations of the medium encourage an aesthetics that revisits and
reconsiders its subject-matter. At the same time, however, the medium is
acutely aware of its own repetitive tendencies, and its aesthetics,
structures, tropes, and characters continually offer a self-referential
glance at the medium’s limits. In fact, the vast majority of the successful
graphic narratives delve headlong into the limits of representation,
particularly if that representation entails the repeated revelation of secret
identities, or narrative histories. The strength is not necessarily in the
originality of the tale, but in the originality of the re-telling. Far from
being forward-thinking or metaphoric of technological or scientific
anxieties, the supernatural characteristics of the medium’s characters and
narratives are merely smokescreens for the aesthetics of re-telling, merely
ways of manipulating echoes from the past. The story has already been told,
it’s the details we’re interested in exploring and it’s the details that
receive the most direct aesthetic attention.

	Even a character like Sherlock Holmes, a man of details and supernatural
cranial powers, has his stories told through the after-the-fact reportage of
Watson, who bears out the revelatory process, the conclusion to which, he
already knows.

sherlock_holmes_09.jpg" alt="" width="274" height="337" /></a>In the end,
what gets revealed are not the superpowers or the moral fortitude, but the
slow revelation of the superhero's character  flushed out by trips back in
time, through the consistent re-telling of stories told, and the ever-present
after-the-fact reportage. A typical character shows us a typical story of a
typical event in an extraordinary way. In comic books, despite the
super-natural, super-mechanical, or super-atomic causations, everything has
already happened. All that's left is to reveal the unlimited intricacies of
character, or to embellish the narrative.]]>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[The most interesting
graphic narratives emphasize the problem of trying to see something that
cannot be seen, where rather than being worth a thousand words, a picture is
no substitute for any number of words, as it testifies to something missing.
Thus the “crude,” “primitive,” “impoverished” art of the cartoon engages with
the sublime: the overwhelming concept that has no representation.

	In <em>Fun Home</em> Alison dreams of leading Bruce up a
wooded hill to see perfect sunset. In the dream, however, Bruce is too late
and misses the image. What we see is a blankness, as if Bechdel had taken her
eraser to the page to “undraw” nothing.  This is an allegorical dream moment
because homosexuality is a sublime concept for Bruce, something that cannot
be represented. For Alison, because of her ability to be “out” and “open,” it
is beautiful, everywhere expressible. Alison gets to see the image, while
Bruce sees only empty space.

	In <em>Ghost World,</em> hints of a world elsewhere abound, from the
graffiti of the title (Enid sees the phantom tagger disappearing out of frame
in one instance), to the name “Norman” (which we can easily and appropriately
shorten to “Norm”) etched in the sidewalk over and over again, to a pair of
abandoned pants in the street. These surpluses signify a deficit: who is
leaving these signs lying around in the world? The signs culminate in the bus
out of town on the cancelled line that carries Enid away at the end of the
narrative. Clowes keeps us guessing as to whether the world that we see drawn
in the frames is “Ghost World” or the unseen world that is pointed to but
never shown.

In <em>Jimmy
Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth</em>, Chris Ware draws frame after frame
of scenery, and empty world with no people in it. Our eyes are drawn into the
frame and the effect is a synaesthetic one: silence. No words, just images of
space that create a tension, a need to be populated. The page keeps asking
us, “what are you looking at?” <em>Jimmy Corrigan</em> produces the effect of
simultaneously being jam packed and empty. The frames are shrunk down so we
have to squint to see them. Several pages are filled with tiny, almost
unreadable text. Ware appears to be working “around” something that can be
neither written nor drawn. Thought of in the terms of literary criticism,
<em>Jimmy Corrigan</em> fits the bill of Umberto Eco’s “open” text, or Roland
Barthes’ “writerly” text--the kind of book that resists cooptation by its
reader and refuses to be “about anything,” that refuses to be “transparent”
or to have its machinery appear invisible as the plot works its magic.
<em>Jimmy Corrigan</em> challenges the reader to to see the “nothing” that it
is about. Or to put it another way, the book tells us that no matter how much
we can see, we are still missing something. Jimmy Corrigan’s quest to find
his father in Michigan echoes Ahab’s quest to kill the white whale in
<em>Moby-Dick </em>to eradicate the whiteness, the bar on vision, the screen
that stands between us and the perception of reality, truth. And just as
Ishmael’s discursive commentary weaves thousands of words around that
whiteness, undercutting Ahab’s linear quest, Ware’s drawing weaves hundreds
of images that counter Jimmy’s hope for familial resolution.

shape-shifting “mask”  throws onto the reader (viewer?) the responsibility
for making sense of the blot; Ernesto in Jason Lutes’ <em>Jar of Fools</em>
whose face is often left blank, making him look like a rag doll; Clark Kent’s
glasses that render Superman invisible--these are all examples of the graphic
narrative reminding its readers of the precariousness of seeing. What you see
is not what you get, but, paradoxically, what you don’t
get.]]>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[David Mazzucchelli,
author of <em>Asterios Polyp</em>, drew for <em>Daredevil</em> and
<em>Batman</em> for DC so he well-knows the terrain of superheroes and secret
identities. At first glance, <em>Asterios Polyp</em>,  the story of an
architect, has little to do with masked figures.  Nevertheless, Asterios’
story is haunted by doubleness and an identity  schism; it is narrated by his
twin brother, Ignazio, who was still-born.  The narrative structure of
<em>Asterios Polyp</em> is a curious one: Asterios is presented, drawn, and
discussed, but he  rarely speaks for himself, in brief speech bubbles. The
narrator,  meanwhile, is the source of Asterios’ trauma, unseen by Asterios
except  in fantasy or dream.

 Ignazio’s death has left in his life. Everything in Asterios’ work as an 
architect testifies to this absence. His buildings are all twinned 
structures, and Asterios expresses pleasure at the twin towers of the  World
Trade Center: “The brilliance of it is that there are two of them”  (112).
But Asterios is a “paper architect,” which means that his  buildings exist
only as drawings; none of them have ever been built. The  implication is that
the absence of Ignazio not only inspires these twin  structures but also
prevents them from becoming real. The buildings are  impossible.

	<a

295x300.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="300" /></a>

	Also  impossible for Asterios is a relationship. In spite of the hole in
his  life, Asterios is too full of himself, compensating perhaps for his 
lack. He is egotistical and vain. He marries a sculptor, Hana  Sonnenschein,
but appears unable to give her equal billing in his life.  When she finds
success designing sets for the choreographer, Willy  Illium, he grows
jealous. We might say that just as the super-hero’s  alter ego puts a spanner
in the works of his or her romantic life,  Asterios’ absent twin does the
same for him. The marriage breaks up and  Asterios finds himself stranded,
once again “split up.”

	In  the opening sequence of frames, Asterios is dissolute, 
post-relationship with Hana. His apartment is in disarray: plants are  dead
or dying; bottles, food remains, and newspapers are scattered  across the
living room. A stack of overdraft notices and unpaid bills  lies beside the
old-fashioned telephone. He is unshaven on his bed  watching a sex tape,
flicking a Zippo lighter. A lightning strike hits  his apartment building and
the ensuing fire destroys everything he has,  as if it were an apocalyptic
erasure of his current life: the death of  his old world and the birth of a
new one.He escapes the building with  the clothes on his back, a Zippo
lighter, a Swiss army knife, and a  watch. On his fiftieth birthday, Asterios
Polyp is suddenly a tabula rasa, or at least the illusion of a tabula rasa. 
He escapes New York City for a fictional town called Apogee, whose name 
tells us that Asterios is at the furthest point from whatever it is he  is
orbiting: the traumatic kernel of his twinship.  He gives up  architecture to
become an auto mechanic and takes up with the garage  owner’s family.

	Like  many literary apocalypses, Asterios’ is a failed one. Even at the 
farthest point from his identity center, alterity continues to haunt  him.
Stiffly, the garage owner, calls him “Stereo” and Stiffly’s son,  Running
Dog, has an alter ego of his own in an imaginary friend,  mimicking Asterios’
dilemma. Asterios can get far away from his  existential crisis, but there is
no doubt that he is still bound by its  orbit. A pivotal moment occurs when
Asterios loses an eye when he is  attacked in a bar. The loss of his eye
affects his depth perception  through parallax or stereopsis. His “twin”
vision is no longer possible;  he becomes a cyclops. While lying in hospital,
Asterios dreams that he  drives his smoking Saab into the Apogee garage to
find Ignazio working  there. As Ignazio recounts his story, which is
Asterios’ story, Asterios  gets angrier and angrier and strikes him with a
wrench. He feels that  his dead twin is not only mirroring him but mocking
him. When he’s well  enough, Asterios drives to Minnesota (the Twin Cities)
for a reunion  with Hana.

	The secret identity of the super hero, when seen through the lens of
<em>Asterios Polyp</em>,  perhaps testifies to an inherent “otherness” of the
self, a self  elsewhere, that can be either idealized or diminished,
depending on the  psychological disposition of the subject. The superhero’s
appeal  lies  in the possibility of being something or someone else. But
maybe we are  always someone else whenever we look in the mirror or even just
think  about ourselves. Just as Asterios wonders if he is somehow living 
Ignazio’s life, we might wonder if we are living someone else’s life, or  at
least a life not our own. We don’t need to have had a still-born  twin to
“shadowed” like Asterios is. Furthermore, <em>Asterios Polyp</em> suggests
that in spite of all our efforts to disavow this otherness, it  may be
inevitable. Just as Asterios appears to have abandoned his  double vision or
parallax for a more humble unity, a meteorite hurtles  towards Hana’s house
as Asterios sits with her in her living room.]]>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, so this post is even further delayed than I
expected. I began this post on November 12.

	I am presenting the days of the <a
href="http://www.institutofranklin.net/en">Instituto Franklin</a> comics
conference in Alcala in a messed up order because I have been too busy
attending panels to post anything about day 2. As day 3 remains fresh in my
mind,  I'll return to day 2 when I have more leisure. From my perspective,
the last day was perhaps the best for me in terms of developing my own
understanding of how comics work.



	The early morning "Theory" session featured <a
href="http://castle.eiu.edu/agora/Dec03/Kuipall.htm">Chris Kuipers</a>, a
fellow alumnus from the University of California, Irvine, arguing that the
graphic novel as the latest "royal genre," following on from the novel and
the epic in "Epic, Roman, Graphic Novel: Three Royal Genres". A "royal" genre
governs the way literature is thought about in any particular era, embodying
the technology of the period, which is partly responsible for its
transformation and incorporation of previous genres. The comic's engagement
with web technology is a component of its potential for dominance. <a
href="http://www.iup.edu/page.aspx?id=58879">Kuipers</a> pointed out that
"graphic novel" is a weak term for this kind of text; it is a term trying to
gain credibility from a past genre, and does not adequately represent what
long form comics are.

	<a href="http://psychology.stanford.edu/btversky">Barbara Tversky</a>, a
cognitive psychologist from Stanford, presented a fascinating talk ("Aspects
of Depictions in Graphic Narratives") about how comics are perceived in terms
of action and complexity, dependent on culture. Her discussion started with
visual (iconic?) instructions, such as a blow-up diagram and instructions on
how to put together a bookshelf, and related how the mind processes them to
the way it processes a comic.

	Nicolas Thiessen, in "You Don't Know How to Read a Comic" took issue with
formalist approaches to reading comics, suggesting that the intuited pattern
of moving from left to right and top to bottom was in no way a necessity. His
argument hinged on the Heideggerian notion of equipment, which has no
existence as equipment separate from its use. Likewise, form does not inhere
in a comic, but rather is imposed on it through our reading of it.

	Perhaps my favorite presentation from a session on experimental narrative
was <a
href="http://www.informationenvironments.org.uk/research-projects.html">Ian
Horton</a> on  "Information Design, Experimental Comic Books, and Narrative
Form." Again, Ikea and Habitat instructions played their role in getting at
how comics work. He then moved on to Will Eisner's comics instructions for
the US army to address issues of complexity and functionality in these
instructions. Horton challenged the notion that representing instructions
visually through comics does not necessarily simplify matters.  H then
discussed Chris Ware's Acme Novelty Library #20, popularly known as
<em>Lint</em> to show the elements of information design that Ware has
incorporated into his overtly aestheticized work.

	The keynote, and closing, speech of the day was <a
href="http://www.csun.edu/~ch76854/">Charles Hatfield</a> appraising the
state of independent comics in 2011. Hatfield used four examples: Adrian
Tomine's latest issue of <em>Optic Nerve</em> , the latest issue of the
Hernandez brothers Love and Rockets, a licensed <em>Simpsons</em> property,
<em>Treehouse of Horror</em>, and an experimental comics broadsheet,
<em>Pood</em>. Hatfield discussed the impact of large publishing companies
like Bertelsmann and MacMillan taking on Drawn and Quarterly and
Fantagraphics titles, the diminishing power of the direct market comics shop
model, and the way that "graphic novels" as long form "high end" texts have
perhaps eclipsed the "floppy," as the slim, soft-covered, stapled comic is
commonly known. As what was formerly been independent has been co-opted by
the mainstream, Hatfield, sees mini comics and webcomics as the new
inhabitants of the independent realm.

	In giving synopses of these talks, I am sure that I have distorted them.
In order to correct that distortion, you should seek out the published
versions of these papers which are sure to come out.]]>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[At long last, I report on my second day at the <a
href="http://pepoperez.blogspot.com/2011/11/el-congreso.html"><em>First
International Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels</em></a> in Alcala de
Henares, Spain. These are, of course, just highlights from my perspective.
And I invite any correction to my presentation of these talks.

	Pedro Moura, "A Typology of Experimentation in Comics"

	Moura presented a fascinating tour through the various manifestations of
avant garde, non-narrative comics.  Moura follows Deleuze and Guattari in
seeking an absolutely deterritorialized comics, a minor comics. That is, he
is not interested in comics that "experiment" only to re-assert conventional
storytelling and meaning. Rather, he seeks a kind of comic that is only
comic, not a vehicle for narrative content.

	Thomas Byers, "Comix Theory: The Justice League of Europe's Attack on
Deconstruction"

	Byers presented a critique of phallic displacement in a little-known DC
comic in which the Justice League of Europe, under the temporary leadership
of Batman, take on "Deconstructo" a villain who espouses a kind of aesthetic
nihilism and relativism. Byers reads the comic as a typical attack on
deconstruction, aligning it with the New York Times' notorious obituary for
Jacques Derrida. Byers turns the comic on its head, revealing its anxiety
over the loss of the phallus. He justified the Lacanian turn in his argument
because of the way that all theory tends to be lumped together in the eyes of
its detractors.

	Jose Alaniz, "Czech Comics Anthropology: Life and Story in Keva"

	Alaniz discussed the project of ASTA SME which combines comics and
anthropology. <em>Keva</em> is one volume in a trilogy focusing on the Roma
in the Czech republic. Keva is the youngest and most integrated of the three
subjects. The novel element of this comic is the way it engages with the life
of the subject. For instance, the authors asked Keva how she wished to be
drawn in the text. Her response was a composite of pop culture icons. She
wanted the legs of Mariah Carey, for instance. Alaniz referred to this kind
of text as a "negotiated story," in which the subject participates in his or
her construction.  Alaniz discussed the range of drawing styles in the book,
from cartoony to something approaching photo-realism. This range demonstrates
the power of comics to "comment" on the content under representation. The
talk was fascinating, and <em>Keva</em> is probably worth picking up even
though it has not been translated into English.

	Simon Grennan, "Demonstrating Discours: Two Comic Strip Projects in Self
Constraint"

	Grennan's main point was that comics narratology has focused on
"histoire," what is told, rather than "discours," the putting into action of
the story, or the "telling to."  Grennan used a page from Seth's <em>Clyde
Fans</em> and Mike Madden's <em>99 Ways to Tell A Story</em>. Each of these
texts works with a constraint. Seth restricts himself to the temporal and
stylistic conventions of the <em>New Yorker</em> magazine, with nothing
appearing that is not "American" or post 1960, while Madden writes the same
story over and over again according to different generic principles. Grennan
argued that Seth's work made sense in terms of discours, while Madden's
simply repeated his own style over and over again. In other words, Seth's
working within the constraint works, while Madden's doesn't because
"discours" contradicts "histoire," particularly in the version of his story
that employs the fantasy genre.]]>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Thursday Feb.
14, 2013 - Owly and Wormy Teach Us to Read</strong>

	A recent trip to that icon of comicshops <a
href="http://www.beguilingbooksandart.com/">The Beguiling</a> in Toronto and
its sister store <a href="http://www.littleislandcomics.com/sample-page/"
target="_blank">Little Island Comics</a>—apparently North America’s first
comicshop for kids—introduced me to the books of <a
href="http://www.amazon.ca/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=
390961&amp;field-author=Andy%20Runton&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;search-alias=books
-ca&amp;tag=thedigcullab-20">Andy Runton</a>. He writes / draws a fantastic
series called <a href="&lt;a href=">Owly &amp; Wormy</a>. The books contain
virtually no words, instead relying on a sequence of events and the
character’s expressionism to carry the story forward. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-2.png"><img
class="aligncenter  wp-image-2338" title="photo 2"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-2.png" alt=""
width="461" height="614" /></a> The books struck me immediately as an
example of something Peter and I have been pushing for some time: the
argument that comics require an education in reading as much as text does,
maybe even moreso. What Runton’s books also make apparent is how reading is,
at its base, a creative activity; reading is generative. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-3.png"><img
class="aligncenter  wp-image-2339" title="photo 3"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-3.png" alt=""
width="461" height="614" /></a> While the basic narrative of the Owly and
Wormy books would be the same for everyone, the intricacies of the story
would not. Runton’s books force the reader of his books to both interpret and
create what’s on the page. When I read the books to my two-year-old, I have
to come up with the words. When my five-year-old reads the book without me,
he comes up with an entirely different set of words and emotions to go with
the image sequence. Everything is in play: the white space is there to be
filled. What’s amazing about the way one encounters Runton’s books is the
manner in which we write the story based on the pictures. 
<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-4.png"><img
class="aligncenter  wp-image-2340" title="photo 4"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-4.png" alt=""
width="461" height="614" /></a> Reading Runton means reading for signs of
character emotion, clues for sequence, and generally interpreting what images
Runton has put down on the page. However, reading here also involves making
decisions about what language might be added to describe, augment, and
accelerate the sequence of images that form the story. There are spaces where
language is needed, but not always. Runton’s books really make you account
for the silences in comics and for the amount of work an image can do on its
own, without language. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-7.png"><img
class="aligncenter  wp-image-2341" title="photo 7"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-7.png" alt=""
width="461" height="614" /></a> The value in Runton’s books is in how
they teach us how to read and make reading into a self-reflective practice.
What becomes apparent is how valuable comics are in teaching people the
skills needed to read with depth. By making reading into both an interpretive
and a creative act (both occurring at the same time even), Runton forces us
to engage with the page in a way we often avoid. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-8.png"><img
class="aligncenter  wp-image-2342" title="photo 8"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-8.png" alt=""
width="461" height="614" /></a>  Runton makes us better readers. Comics
make us better readers. The amount of work that goes into interpreting and
creating Runton’s work is in some ways ruined by the imposition of language.
Where language and text tend to lock down interpretation, images merely rein
it in a little; the image doesn’t signify pure abstraction, it <em>is</em>
something, but the intricacies of what it signifies are left to the able
reader.]]>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[What's our relationship
to the author(s) of a graphic narrative? More precisely how much trust is
involved in our interpretation of the author's representation? While these
questions certainly reek with the beginnings of a 1980's theory conversation,
they point to an interesting sidebar to the act of reading a graphic
narrative: we tend to think the meaning is obvious. And why wouldn't we think
the meaning's obvious? There are pictures after all. If the reader is
confused by the text, she can look at the image for clarification. If she
vexed by the image, the reader can look to the text for explanation. What's
interesting is how this sense of certainty in the reader's ability to
interpret meaning can lead her to overlook some narrative conflicts in the
telling of the tale.



	Let's take as an example Art Spiegelman's acclaimed graphic narrative
<em>Maus</em>. As it explores the experiences of Spiegelman's father during
the holocaust, the novel also explores the relationship between the father
telling the tale and the son who is retelling the tale being told in graphic
form. One of the things readers come to expect when we encounter a memoir
such as Spiegelman's is verisimilitude; we want to believe the stories are
faithfully rendered--especially when those stories deal with a difficult
subject such as the holocaust. Unlike pure fiction, we expect the memoir to
be true, or at least "true enough." For better or worse, as we immerse
ourselves in the narrative of the memoir, we tend to forget that the memoir,
like the picture it paints, is often constructed, put together, reassembled.

	<em>Maus</em> opens with diversion, and it's a telling moment in the
story. It represents the first moment where the reader can pinpoint a
breakdown between the story Vladek is telling and the story Spiegelman is
drawing on the page. The first chapter in <em>Maus</em>, "The Sheik," focuses
on Vladek's early life before the holocaust, what Vladek deems a private
moment. For Vladek, the story is clearly the holocaust, not him. However,
Spiegelman has other motivations that creep into the rendering of his
father's tale. The first hint that Spiegelman may not be representing his
father's accounts accurately comes when Spiegelman draws Vladek on a bicycle
saying he "looked just like Rudolph Valentino." <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Maus_shiek.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-209" title="Maus_shiek"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Maus_shiek.jpg
" alt="" width="226" height="341" /></a> To most readers, the comment is read
as an exaggeration of Vladek's handsomeness and Spiegelman's drawing of the
old man hunched over his stationary bike, cycling, doesn't help confirm the
reader's sense that Vladek is exaggerating. Right away readers are
positioned, by virtue of how and what Spiegelman is showing us, to question
the accuracy of Vladek's story-telling and the extent to which it is
"true." Another instance of Spiegelman's
manipulation of his father's account comes at the end of the diversion. After
Vladek asks his son not tell the story in his comic book, Spiegelman promises
not to tell the story: <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Maus_1_021.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-206" title="Maus_1_021"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Maus_1_021.jpg
" alt="" width="304" height="448" /></a>Of course, the story has already been
told at this point, and the broken promise revealed to the reader. Again, the
reader is forced to question the relationship between the story as it was
told (Vladek's story) and how it is being told to the reader (Spiegelman's
story). Suddenly, reading the graphic narrative just got very complex; the
reader cannot help but wonder: whose story is this? And, whose images of the
past am I looking at? With great frequency throughout the novel, Spiegelman's
images contextualize--and distort--Vladek's past. The images, while certainly
heightening the visceral resonance of Vladek's holocaust narrative, still
distort the reader's reception of that narrative; this is not Vladek's story,
it is Spiegelman's. The images, rather than clarifying and illuminating the
narrative, distort the verisimilitude of Vladek's memoir. This complexity
is compounded by the nature of the subject being addressed in the memoir. The
reader is--and often rightly--reluctant to challenge the authenticity of the
Survivor's Tale. However, careful readers and good critics know that the
brutality of the subject is no reason enough to avoid delving into questions
of representation. Moreover, by including the opening chapter diversion away
from the dominant subject-matter of the novel, Spiegleman leaves the door
open for this kind of resistant interpretive questioning by the reader.

	To this end, the opening aphorism that prefaces the book offers yet
another telling juxtaposition. Quoting Hitler, the book opens with the lines
"The Jews are undoubtedly a race, but they are not human." Without question
sinister words by a madman, but words that, given Spiegelman's aesthetic
decisions rendering characters in the book, reflect the tangible reality to
follow in the creative narrative. Indeed, in <em>Maus</em>, the Jews are not
human; they're mice. Does Spiegelman's aesthetic decision to represent Jews
as mice reflect or mock Hitler's comment? What about all the other non-humans
in the novel: Germans = Cats / Poles = pigs? In short, the images Spiegelman
gives us don't really help us to comprehend or contextualize Hitler's text,
or even understand why Spiegelman put it at the beginning of his book. In
fact, Hitler's claim oddly complicates, or problematizes, the intended
meaning for text and image in the novel.

	Finally, there's the visual metaphors that play off of Vladek's
stationary bike. Tending to appear at the beginning of each of Vladek's
recollections about his Holocaust experience, the bike suggests a kind of
"spinning of wheels" and both mocks and downgrades Vladek's story-telling
while it elevates Spiegleman's. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Maus_chrono.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211" title="Maus_chrono"

Spiegelman is the artist here and the old man is just spinning tales the same
way he has told them over and over and over. At the same time, the image of
Vladek on the bike further reduces him to  character--a kind of distracted
historian who lacks the requisite  artistic capability to see the
significance and resonance of his story. Vladek is not artist or
story-teller, he is merely a survivor--his experiences reduced to the raw
material for an aesthetic experience. Unlike Spiegelman who can go in and out
of the past--visiting his father as he pleases, returning home to his
wife--Vladek is stuck in the past, destined to relive his memories. The wheel
of time is moving forward, but Vladek is not going anywhere with it. The
image of Vladek on the bike complicates the reader's reception of his
narrative and at the same time highlights the artifice involved in
reassembling Vladek's narrative; without Spiegelman's aesthetic skills, the
story would read like any other survivor tale spinning its wheels and going
nowhere. <a

" alt="" width="310" height="445" /></a>This leads us back to where we came
in. Do the images in <em>Maus </em>add or detract from the text? The answer
is they do both, and they do both in a way that demands close reading and
scrutiny for multiple meanings. The tendency to over-simplify the reading of
graphic narrative is a tendency Spiegelman exploits to pressure our
understanding and reception of a historical event kept alive in the stories
of its few remaining survivors.]]>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[The notion that an
ordinary person could become a super hero is an example of what the
psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan would call “the imaginary.” That is, it is a
fantasy of stepping out of the symbolic order to exercise mastery over the
world--the fantasy of becoming a god-like figure in other words. In Lacan’s
psychoanalytic theory, the imaginary is a realm of violence, largely because
someone always stands in the way of one’s assumption of full power: see the
Nazis' Third Reich fantasy depending on the extermination of the Jews, or the
interference of the “Indians” in the establishment of a New Canaan in
America. In superhero graphic narratives, the violent nature of the imaginary
is allayed by the superhero’s employing that violence against villainy. The
violence of the superheroes is legitimated by the fact that they use their
powers for good, not to attain tyrannical control over the world.

	The contemporary re-visions of the super
hero--<em>Watchmen</em>, <em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</em>--offer a
gimlet-eyed view of this fantasy, returning the superhero to the symbolic
order, re-establishing the “subjectification” of the superhero. It is as if
reality is clawing the superhero back into its domain.

	In fact, though, the (re)subjectification of the superhero has been part
of the story from the beginning. There is always an Achilles
heel--kryptonite, for instance--that acts as a brake on the super hero’s
power. As everyone knows, the problem with being all-powerful is that it
doesn’t make for much of a story. What does make for a good story, however,
is an exploration of the limits of the imaginary register. To what extent can
a hero can be “super” before disappearing in a puff of smoke--becoming
completely implausible even to the most willing suspender of disbelief, the
comic book reader.

	The integration of the world of superhero comics into Jonathan Lethem’s
<em>Fortress of Solitude</em>, a conventional (i.e. non-graphic) novel,
illuminates just how elastic these limits can be. Dylan Ebdus, the
protagonist of the novel, designs a suit and invents a
character--Aeroman--who flies. In the novel’s most painful moment, the
13-year-old Dylan dresses in the suit to impress his first love, Heather. The
scene is a perfect example of the imaginary hitting the wall of reality.
Nevertheless, in the novel, the wearer of the suit and the bearer of the
special ring flies. We keep waiting for the illusion to break, but it
doesn’t.

	Whatever it is flying requires--balance, poise, unhesitation, an organ
for sensing air waves--he’s apparently got. His swoop begins just below the
garage’s second story, two balled fists leading the charge as he curves from
the expected collision with the pavement, first falling aslant, then
unmistakably horizontal. (205)

	The effect is quite the opposite of reading a superhero comic book, where
we are in a receptive frame of mind regarding what the human or superhuman
individual is capable of. In <em>Fortress of Solitude</em> we wait for
reality to assert itself and when it doesn’t, our heads spin.

	The flipside of this relationship between reality and the imaginary can
be seen in Brad Bird’s animated film, <em>The Incredibles</em>, not only in
the Incredible family’s difficulties in adjusting to suburban living after
“supers” have been prohibited by law from exercising their powers, but also
in the technical details involved in designing a new costume for Mr
Incredible’s re-emergence. Edna Mode, the designer, pronounces “No Capes!”
and goes into an account of various superheros coming a cropper because they
got their capes snagged on something or other.

	<what>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M68ndaZSKa8</what>

	This intrusion of a kind of reality principle into the imaginary realm
captures our relationship to that realm, where our willing suspension of
disbelief negotiates with our concept of plausibility. We can never finally
escape our subjectification to the symbolic order and its rules, not even in
comic books.

	In non-superhero graphic narratives, the concept of the imaginary
manifests itself as a desire to fill a lack, to become complete. In<em>
Asterios Polyp</em> that means Asterios’ longing for his still-born twin
Ignazio. In <em>Ghost World</em> it means the possibility of re-inventing
oneself--escaping this world and finding another one that allows full access
to the personality one wishes. <em>Ghost World</em> is a particularly good
example because of it’s continued leaning towards a world elsewhere because
“this” world is too limiting, puts too much of a bar on subjectivity. The
point here is that fulfillment is always over the horizon, never immediately
possible.

	In spite of the fact that the superhero graphic narrative appears to
offer access to the imaginary wholeness and power that obviously fuels much
of the human imagination, the genie keeps having to be put back in the
bottle. The apparent access to power rarely brings satisfaction; rather it
comes with an attendant anxiety. As Umberto Eco is fond of saying, Superman
never gets to save the world; rather, he’s stuck with the menial task of
fighting petty crime. In fact these irritants that limit the full expression
of “superiority” turn out to be saving graces. However much we might
fantasize about flying, superhuman strength, we really want to stay on this
side of the the symbolic order. In the end, we need to know that the
imaginary is just that. Superhero graphic narratives pose the question of
“what if” we could bypass all these limitations, only to reinforce them. In
doing so they send us back to the realm of serious literature, which is all
about what it means to be subjectified within the symbolic
order.]]>


<title>#14 The Apocalypse and the Graphic Narrative</title>
<link>http://www.graphixia.ca/2011/01/the-apocalypse-and-the-graphic-
narrative/</link> <pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2011 02:49:59 +0000</pubDate>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the most common
themes in graphic narratives is the apocalypse. Usually associated with some
sort of impending doom, narratives that deal with an impending apocalypse, or
narratives that create an apocalyptic possibility, frequent our literature.
Nearly always, the central characters in Western fiction, particularly modern
English literature, are facing some kind of apocalyptic event that drives
their narrative. How these characters deal with the apocalyptic threat--or it
metaphoric equivalent--is one of the most central story-lines in modern
literature.

	<!--more-->Despite its entrenchment in the prophecies of doom, the
apocalyptic moment can signal a rebirth or renewal; it's not all bad. Often,
the apocalyptic moment sets off the narrative, creating the environment for
character and story to develop. Asterios Polyp's apartment burning down sets
the story-line in motion and creates the context for the graphic novel. In a
wonderful twist to the apocalyptic theme, the fiery decent of a renegade
earth-destroying asteroid suggests Asterios' new-found emotional clarity set
in motion by the novel's first house-burning apocalypse will end with the
novel's final, real, apocalypse. Likewise, Superman's residency on earth as a
moral crusader against petty criminals and dimensional time-travelers is set
in motion by the apocalyptic fate of Krypton. Suffice to say, not all
apocalyptic moments or threats necessarily mean the end; they can also signal
enlightenment, fortitude and renewal.

	Frank Kermode, in his book <em>The Sense of an Ending: Studies in the
Theory of Fiction</em>, argues that modern literature's obsession with
apocalyptic themes that are both positive and negative has led to the
deployment of a type of character who is always what Kermode calls "in the
middest." Characters are stuck in a kind of limbo where they fail to develop
or, fail to act in a way that represents some kind of moral lesson or
guidance. In short, the characters do not develop, but rather represent the
painstaking minutiae that are the moments between an apocalypse that
represents rebirth--the promise of emotional, physical, and intellectual
enlightenment--and the apocalypse that represents the end--the promise of an
end to emotional, physical, and intellectual pain.

	Here’s what Kermode writes to help explain his concept of the apocalypse
in modern literature: "Men, like poets, rush 'into the middest,' <em>in
medias res</em>, when they are born; they also die <em>in medias rebus</em>,
and to make sense of their span they need fictive concords with origins and
ends, such as give meaning to lives and to poems. The End they imagine will
reflect their irreducibly intermediary preoccupations. They fear it, and as
far as we can see have always done so; the End is a figure for their own
deaths" (Kermode 7).  What Kermode’s getting at here is that we rely on our
sense of what we are doing in life to understand what our deaths will be
like. In other words, we might die working, or skiing, but not because we
were zapped by an Alien's death-ray, no matter how cool that might be. We
also, argues Kermode, tend to construct our origins and endings--make-up what
makes us up and fantasize about how it will end. Given this set of
interpretive and creative circumstances, Kermode concludes that "Ideally, it
[life, narrative, character] is a wholly concordant structure, the end is in
harmony with the beginning, the middle with the beginning and end" (Kermode
6). In short, we always interpret things--from comic books to our lives--as
having a concordant and complete structure; the wrath from the sky that
begins <em>Asterios Polyp</em> reappears at the end of the novel providing a
nice continuity to the events of the story and the journey Asterios
undertakes.

	Being stuck in the middle is a peculiar condition of modern life and it
is nowhere represented better than in the characters who appear in graphic
narratives. The vast majority of the characters in graphic narratives--Jimmy
Corrigan, Vladek, Asterios, Bruce Bechdel, even Superman and Batman--are in
the process of reconstructing a past or envisioning a more promising future.
These quests for understanding and identity often guide the process through
which the story develops and, in the case of the images, the kind of
concordance the images can provide.

	In spite of its tendencies toward innovative story-lines and cutting-edge
subjects, the graphic narrative relies on the kind of “fictive concords”
Kermode identifies. On the one hand, a comic book like<em> Batman</em> always
begins in medias res, taking up a narrative long begun and reconstructing
origins as it goes along. On the other hand, a more serious graphic narrative
such as <em>Maus</em>, also enters into a long-standing narrative surrounding
memory, memoir, and history. In both cases, an apocalyptic moment launches or
sustains the narrative. At the same time, the imagery--Batman always looks
like Batman / Vladek is always on his "stationary" bike--gives the narrative
a “concordant structure” that anchors the process toward enlightenment, or
the continuing futility of coming to terms with the emotional scars that
govern our identity and actions.

	In <em>The Incredibles</em>, Edna's warning that there are to be “no
capes!” relies on the threat of a “cape apocalypse” for its resonance.
However, that same apocalyptic threat also brings about a rebirth and breath
of originality in her suit design. The apocalypse both constructs the
beginning--the capes that were--and opens the door for the future--the capes
that are no more. The stories about the capes--and the images of them—provide
continuity in an often seemingly discontinuous medium.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Speaking of apocalypse,
what if David Mazzucchelli’s Asterios Polyp allegorizes the events of the
morning of September 11, 2001 in New York City? The text provides a fair
amount of evidence for the idea: Asterios, with his “double” obsession
enthuses about the architecture of the Twin Towers; when Asterios’ building
is struck by lightning and burns, Asterios says to himself, “not again”;
whenever Asterios has a fantasy/dream sequence about his still-born twin
brother Ignazio, a plane appears on the horizon; and a huge crater occupies
the very centre of this unpaginated volume. If this is the case, Asterios’
personal apocalypse of jetisonning his past life and starting over at “ground
zero,” is woven into an American national apocalypse. But “woven into” is the
wrong metaphor, perhaps. Rather, the American apocalypse is something that we
see out of the corner of our eye as we read Asterios’ story, except when it
is staring us right in the face in the middle of the text.

jpg" alt="" width="435" height="392" /></a> Students ask legitimate questions
about the indirectness of this kind of  allegory. If a person wanted to write
a book about 9/11 why wouldn’t he  or she make it plain? Why all the hints
and innuendo? Why is the plane  off on the horizon and not smashing into a
tower? It’s not as if the  image of a plane crashing into one of the towers
is unrepresentable.  There is a comic book version of the 9/11 Report after
all. And if the  book is an allegory, it isn’t symmetrical. In the story of
the Polyp  twins, one dies at birth and the other lives, at least until
moments  after the conclusion of the text when a meteor smashes into him.
Reading  Asterios Polyp isomorphically, as a map of 9/11, proves to fraught
with  problems. And yet we cannot escape some sort of equation between this 
story of an architect whose buildings never get built and the infamous 
destruction of the World Trade center.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a

jpg" alt="" width="572" height="294" /></a></p> Allegory is a funny business.
It is difficult to say why it re-routes   what it is about through some other
story like a literary version of   Freud’s dream work, condensing and
displacing traumatic instances. Why   bother creating an equation between
what happens in the text and some   external event? And once we “get” the
allegory–”Oh, this is about   9/11”–then what? Does the story of Asterios
Polyp disappear in a puff of   smoke? Is 9/11 in any way better understood by
being put through this   process? It may be that allegory itself is
apocalyptic, dependent on   veiling and unveiling the truth, showing and
hiding in such a way as to   make readers conspiracy theorists, who gasp when
they see the “hidden”   pattern but don’t pause to think that the pattern was
never really that   hidden, and ultimately could have been stated
forthrightly in the  first  place. The better novels of Thomas Pynchon play
this game, but  the  ultimate exponent of it is Melville’s Moby-Dick, with
its constant   veiling and unveiling of the whale. Asterios Polyp, then,
participates   in a strong tradition of American literature. And this
tradition   participates in the way The United States constructs itself as an
  imagined community, both allegorical and apocalyptic: a new world; a new  
Canaan; the last, best hope of mankind.

	Mazzucchelli’s story both mimics and destabilizes this construction.  
Asterios Polyp lingers on failures of the American idea. For instance,   in a
dream/fantasy sequence, Asterios visits the Vietnam Memorial and   finds the
name of his brother Ignazio on the wall. In Apogee, on July 4,   2000, while
they watch the town Independence Day parade, Ursula Major   regales Asterios
with the history of American Indians and the way their   land was taken from
them and their culture destroyed. This  Independence  Day was, of course, the
last one before 9/11.

	When Asterios heads off to Apogee with only the clothes on his back, a  
Zippo lighter, a watch, and a Swiss Army knife, he strips himself down.   He
gives up architecture and becomes an auto mechanic. This new   beginning is a
journey into humility that opposes power, abstraction and   arrogance.
Asterios gives up one great American myth for another: the   fantasy of a
return to simplicity, where ordinary people (auto   mechanics) rather than
elite specialists (architects) hold the key to to   the ideal life.
Nevertheless, this notion of striving for humility   after a disaster has a
kind of allegorical force. Every apocalyptic   moment is an opportunity to
rethink the world and one’s place in it.   Every allegory, like the simplest
animal fable, is a chance to   re-evaluate morals and
values.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I too find that it is hard to get students to
wrap their head around allegories as explanations.  My context is the
teaching of mythology.  What I read here is a description of contemporary
mythology or, perhaps, contemporary mythologizing as a process.  These
graphic novels are 'myth-like.'

	I'm using a particular definition of myth, of course.  It's one that says
myths shouldn't be read as falsehoods.  Rather, myths transmit cultural
beliefs and values.  But, more than transmitting them, myths are used to
debate critical social issues.  Your final sentence captures it: 'every
[myth] ... is a chance to re-evaluate morals and values.'

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Further, I'd raise at this point too
			the notion that 9/11 was a conspiracy.  That mythologizing of the
			9/11 events fits perfectly within the mythological motif index
			developed years ago by Stith Thompson.  Like stories such as the
			X-Files, there is a pervasive theme in American mythology of the
			evil monster - where the government itself is the evil monster
			which holds unobtainable knowledge (divine knowledge, if you
			will).  In this case, it's the the government knowing that it was
			responsible for 9/11.  In the case of the X-Files, it's proof
			about the existence of aliens.  In the X-Files, you have a
			culture in the person of Fox Mulder.  He's the truth seeker.  The
			9/11 culture hero is harder to identify in a single person.  It
			may be in the social media collective.

	Thompson noted that evil beings restricting information from a group of
people, and a culture hero determined to get that information and/or slay the
monster, is a mythological trope found cross-culturally.

	What are the truths and values contained in this story?  The people are
always pitted against the government, I suppose.  Other themes are bound to
come to your insightful imagination.]]></wp:comment_content>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[In a review of Chester
Brown's <em>Louis Riel: A Comic-Strip Biography</em>, the Globe and Mail
argues that the book "is comics history in the making, and with it, history
never looked so good." How things look is an important part of the historical
record; optics are everything, and Brown's novel gives us plenty of optics to
get into. The comic treads ground covered by the stylistic cues we have been
discussing that mark memoir along with the narrative structure and
biographical back-story that defines the superhero genre.

	<!--more-->

	Riel--as he is portrayed by Brown--works on the reader by nesting in the
space between the superhero and what we might call the ordinary--a tight
space on a good day, just ask Clark when he squeezes into the phone booth to
change. The superhero Riel is at once the mythological figure of Canadian
history whose heroic,  but failed, attempts to lead his people to salvation
are the stuff of every Canadian history book; and the chiseled,
broad-shouldered, intellectual and political savant who deftly toils against
greater powers of evil. Of course, a key part of this interpretation of Riel
relies on a reading of Brown's drawing, which is stark, clean-lined, and
crisp when it concerns Riel and his Metis compatriots, but mocking, skewed,
and disingenuous when representing English figures such as John A. McDonald
and his elongated schnozzola.

	Elements of the ordinary, however, frequent the novel. Riel is often let
down and betrayed by others, there are few whom he can trust, and he is
ultimately faced with a foe who is stronger. Riel is not after-all created by
freak scientific accident or a displaced soul possessing extraordinary power
sent from another planet to help hapless Red Riverians; he is a "half-breed"
like the others. An alien among aliens; an ordinary man among ordinary men.
In the beginning, his one power is that he speaks English. <p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/
riel_03_brackets.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-292"

riel_03_brackets.jpg" alt="Louis Riel: &quot;I don't understand the
language.&quot; - Chester Brown" width="352" height="535" /></a></p> Of
course, as it turns out, this power of speech is what sends him down the
superheroic and mythological path. Not coincidentally, the characteristics of
bilingualism, the ability to occupy both sides of the divide, is akin to the
dual identities of the superhero: both mild-mannered and man of steel;
unassuming Clark Kent and man in blue tights.

	When Riel speaks English in the novel, he is clearly wearing his blue
tights. Brown's decision to depict Riel speaking English by dropping all his
Hs accentuates the fact that Riel is not perfectly bilingual, but like all of
us, marked by his accent. Though he may look like a white man, he does not
talk like one. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/
riel_04_dialect.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-293"

riel_04_dialect.jpg" alt="Louis Riel Dialect Scene - Chester Brown"
width="353" height="539" /></a></p> Besides having Riel drop all his Hs,
Brown also skirts the language barrier  that would hinder an understanding of
Riel's words amongst English audiences by having Riel's French rendered into
English in between &lt;&gt;. By erasing Riel's original French language,
Brown, perhaps unwittingly and in good faith, participates in exactly the
kind of cultural and political erasure that gives rise to Riel's rebellion.
Moreover, Riel's awkward English in the book evens the score for McDonald's
nose, giving Riel a flaw instantly recognizable to any English speaker.

	In closing, one of the most important facets of Riel's history, and the
graphic narrative itself, is that it ends. While Riel may embody the
characteristics of a superhero, he is nonetheless intensely mortal--an
ordinary individual. His death serves to illustrate Umberto Eco's point about
the superhero's "consumability." Arguing that superheroes cannot interact
with big, moral, real-world problems--they have to stick to petty crimes and
psychos in make-up--Eco makes a convincing case for the reader's inability to
"consume" the superhero; the superhero never dies because s/he never actually
participates in the real world. If Superman were actually to tackle poverty
and hunger, he would ultimately become all too real and his limits all too
evident.    As if to further Eco's reading, Riel is a superheroic figure who
has already been consumed because he belongs to the historical record and his
mythology is established through the numerous other re-tellings of his story.
Like Superman and the ordinary individual, Riel both lives out the same
narrative sequence over and over again, and dies. Unlike our supposed
repressed desire to be Superman,  by shedding our work-a-day clothing in
favour of a blue suit and cape, we do not want to see Riel as a figure of
escape. Riel meets his fate and is punished, again and again as the story is
re-told. Just like ordinary people who act out, Riel knows that there are
consequences to bear; no last minute escape while the villain is
"monologuing." <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/riel-05_death
.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-294" title="riel-05_death"

jpg" alt="Louis Riel Death Scene - Chester Brown" width="367" height="381"
/></a></p> That Brown knocks off the final frame of the book forces us to ask
"what's in a frame," and what historical perspective is Brown asserting by
suggesting a parallel between the end of Riel's life and the abruptly
terminated formal structure of the page? History and biography are all about
making the subject look good. Brown's portrayal of Riel suggests that "optics
are important," in culture, in politics, in history, in story, and in the
graphic narrative. <em>Louis Riel: A Comic-Strip Biography</em> seems to take
advantage of the graphic medium to tell a story that forces us to rethink how
the mythological, superheroic, and the individual are connected to the optics
of historiography.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[In <em>Louis Riel: A
Comic Strip Biography</em> Chester Brown treats his subject not just as a
political martyr but as an unconventional religious one, whose spirituality
dances with mental illness. Riel renounces Catholicism for a private
mysticism, as if he were the founder of a new religion.The cover picture of
Lous Riel: a Comic Strip Biography features Riel on a mountain top, like
Moses waiting for God's word. But inside the volume we see a difficult
character to judge because of the way Riel's public political activism
intersects with his seemingly private religious feeling. So the reader is
left wondering: Is Riel a saint? A lunatic? Or just a political figurehead?
The difficulty in answering these questions is what makes Brown’s graphic
narrative interesting. Brown doesn’t simply serve Riel up as an uncomplicated
cultural hero. Rather, he presents him as a tormented soul who cannot figure
out who he is or what he is supposed to mean.

	<!--more-->

	The arc of the story shows Riel increasingly having less interest in the
political aspects of the Metis rebellion as he becomes more self-involved,
mystical, and, perhaps, crazy. He still believes in his cause, but he seems
not as willing to pursue military and political ends. Furthermore, he has had
a spell in the asylum, having been committed for megalomania. We might think
of megalomania as a synonym for “power mad,” but that is not quite it.
Rather, he believes above all that he is right. Riel has the disease of
religious and political true believers. For a mental illness, it's pretty
heroic. <p style="text-align: left;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/
louis_riel_192.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-312"

-e1301110139548-199x300.jpg" alt="Louis Riel: Religion" width="199"
height="300" /></a> The framing of Louis Riel: A Comic Strip Biography belies
any craziness or mysticism. In fact, it suggests order and rationality. Every
page contains six frames: three rows of two, as rigidly ordered as the plots
of land that the Canadian government imposes on the Metis. The framing
suggests containment. Indeed, compared to something like David Mazzuchelli’s
Asterios Polyp which everywhere confounds comic book conventionality, Brown’s
volume is indeed a “comic strip,” sequential, ordered, almost like a
filmstrip in its unfolding.</p> This disconnect between the form of the
graphic narrative and its subject ironically illustrates the fact that Riel
cannot be contained. There is something about him that escapes framing, even
though he is continually “framed” in the sense that he is set up, falsely
accused. In fact we can see the format of the “comic-strip” as prison bars.
When Riel is tried and the background is solid black, the entrapment of the
frames becomes obvious. <p style="text-align: left;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/
louis_riel_1131.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-311"

louis_riel_1131-e1301109902309-197x300.jpg" alt="Louis Riel: In The Jail
Cell" width="197" height="300" /></a> As the narrative approaches its
conclusion, form and subject become more and more divergent. Riel becomes
difficult to comprehend. As his brothers in arms defend themselves against
the Canadians by shooting, Riel muses on the failures of the Church. He
doesn’t shoot; he just sits there. He has gone from being an iconic
representative of his people to a someone who seems more like a
solipsist.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">As biography, Louis Riel is
ironic. Rather than unfold Riel or reveal him, Brown shuts him up, making him
more rather than less opaque.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[My colleagues have
dealt effectively with some of the essential issues in Chester Brown's
<em>Louis Riel: A Comic Strip Biography</em>*.  In tackling the ideas of
super heroism, bilingualism, cultural erasure, mortality, sainthood,
mysticism, irony, and framing, they've given two succinct yet complex
examinations of what makes Louis Riel such a worthwhile read.  For my part,
I'd like to focus primarily on a close reading of the text's epilogue: a
single, five-panel page that picks up the narrative after the death of Riel.

	In the podcast, I somewhat flippantly framed this conclusion as an
example of “Everything Was Terrible, and Then They Died,” which is the
unofficial theme of every Canadian Literature course I’ve ever taught.  But
it is desperately true in this text.  Not only, as the previous blog posts
address, does our superhero die (the nerve!), but his legacy is left, at the
end of this narrative, completely frustrated.

	<!--more-->In the final five panels, we are told that 24 men who fought
with the Métis were jailed and that many more fled to the States until an
amnesty was declared; that Gabriel Dumont’s wife died and that he joined the
Buffalo Bill Wild West Show; that Riel’s wife lost an infant child, then died
herself, and then Riel’s other two children died, too; that Sir John A.
MacDonald lived to a healthy old age and was Prime Minister forever; and that
George Stephen, president of the CPR, became one of the richest men in the
world and lived to be 92. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/
louis_riel_epilogue.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-323"
title="louis_riel_epilogue"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/
louis_riel_epilogue.jpg" alt="Louis Riel Epilogue" width="244" height="370"
/></a></p> In other words: Métis jailed, exiled, dead; Riel line obliterated;
MacDonald won; and Stephen won even more.  Everything was terrible, and then
they did really die.  Except the bad guys, who made out awesome.

	Why this epilogue, though?

	Because it's not just about representation of truth or history, as this
isn’t where Riel’s story or the Riel-inspired Métis story ends.  A cheerier
epilogue, <a href="http://www.learnmichif.com/home">one involving the Métis
cultural renaissance and Riel’s role in it as a folk hero</a>, is possible
here.  But Brown instead makes a choice to tell a very pessimistic version of
Riel’s legacy in this epilogue, effectively destroying it.  There is no
glimmer of hope and no opening for a sequel.  The camera does not pan to a
baby Riel, swaddled in a basket, offering the promise of future rebellions to
come.  Riel fails as a superhero in this narrative not just because he dies,
but because he resists resurrection.  In the end, he’s just a man -- a dead
one.

	Ultimately, this epilogue underscores Brown’s ambivalence about Riel. 
Riel gets deconstructed, over the course of the narrative, from heroic figure
(albeit reluctant) to ambiguously crazy (should we discount him or not?) to
just broken.  A different story about Riel would have ended differently, with
a more uplifting and hopeful epilogue.  But this is, I think, at its core a
story about tipping points and breaking points.  Brown is not just exploring
Riel-the-character or Canadian identity (though he does do both very well);
he’s also examining motivation and destruction.  What does it take for Riel
to get involved, even when he really doesn’t seem to want to?  And what moves
Riel from defending his culture and faith to rising up against the church he
swore to protect?  The outspoken man from the beginning of the narrative is
so easily and readily silenced at the end -- both literally and immediately,
by his priest, and for all of history, by death, time, and Brown’s chosen
focus.  How he moves through this journey is at the heart of Brown’s
exploration.

	--

	*: This FOOTNOTE is a place to observe that the other place I have seen
this terminology is <em>Ice Haven</em> by Daniel Clowes, which he also terms
a “comic-strip novel.”  This is an observation largely apropos of nothing,
but I am nerdily interested in the naming of graphic narratives.  Is it okay
to say comic book?  What if it’s not a novel, but it is graphic?

<title>#19 Advertising Narratives</title>
<link>http://www.graphixia.ca/2011/04/327/</link> <pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2011
05:43:03 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator> <guid

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Thus far in this space,
we have restricted ourselves to the discussion of what specific texts
represent or themes that those texts foreground. We've discussed how cultural
moments and movements intersect with the content of graphic narratives and
tried to situate the texts within their proper socio-historical context. In
this post, the focus is going to shift slightly, into the margins: the spaces
around the comic book. Namely, advertising.

	<!--more--> <p style="text-align: left;">The central question being posed
here is whether or not advertising plays a part in the narrative sequence of
the comic book. In other words, we might look at how the advertisements
respond to, or mimic, the storyline. Do the advertisements address themes
running through the comic book? And finally, how do the images in
advertisements reflect the images put forward in the comic's ongoing sequence
of images.</p> For now, let's stick with an early comic book: Spiderman's
first solo appearance in a comic book. The narrative is well known: bitten by
a radio-active spider, orphaned teenager Peter Parker searches for a way out
of an uncomfortable adolescence using his newfound powers. In the process of
understanding his role, Parker makes a decision not to act, inadvertently
leading to the death of his Uncle Ben, leaving Parker as the sole breadwinner
for himself and his Aunt May.

	At first glance, <em>Spiderman</em> appears to be innovative because it
represents a "real" teenager with "real" problems. Gone is the
one-dimensional moral clarity of Batman or Superman, replaced with the
confused emerging personality of a persecuted teenager. Peter Parker, for all
his young years, has adult problems that are beyond the comprehension of
archetypal superheroes; Parker needs a job, he needs money, and he needs a
girl.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/ASM001_08.jpg
"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-329" title="ASM001_08"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/ASM001_08.jpg"
alt="" width="360" height="528" /></a>

	Here's where the advertisements come in. Everything Parker needs, the ads
offer. Advertisements in the comic book do not sell what we might assume are
typical 1950s teenage amusements--sporting goods, music, bubble gum, and hair
care products. Instead, they sell muscles (to get the girls), lessons on
refrigeration and air conditioning repair (to get the job and the money). In
short, the advertisements play off all the insecurities Parker has about his
daily life and his self image.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/ASM001_34-1.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-331" title="Body Builder Ad

src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/ASM001_34-1.
jpg" alt="Body Builder Ad in Spiderman #1" width="351" height="525" /></a>

	The body builder selling the "secrets of attracting girls" even borrows
the superhero trope, calling himself Mike Marvel so as to better represent
the possibilities for those who buy the body image he's selling. At the same
time, the advertisements for all their address to teenage angst, also seem to
be aimed at adults, a supposition further supported by the fact that the ads
tend to represent adults in the drawings. The advertisements then tell us
something about the socio-cultural context of the comic book: clearly, the
advertisers knew that kids weren't the only ones reading Spiderman. Indeed,
most of the advertisements call out for "Men" and (or in preference to)
"boys."

	Often, the advertisements seem to answer the siren call of the narrative.
In the <em>Spiderman </em>comic mentioned above, there are some panels in
which the narrative arc is dealing with Parker's desperate need for money.
The advertisement which follows the cliff-hanging moment in the narrative arc
is for a money-making opportunity--one which is predicated on Parker's own
dilemma: not knowing how to get started.

alt="Air Conditioning Ad from Spiderman #1" width="351" height="515" /></a>
What's even more interesting about the lead-in to the advertisement is how
Parker foregrounds his thoughts by questioning the validity of other
superhero narratives where money doesn't seem to be a problem. Parker's
self-examination, and his socio-cultural awareness of superheroes, provide
ample basis for an advertisement "reality check" promising quick fixes. Not
by accident, Parker's own troubles are soon fortuitously resolved and the
advertisement's promises confirmed by the experiences of our "real-world"
teenager's ability to land a job working for the man who hates his alter-ego
most.</p> The advertisements in early comic books are eclectic and diverse.
They represent the fishy--like pet seahorses and dubious coinage schemes
(characteristic of the best super-villains)--and the obvious--like drawing
classes so one can become a great artist (not a comic book artist mind you).
In every way, these advertisements reflect the medium and deserve our
attention for what they tell us about the reception and construction of the
accompanying graphic narratives.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[So, this is an early version of targeting ads,
contextualizing ads, ala google ads?  Cool.

	Gotta tell you that I was always intrigued by and attracted to the ads in
the back of comics too.  It always seemed impossible to get the things those
ads promised: magic sea horses (or whatever they were), x-ray glasses, etc. 
All the stuff that a comic book reading kid would want, to become a super
hero, perhaps - or simply to become the envy of the neighbourhood.  For me,
those were only ever wish items.

	Am I revealing too many personal insecurities?

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ok, so what you're saying is that the adverts
are a part of the narrative or rather complement it in some way? However,
from what I can tell by reading older Batman and Superman comics, these kinds
of adverts were not exaxtly new at the time Amazing Fantasy #15 was
published. While there is merit in your assertion of complementing the
story-line with advertising, I think it is much less some kind of regularity,
but rather the exception. After all, these kinds of ads - bodybuilding,
get-rich-quick and cheap toys - have been present in a large amount of comic
books up to then - and they most certainly did not always complement the
story in this remarkable fashion as you present here. Neither was Spider-Man
specifically tailored to attract that advertising, nor the advertising
tailored specifically for Spider-Man. I don't think that the adverts tell us
much about the graphic narrative and its reception, but rather that they tell
us something about the audience comic books -largely- had at the time

	Just my opinion, of course.]]></wp:comment_content>

<title>#20 Everyday Enemies and the Ordinary World in Early Spiderman</title>

-in-early-spiderman/</link> <pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2011 19:04:43

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color:
#000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span
style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></span>Villainy in the early
<em>Spiderman</em> is a double phenomenon, as the quotidian nemeses of
Spiderman and Peter Parker, who appear in every issue, contrast with the
“super” villains, who are specific to particular issues, though they
frequently make repeat appearances. This contrast testifies to the fact that
Spiderman, and perhaps every super hero comic, works in two registers that
overlap each other but are in fact quite distinct. The frequent split-face
frames in which half the face is Peter Parker’s face and the other half is
Spiderman’s mask signal the double world of the comic: the world of the
“symbolic order” and the world of the “imaginary”. In the world of the
symbolic order all normal social rules apply; teenagers must go to
high-school and take their place in the gendered pecking order. The world of
the imaginary, however, is one where radioactive spider bites allow a hero to
swing from building to building with the help of a web shooter and confront
villains as outlandishly origined and costumed as he is.

	<!--more-->

	<span style="color: #000000;"> </span>The everyday enemies triangulate
with Peter Parker and Spiderman in such a way that demonstrates the
separation of worlds. J Jonah Jameson has a near hysterical hatred of
Spiderman and yet he employs Peter Parker at The Daily Bugle as a
photographer. Readers get a taste of dramatic irony in our knowledge that
Parker and Spiderman are the same person; we see the relationship between
worlds that Jameson does not. For Jameson, the world of the imaginary that
contains Spiderman is always “out there” as Spiderman eludes all his efforts
to stamp him out. No matter what good Spiderman achieves, even when he saves
Jameson’s astronaut son in issue #2, Jameson persists in his hatred. Just as
Spiderman is a typical teenager, Jameson is a standard middle-aged father
figure as he might appear to teenage eyes: irrationally critical, impossible
to satisfy, and full of prejudice. What we have here may be an early 60s
prototype of “The Man,” who later in the decade will represent everything
retrograde in Amercian society. For the moment, however, Jameson is an enemy
of the whole concept of the super hero. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/ASM010_08-
crop.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-350"
title="ASM010_08-crop"

-300x298.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="298" /></a>

	<span style="color: #000000;"></span>Flash Thompson, meanwhile, is the
sign of all that is oppressive about Peter Parker’s teenagehood, especially
the fact that he must keep his super powers secret. Thompson bullies Parker
relentlessly and stereotypically, reminding us of how much Parker represents
the desire of the typical comic book reader, the desire of the “intellectual”
bookworm to become “physical” hero. And yet, Thompson is smitten with
Spiderman, always willing to defend him against Jameson’s suggestions in The
Bugle. Like Jameson, Thompson points to the separation of symbolic and
imaginary worlds, when Peter Parker sets him up to be Spiderman’s alter ego
in issue #8.

	<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial,
sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/ASM008_22-
crop1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-349"
title="ASM008_22-crop"

crop1-300x135.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="135"
/></a></span></span></span>

	After all, it’s more likely that the athletic, muscular Thompson be
Spiderman than the four-eyed science geek. Indeed, when Dr Octopus unmasks
Spiderman to reveal Peter Parker in issue #12, no one believes the
revelation. Parker must have been “dressing up” as Spiderman. The inhabitants
of the symbolic order will not permit the imaginary world of the super hero
to link up with it in this way. Again, Spiderman must exist beyond the
symbolic order.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/ASM012_11-
crop.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-347"

-300x148.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="148" /></a> <span style="color:
#000000;"></span>As simplistic as early <em>Spiderman</em> is, it carefully
keeps the imaginary world distinct from everyday reality, allowing our minds
to function in two perceptual frameworks that the destiny of super hero
comics, in the form of <em>Watchmen</em>, will asymptotically try to bring
together.]]></content:encoded>

<title>#21 Shifting Agencies: Spider-Man’s Contribution to the Silver Age of
Superhero Comics</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[While Spider-man is now
a household name, few recognize what a significant upset he was to the comics
industry during the early 1960s – the immediate popularity of his character
signified a shift in the way comics would be thought of in terms of their
demographics and realized what the industry had been attempting to achieve
for decades prior: a readership who identified with the protagonist.
Superhero comics, at their core, are about establishing fictional agency over
events that are outside of one’s control – the Golden Age of comics,
generally acknowledged to have started with <em>Action Comics #1</em> in
1938, saw heroes battling the forces of social oppression through archetypal
figures of organized crime in often nameless mob leaders, advancing
technologies in mad scientists, and later ideologically though the key
figures of the Second World War as openly displayed in Captain America
knocking out Hitler, Batman passing needed weapons to soldiers or, as the
cover of <em>Action Comics #58</em> shows, Superman hand printing posters
which told America that “Superman says you can slap a Jap with war bonds and
stamps.”

	<!--more-->

	These figures of the Golden age addressed extremely varied but pressing
social and ideological concerns of their day (often in problematic ways), but
they were consistent in at least one aspect: they presented predominantly
adult heroes who were confident and secure, dealing with the metonymic
representations of social ills handily and definitively. DC Comics dominated
the marketplace, and while there were variations in costumes and powers, that
the hero was an adult remained a constant for decades; children and teen
characters of the Golden Age, when appearing at all, were given subordinate
positions, as seen most famously in Batman’s Robin and Captain America’s
Bucky.

	As comics during this era were intended predominantly for children and
adolescents, some have argued that the solely adult hero was a product of
poor marketing; others have claimed that superhero comics were mired in the
traditions of the dimestore novels that preceded them, refusing to
acknowledge that the new medium for these stories demanded a different
approach in their telling. What is more likely is that these comics were
being marketed to the adults who ultimately would purchase them for their
children, on topics that spoke to those with buying power and addressing
water-cooler concerns of the day. What concerned this audience were the
larger social and political issues of the day. When Spider-man erupted in
1962, his presence was a dramatic shift away from these ideological and
social interests to focus more squarely on the teenager and the plight of the
individual – a protagonist who was, for the first time, reflective of the
actual age of superhero comics’ readers.

	Stan Lee’s vision for Spider-man in this regard was unwavering – he
demanded, to the protests of his senior editor, that his hero be an
unexceptional teen and not, as were the common tropes, a billionaire, an
alien or a trained soldier. Lee prognosticated what few others realized about
superhero comics at the time: those who are attracted to the agency that
superhero comics promote are drawn to it in more practical, tangible ways
than through ideologically-based conflicts. Villains such as the mad doctor
Hugo Strange, Hitler’s protégé Red Skull or billionaire madman Lex Luthor,
while compelling, are hardly accessible to the adolescent (or even truly the
adult) reader – while one can celebrate in the chosen hero’s triumph over the
capitalistic power of Luthor or the fascism of Red Skull, these victories do
not provide entry in such a way as to allow readers to identify with the
application of this agency in their own lives, again being the cornerstone of
the superhero genre as a whole.

	Tellingly, Spider-man’s introduction prompted a title change from Amazing
Adult Fantasy to Amazing Fantasy, with his first appearance being in issue
#15. Though the cover addressed the trope of the adult archetypal hero, being
arguably a swipe of Batman’s first appearance in <em>Detective Comics
#27</em>, and was again marketed to the parent who had purchasing power, the
content was radically different from what the industry had seen to this
point. Peter Parker was a bullied teenager, orphaned and in the care of an
elderly aunt and uncle, and required tangible control over his personal
circumstances in a way that was both pointed and realistic – indeed, his
first act on receiving his powers from a radioactive spider bite was to enter
a wrestling contest in pursuit of a cash prize. Unlike his predecessors,
Spider-man does not live in a world of moral binaries, and while standing for
good, his reaction is not that of a cultural signifier but of an individual
youth.

	This shift in how comics understood the demands of its readership –
agency of the individual, not of society on the whole – is now a common facet
of the comics industry. Amazing Fantasy #15, though at first considered a
long shot, was Marvel’s best selling single issue to that point in the
company’s history and prompted the introduction of more teenage characters
who, though imbued with various powers, all had personal problems as well
that were addressed in the background of super-villain battles. The X-Men,
the first teenaged team, were launched late in the year following
Spider-man’s introduction and became another highly successful title for the
company. DC comics was slower to follow suit, being placed in the problematic
position of having long-established adult characters – they opted for
slapstick situations and storylines during the Silver Age involving these
household names, and it is likely because of this ineffective approach at
garnering teenage readers that Marvel, with its growing host of new,
adolescent characters who could be more easily identified with, quickly
gained market dominance. By the advent of Spider-man, DC’s Superman and
Batman were already cultural memes and there was little that could be done to
reconcile this fact with the shifting market.

	The introduction of Spider-man to the world of comics represented a
paradigm shift in the way that the superhero was constructed – his success
meant the creation of characters who were more easily identified with, who
had relatable problems and who had struggles of conscience in dealing with
their real life concerns. Prior to Spider-man, agency was left in the capable
hands of the superhero who would right wrongs and provide confidence in the
reader that justice would be served on a larger scale – Spider-man, however,
shifted this perspective to show that agency lies more potently within the
individual, that anyone - regardless of circumstances - can become a hero in
his or her own life, and cautioned us that with this “great power comes great
responsibility.”]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Is there anything more
tantalizing to the obnoxious literary scholar than the modest hyphen?  There
it sits, indicating connectedness and yet emphasizing separateness. 
Everybody* loves to debate the placement of hyphens in a literary text, and
here we have one right in our protagonist’s name.

	Spider-Man.  <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvwbVGDk_5A&amp;feature=related">Not
Phil Spiderman, as Chandler Bing once joked</a>, but Spider-Man.  With this
moniker, Peter Parker (occasionally Palmer) simultaneously connects his
humanity to his acquired powers and distances himself from them. He is a
Spider-Man in a way that allows him to retain his personhood and not fully
become a spider the way, say, the Vulture is not Vulture-Man but rather
wholly and completely Vulture.  Vulture, as a super-villain, does not need to
retain his humanity in quite the same way.

	<!--more--> <p style="text-align: left;">In fact, Spider-Man works hard
to keep his identities separate, even within himself:</p> <p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/spacebetween0
.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-375" title="spacebetween0"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/spacebetween0.
jpg" alt="" width="298" height="284" /></a></p> Which is not to say that this
entire post is going to be about hyphens.  But noticing the hyphen did get me
interested in the spaces between in these early issues of <em>The Amazing
Spider-Man</em>: the silences, blank spaces, missing pieces, and need for
space articulated throughout the comic.

	For example, in the very early issues, much of the action actually
happens during the ad breaks.  In <em>Amazing Spider-Man #1</em>, for
example, he repairs the capsule during a larger silence; we don’t actually
see the repair, only the success:

	Before the ad for “How to Draw Anything!”: <p style="text-align:

jpg" alt="" width="585" height="557" /></a></p> This happens again in the
next issue; fighting Vulture, Spider-Man finds himself inside a water tank. 
He escapes, of course, but the mechanism of the escape again happens in the
liminal space between the panels (and again, during an ad break) and in a
space the reader is simply not privy to.  Instead we are told what will
happen, and then that it has happened.  We don’t see the process.

	Before the ad for “How to Fight Anything!”: <p style="text-align:
center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/spacebetween3
.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-379" title="spacebetween3"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/spacebetween3.
jpg" alt="" width="589" height="292" /></a></p> And after: <p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/spacebetween4
.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-380" title="spacebetween4"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/spacebetween4.
jpg" alt="" width="587" height="283" /></a></p> There are lots of potential
explanations for this, primary among them likely the fact that a youthful
imagination can probably conjure up more glory in the empty space than Steve
Ditko (or anyone else) can possibly draw.  These empty spaces allow room for
imagination that we don’t always associate with graphic novels and comics,
which are usually seen as a show-and-tell medium.  It’s also striking that
this happens through an ad break -- the advertisements don’t pause the
action!  Spider-Man is still Spider-Manning while you’re poring over ads for
Saturday Shoe Salesmanship.  Even in contemporary “reality” TV,
advertisements almost always pause the action.  This is something different,
and in an interesting way it almost encourages a reader to hurry past the
advertisements lest he or she miss the action.

	I find this particularly interesting when contrasted with scenes where no
silence is offered: the fight scenes.  Spider-Man obsessively narrates the
fights in a way that allows no room for alternate readings of his conquests.

	OH NOES I AM AGAINST THE WALL IN CASE YOU COULD NOT TELL FROM THE
ACCOMPANYING DRAWING: <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/spacebetween5
.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-381" title="spacebetween5"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/spacebetween5.
jpg" alt="" width="285" height="290" /></a></p> One would think this volume
of narration would slow down the fight scenes, though it doesn’t seem to have
this effect.  It does seem to likewise undercut the show-and-tell medium of
the comic, however, given that in these scenes the show is rather less
important than the incessant telling.

	There are other essential spaces in the text, too -- not least the spaces
Peter Parker must find in which to transition into his Spider-Man identity.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/spacebetween6
.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-382" title="spacebetween6"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/spacebetween6.
jpg" alt="" width="198" height="285" /></a></p> Parker goes from being a
young man effectively forced into solitude by school bullies to one who seeks
out moments alone in order to achieve true greatness.  One of the most
interesting debates that emerges through the letters pages is the tension
between those fans who want Spider-Man to have a sidekick, partner, or even
to join the Fantastic Four, versus those who like that Spider-Man battles
through life alone.  Parker gains the esteem of his classmates slowly over
the series, but by that point his identity as Spider-Man has created an
uncrossable chasm between himself and the other teenagers.

	There are missing pieces in the narrative, too.  Like why does J. Jonah
Jameson hate Spider-Man so acutely?  How old is Betty supposed to be,
anyway?  These empty space only really come to light when one starts to
examine the narrative closely, however.  But together, all of these ideas
seem to point to the importance of space, absence, and silence in the world
of <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em>.

	---

	Apropos of nothing, I was quite struck by the inclusion of full names and
addresses on the letters pages.  Which generation is it that’s supposed to
have a total disregard for privacy, again?

	And as a further aside, I really enjoyed revisiting Spider-Man’s origins;
reading these early comics has almost repaired the damage done to Spider-Man
for me in the <em>Civil War</em> Marvel world event (which was awesome in
almost every way except for Spidey being such an epic tool).

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:
left;">Reading through both vintage <em>Spiderman</em> comics and the
<em>Spider-Man</em> issues that are part of the 2006-07<em> Civil War</em>
series, it strikes me that comics are unique when it comes to providing the
well-meaning critic with something to do. With comics, particularly those
featuring Superheroes but not exclusively, we are always already and
simultaneously reading the text through comic's histories and ignoring those
same histories to make way for the new.</p> <p style="text-align:
left;"><!--more--></p> <p style="text-align: left;">When we first meet him,
Spiderman is a compound noun, a single word. His character development is
sloppy, the context all over the place, and the storylines--one featuring the
aged, pot-bellied "Vulture" as formidable villain--are not yet the pinnacle
of the series, but he is as complete as he will ever be--web-slinging,
sticky-fingered, red, blue, slant-eyed costume with webbing. It's all there,
right at the beginning.</p> <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/
spiderman_02_01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-386"
title="spiderman_02_01"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/
spiderman_02_01.jpg" alt="Spiderman is a compound noun" width="176"
height="553" /></a> <p style="text-align: left;">When we see him in the<em>
Civil War</em> series, Spider-Man--and by extension Peter Parker--are quite
different characters. In fact, gone is the spindly, spectacled science-geek,
with the crew-cut and awkward sport coat; in his place we have the
beautifully coiffed, physically magnificent, and supermodel-married,
experienced superhero--the envy of all who toil below him. In short,
Spider-Man, like his hyphen suggests is more Man than he ever was, but the
costume remains (at least for the reveal).</p> <p style="text-align:
center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/
spiderman_02_03.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-388  aligncenter"

spiderman_02_04-248x300.jpg" alt="Spiderman the beautiful" width="248"
height="300" /></a></p> <p style="text-align: left;">The central point here
is that, despite the spaces joined by his hyphenated <em>nom-de-plume</em>,
we are looking at Spiderman as though he were a compound noun. The
adjective--a man who is "spiderish" indicated by the hyphenation--is long
gone, and it in its place is a "person / place / or thing" that has a rich,
varied history and an accompanying mythology that stretches some sixty-odd
years. We are reading a text--the Spiderman--that can be, and has been,
edited over and over again, and by different authors in different styles.
Spider-man is made up of a never-ending cycle of revision in which the
stability of the character's traits, habits, look, age, emotions, etc., are
consistently changing, responding to emerging socio-cultural contexts (such
as 9/11 in<em> Civil War</em>), and integrating the shifting paradigms of
human relationships over time.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">The issue for
readers of course is which Spider-man are we reading? Of course, this
question leads to many protracted exchanges about the relative value of a
particular era or artist, but it also challenges traditional critical
approaches. Can we imagine what James Joyce's<em> Ulysses</em> might look
like if it were consistently re-written over the last 60 years, and by
different authors? Spider-Man, and the genre to which the character belongs,
shows its allegiance to the serialized novel of the Victorian era, but at the
same time also rhymes with the often multiplied author and subject-matter of
the digital; the daily blog, the collaborative, multi-authored environment of
the website, even the "reader pages" at the back of vintage
<em>Spider-Man</em> comics mimic the "like / dislike" themes and wall-posting
methodologies of social media.</p> In short, <em>Spider-Man</em> is the
proverbial #hashtag that trends according to the context in which it finds
itself. Our expectations for Peter Parker change, or we ignore the fact that
Peter Parker is not who he once was and keep moving. What we don't do is
linger over the differences--or inconsistencies--between vintage<em>
Spiderman </em>and now<em> Spider-Man</em>, letting them ruin the makings of
a good story. Much like life-experiences, we're often drawn to the lure of
the new, disregarding the past and descending happily into the maelstrom
without accounting for what we already know.

spiderman_02_05-287x1024.jpg" alt="Mary Jane's Boobs #2" width="103"
height="368" /></a></p> Our Spider-senses tingle, but we don't really check
things out and go back to the vintage texts and track the discontinuity.
Instead, we revel in the new, modernized storylines, the close-ups of Mary
Jane's breasts (one suspects Aunt May is a little leery of them), and the
fantastic new costumes, content that this<em> Spider-Man</em> is the same<em>
Spiderman</em> we have always known; he has to be. And, in some odd way, he
both is the <em>Spiderman</em> we have always known and he is also the
<em>Spider-Man</em> we need to know again.

	In the end, we're shutting down a lot our critical faculties to look at
the pictures and read a <em>Spider-Man</em> storyline. We're accepting a lot
of shifting representations and ignoring a lot of history, substituting a
consistent--if sometimes reinvented--mythology. What we might be giving up is
a self-reflective socio-cultural record of what concerns us or even a common
artistic take on the human condition. Suffice to say, <em>Spider-Man</em> is
also <em>Spiderman</em>. He is both the symbol of our shifting
descriptors--the things that help others distinguish us from the
everyday--and a compounded history of all the people, places, and things that
have intermingled in the web of our Westernized socio-cultural history. "It's
Spider-Man," after all. Or is it?

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[So far, my posts on
superhero comics have focused on the relationship between alternate worlds,
the way the “imaginary” register of the hero, with his or her powers and
nemeses, relates to the “symbolic” register of quotidian reality.  Superhero
comics are often governed by a plausibility principle, the need to explain or
justify what happens in the imaginary register to the symbolic register.
Early Spider-Man in particular possesses a strong plausibility
principle: Peter Parker is a “genuine” teenager with “genuine” teenage
problems. He must live in the symbolic register even as he performs heroic
feats as Spider-Man in the imaginary one.  Sexuality is of course fundamental
to the condition of the genuine teenager[1].  In the early Spider-Man,
Peter’s problems with sexual relationships invoke further divisions
between worlds, specifically, the worlds of work and high school, and by
implication, the worlds of adulthood and childhood. The tension between these
worlds is just as fraught as that between the world of the superhero and the
world of everyday life.

	<!--more-->

	Generally speaking, the love interest is a problem for the male superhero
because he always faces the question of whether his girlfriend might discover
his identity and out him.  Furthermore, the hero faces the temptation to
reveal himself; after all, the possession of super powers is a powerful
secondary sexual characteristic.  Because the hero’s alter ego appears to be
an unacceptable object choice, the revelation of these powers promises sexual
success.

	<a

-crop-300x221.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="221" /></a>

	Jonathan Lethem's <em>Fortress of Solitude</em> offers a comic version of
hero’s revelatory dilemma. Dylan Ebdus leaves his home in Brooklyn to spend a
summer in Vermont as a "Fresh Air Kid." At the end of the summer, he decides
to reveal his “true” identity as the superhero Aeroman to Heather, the
daughter of the family he is staying with, a girl with whom he has a budding
romantic relationship. The purpose of the revelation is to seal the deal on
the relationship.  The moment is awkward because in the symbolic order, such
a revelation is embarassing; just as Dylan is entering the adult world of
sexuality, he exposes the childish world of his imagination (even though he
really can fly!).  What would be a moment of triumph becomes one of failure
because of Dylan’s inability to obey the principle of the separation of
worlds.  This principle has broken down as superhero comics have tried to
engage more with the world of “reality” in more recent years, but in the
early Spider-Man, the principle remains firm. Peter Parker cannot reveal
himself as Spider-Man to either Liz Allan or Betty Brant, the two women who
both provide the love interest and represent the quotidian world where one
has no special powers, a world in which one must toil away at work or school
just like everyone else.

	Peter Parker’s love triangle with Betty and Liz, along with his caring
for Aunt May and his bullying at the hands of Flash Thompson make up his
matrix of reality, the daily concerns that prove that he is an actual person
with whom the reader can identify and not just a spider-bitten freak. His
circumstances--he must look after his ailing Aunt May--force him into
an accelerated transition from the world of childhood into that of adult
responsibility. Indeed, “With great power comes great responsibility” might
as well be the slogan for being a grown up as well as being a super hero.
Meanwhile, Peter’s  schoolmates enjoy a carefree teenage life that Liz Allan
is fully part of. Initially, she taunts Peter with all the other kids. And
because she is Flash Thompson’s girlfriend, she represents the world of
social acceptability and the sexual partnering that goes with it, a world
from which Peter is excluded because he is a science nerd. He wears big
glasses, a yellow waistcoat or sweater vest, and focuses entirely on his
studies.

	But, as he comes to grips with his new powers, Peter begins to gain
confidence and attraction in the social world. He begins his transformation
in issue #8, in which he has a boxing match with Flash Thompson. Early in the
comic, Flash gives Peter a push and breaks his glasses. He never wears them
again.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ASM008-Page-4
-crop.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-426" title="ASM008 -

crop-186x300.jpg" alt="" width="186" height="300" /></a>

	His clothes begin to change as well. The yellow sweater vest gives way to
a a more neutral colour in issue #9.  At the same time, Liz begins to realize
the limitations in Flash as an object choice--he is a dumb jock, after
all--and becomes interested in Peter, who, without glasses, looks less like
a teenaged Clark Kent.

	Meanwhile, Betty Brant, who is J Jonah Jameson’s secretary, undergoes a
transformation from a maternal figure to a potential romantic partner for
Peter.  As her hair changes from curly perm to a younger-looking bob, we find
that she too is of high school age and that she has had to leave school and
enter the work force because of her brother’s gambling debts. Her entry into
the world of responsibility echoes Peter’s, but she has been more severely
split from the high school world. So it is not surprising that she is jealous
of Liz Allan, who threatens to pull Peter back to the world she has been shut
out of. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/photo-1-crop.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-427" title="photo (1)-crop"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/photo-1-crop-
300x145.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="145" /></a></p> When Betty gets
jealous of Liz, it's a sign that Peter Parker has difficulty holding all of
his worlds in  place, keeping them separate [2]. <em>The Amazing
Spider-Man</em> is a world of binaries, Spider-Man/Peter Parker;
Adult/Child; Work/School; even Blond/Brunette. The manichean universe of the
super hero comic operates through the continual transgression and
reinforcement of the boundary between the terms that repeats what happens
with the boundary between the  imaginary and the symbolic.

	The destinies of Betty and Liz in the Spider-man story arc show that once
a character is in a super-hero comic book, he or she will not only persist
through a multitude of permutations, but that that character will be dragged
into the imaginary register from the symbolic one.  Liz Allan’s step brother
is Molten Man, and she marries Harry Osborne, who becomes the Green Goblin.
Betty Brant marries Ned Leeds, who ends up being brainwashed into being the
Hobgoblin. Peter Parker’s spider bite does not simply transform him, but the
world around him and the people in it as well.  The imaginary register
thus infects the symbolic and the division of worlds that sustains the heroic
universe is difficult to maintain. Transgressing the boundary between the
imaginary and symbolic registers is what makes the story interesting. But if
the boundary dissolves altogether, the story loses all substance and tension.

	[1] One wonders why more superheros aren’t like Tintin, who never
troubles himself with girls or boys in a romantic or sexual way.

	[2] That Liz and Betty are both variants of Elizabeth stresses the link
between them.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Continuity - in
characterization, the details of character evolution and origins, and the
universes that heroes participate in – is essential for the reader of
mainstream superhero comics in order to create a sense of personal investment
in both the storyline and the heroes themselves. The readership paradoxically
demands a strict adherence to the ‘reality’ of the universe in which they
encounter their fictional characters, while accepting that these characters
are often imbued with specious or fantastic powers. Scholarship as well likes
absolutes in order to generate discussion – we need stability in our
referents in order to be able to construct arguments where basic principles
are understood by our audiences. In dealing with characters that have been
written about over, quite frequently, more than half a century, authors
frequently encounter many problems in navigating the demands of the universes
that they are writing for.

	<!--more-->

	Long-running comics present a number of issues in regard to consistency
in their narration and plot points because of their polyphonic nature, with
each subsequent author of a character wanting to put his or her own mark on
the title. This said, when faced with a character like Spider-Man, an author
doesn’t so much write the character as he writes ‘into’ or ‘for’ him based on
the precedents that have been established by previous authors – current
popular comics’ writers like Bendis, Johns and Morrison are all
self-professed superhero scholars, capable of citing decades-old details and
sometimes retconning these to attempt to reinvigorate characters that have
grown static or playing to audiences that appreciate nostalgia in their
stories. Individual authorship here is problematic, and one cannot help but
be tempted to invoke Foucault’s author function in light of the way that the
superhero genre is delivered, inferring that in comics the primacy of content
over authorial context has finally found purchase. This can be both a
positive and negative attribute of comics, though, as it creates a sense of
familiarity but can also inhibit character growth and development.

	This was not always the case, however. In early Spider-Man, for example,
when he was a new and inviting character, consistency mattered much less than
it now does with Amazing Spider- Man nearing its 700th issue. In his first
appearance in Amazing Fantasy #15, even Spider-Man’s name wasn’t consistent,
alternating between “Spiderman” and the hyphenated “Spider-Man.” J. Jonah
Jameson, publisher of the Daily Bugle, shifted to becoming the publisher of
“Now” magazine and then back to the Bugle in early issues of Amazing, and
other problems arose regarding adherence to detail in subsequent issues based
on information given previously. However, even in these early stages of
Spider-Man’s development, we can see how creator Stan Lee was aware that
outside reality in his fantasy needed to be maintained – the first appearance
of the Vulture, in Amazing #2, makes sure to let the reader know that the
villain’s wings are an artificial construction, even while the onlookers of
his crimes are perplexed as to how a man could fly on his own power. Though
the reader is asked to suspend reality to the degree that he can accept his
hero’s abilities, grounding this belief in a plausible framework is essential
for the hero’s (and the title’s) success. Spider-Man’s webs, for example, are
explained as a “special fluid” that is a product of his prowess in chemistry,
and Lee refined these details in order to make a central, coherent universe
in which the character could operate – with occasional crossovers with other
titles like Fantastic Four and X-Men – before leaving the series with issue
#110 in the hands of Gerry Conway. The central aspects of Spider-Man’s
origins remained (and still remain) constant, ensuring continuing readership,
despite numerous retellings and revisionings, such as Loeb and Sale’s
compelling Spider-Man: Blue. Suspension of reality, then, only goes so far as
to invite the reader to participate in the universe of the superhero, and
once the universe has been defined, it is fixed – too much cognitive
disconnect within it and the reader is not able to identify with the title,
whether this be in the reality of the universe itself or in the nuances of
the plotlines, carried out over decades.

	As Spider-Man continued and more authors were accepted into the fold, new
series arose – Spectacular Spider-Man first in the 70’s, followed by Web of
Spider-Man in the 80’s and simply Spider-Man in the 90’s, each having to
adhere to the information that came before it. Though there were some
shake-ups in character development, anything that was a huge reversal for the
character was both denounced by the readership and reworked so as to
eliminate consistency issues – this was most notable recently in the Clone
Saga, where it was revealed that the Peter Parker we had been following was
actually the ‘real’ Spider-Man’s clone (very confusing), and in Civil War,
where Spider-Man revealed his identity to the world under the Superhuman
Registration Act. This latter was so reviled by the readership of Marvel
Comics, as shown through letters to the publisher and on Marvel’s message
boards, that immediately on the conclusion of the summer ‘event’ of Civil
War, Spider-Man’s identity was re-concealed from the world (thanks to the
efforts of Dr. Strange) so as to maintain the central attributes that, in
effect, make Spider-Man the familiar character that the readership demands.
Changes have occurred, certainly, as otherwise the title would hardly be as
entertaining as it is and readers would become tired of repeated storylines.
Indeed, Conway, in making his own mark, within two years of taking over
Amazing, killed off love interest Gwen Stacy and introducing the Punisher,
currently a mainstay of the Marvel Universe. Peter Parker has had several
careers, from photographer to high school teacher to, currently, a
professional academic in a think-tank. One sees that there is a progression
in characterization that is more fulfillment of Parker’s original desire for
acceptance amongst his peers (though, admittedly, that peer group has changed
as he has aged), but the central tenets of what we could consider a platonic
“Spider-Man” must be acknowledged when writing for the character. More
importantly, the details of all of these stages of progression are of extreme
significance to the long-term reader that has given Spider-Man (and countless
other heroes) such success – from names and dates to particular issue numbers
when characters have been killed off, revamped, gotten married or had
children, the comic reader has become invested in the details just as much as
any scholar who has a practiced hand at close reading.

	The author of superhero comics is then presented with a readership that
is arguably far more demanding than in any other genre or medium; he must
cater to the nostalgic elements of the character he is assigned which have
ensured his title’s longevity while still offering compelling narratives that
will entice the reader into continuing to follow the hero’s adventures. When
a major alteration is attempted, this is interestingly accomplished outside
of the mainstream universe in which the reader has his particular
expectations that authors will adhere to the detailed histories of their
characters. For Marvel, the central universe has been named “Earth 616” –
this is the environment that most casual comics’ readers will be familiar
with, and what we might think of as canon. The panoply of Marvel characters
function in this universe, and they must adhere to the rich histories that
have come in countless crossovers, guest appearances and in their own
multiple titles. Reboots and dramatic shifts are so anathema to comics’
mainstay readership that they must occur under what are normally considered
“imprints” of the central publishing line and are therefore understood to be
outside of the main continuity; these have been, notably, “New Universe,”
“Ultimate Comics” and most recently “Icon,” though there have been many
others over the decades.

	While Spider-Man asks the reader to set aside notions of plausibility in
the character’s origin (and the origins of some of his notable opponents),
this must be compensated for by a far stricter adherence to the realities of
the fictional world in which he acts. Though this was quite simple in the
earliest issues of the title (even if it was somewhat ineffective), when
Marvel began in Amazing #1 asking for audience participation and investment
in the form of letters, it began engendering a response that was highly
engaged in the storylines and consistency of character and plot details. Even
the first letters, printed in issue #3 of Amazing, highlight the nature of
this engagement; for this letters page, Margaret Seth wrote: “Having read
almost as many stories as you have written I feel my opinion is as good as
the next fellow’s. Meaning to say that your startling story in #1 copy of
Spider-Man was terrific. But may I ask what in the world did you do to the
second part? Is he so different that nothing can go his way? Your next issue
is supposed to be great, but if more of your fans such as I feel this way
after reading the first issue… well, I don’t think I’d waste my good money on
another copy like the first.” (<a
href="http://spiderfan.org/comics/reviews/spiderman_amazing/003.html">
Citation</a>). It is this attitude amongst readers, demanding consistency
even in character reaction to his fictional world, that has created the
investment that has made the character last for so long – it is also this now
involuntary close reading on the part of the fans that demands that the
particularities of the interactional space be fixed, as readers trace out the
complex histories of even the most peripheral characters and feel invested in
the imaginary world of their heroes.]]></content:encoded>

War</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[The recurring theme in
Marvel's <em>Civil War</em> arc is sacrifice and loss.  Richard Reed loses
Sue and indeed the entire foundation of their relationship -- her awe of his
morality and strength -- to Tony Stark's plans.  Stark loses his growing
fatherly relationship with Peter Parker and his personal battle with
sobriety.  Canada loses its Alpha Flight (a totally unacceptable casualty of
war!).  And at the end of it all, Steve Rogers loses his life -- maybe.
 Indeed the entire central premise of the Super Hero Registration Act is one
of sacrifice, wherein a hero can trade his or her anonymity for
government-granted legitimacy.

	But sometimes (and often most compellingly), the ones making the
sacrifices aren't the ones in the capes.

	<!--more-->From the <em>Road to Civil War </em>imprint on, Mary Jane and
Aunt May are pivotal to the choices and decisions Peter Parker makes about
his support, and later rejection, of the SHRA.  In these early issues, Peter
(and to a certain extent, MJ) treat Stark as a father figure -- it is, we are
told repeatedly, Peter's trust in Stark that wins Peter's agreement with the
SHRA, even though he has early misgivings.  And while MJ is appreciative of
the support they receive from Stark -- especially the new costume that will
keep her husband safer -- Stark is also an incredibly intrusive presence,
particularly in her life.  (He even has an eagle statue placed in MJ and
Peter's room for communication, but MJ wonders if the statue can see into the
room and therefore see her at various stages of undress.  Not so fatherly a
figure, then.)

	In this <em>Road to Civil War </em>series, readers are reminded that
Spider-Man has a lot to lose by going public with his identity.  Many
superheroes are unattached, or their romantic involvements are with other
superheroes, but Peter's deepest attachments are in the civilian world.
 Peter, very much a family man in his uncaped life, must sacrifice his
privacy -- and therefore the identities of the two people closest to him, MJ
and Aunt May -- in order to support Stark's SHRA drive.  In fact, this fact
almost stops Peter from unmasking, until his Aunt May presents him with a
"classic" Spider-Man costume and remind him of his Uncle Ben's words, adding,
"Responsibility means you don't run away when someone asks, 'Who did that?'"

	The tragedy in Aunt May giving Peter that final push in favour of
registration comes near the end of Civil War, of course, because Peter's
deepest fears do come true: Aunt May is shot in the stomach (though the
sniper had been aiming for he and MJ).  As Kingpin quotes Euripides, "Whom
the gods would destroy, they first make mad."*  The question of whether the
Civil War has been worth it is perhaps most acute in this moment.

	Throughout the texts of <em>Civil War</em>, whether Spider-Man is
supporting or rejecting the SHRA, Aunt May and MJ offer uncompromising
support.  It's an interesting contrast to Richard and Sue Reed; Sue is
empowered to disagree with her husband's position and join with the doomed
resistance fighters.  Is it her own superheroism that allows Sue to disagree
with her powered spouse?  Is there space for an uncaped hanger-on like MJ or
Aunt May to disagree with Spidey?  It raises questions about the role of
non-powered characters -- who are, of course, usually women and children --
in the Marvel world.  Can they do anything but stand by their men?

	-----

	* Before you jump in and tell me that Aunt May doesn't really die, (1)
I'm only dealing with the Civil War arc here, and (2) Peter only saves Aunt
May by making a deal with Mephisto: Aunt May will survive if Peter turns back
time and erases his marriage to MJ -- and their future daughter, too.  (See
the truly terrible<em> One More Day</em> / <em>Brand New Day</em> arcs for
that story.)  Pretty significant sacrifice for caped and uncaped, there.
 Either Aunt May dies or Mary Jane loses everything she has built her life
around.  Oh, Spidey.]]></content:encoded>

	Though there have been many Golden Age superheroes who have lasted into
the present day with continually running serials (Superman, Captain America,
and the entire Justice Society of America for example), few have had the
staying power and continued cultural relevance as Batman. Why is this the
case? Of all of the super heroes that have transitioned into other media and
popular culture, Batman is, at least on the surface, the most simple: a child
whose parents were murdered in front of his eyes dons a costume in order to
exact vengeance on the “stupid and cowardly lot” who would seek to do the
same to others. Unlike other popular characters, he has no fantastic power
other than that of great wealth and training, and his sense of justice is,
with the possible exception of Superman, the least nuanced of all the
mainstream heroes – for Batman, there has consistently been a definitive line
between right and wrong that needs to be upheld. At first glance, Batman has
all the makings of an entirely archetypal hero, easily deciphered and
dispensed with in order to move on to more elaborate fare.

	<!--more-->

	&nbsp;

	This said, Batman is the most prolific character in comics, having had
multiple series at any given moment along with countless one-shots,
miniseries and crossovers over the decades. <em>Detective Comics</em>, of
which Batman has been the main focus since his first appearance, is second
only to <em>Action Comics</em> as superhero comics’ longest running title (as
of this writing, it stands at issue #877), and his solo title has recently
surpassed 700 issues itself. Batman currently has more ongoing titles than
any other <em>DC</em> character, with new series being added annually.
<em>Legends of the Dark Knight</em> ran for over 200 issues, and there have
been other major titles starring the character, such as Shadow of the Bat,
that have lasted several years on their own as well. Despite being a
<em>DC</em> character, he has made guest appearances in Marvel titles as well
as those of other smaller publishing houses, is the focus of many novels,
movies and TV serials including live action and cartoons, and he is also the
most widely discussed character in these early stages of mainstream comics
transitioning into the academic arena. Despite his apparent simplicity then,
Batman is a staple of comic fandom and has maintained relevance across
generations as he nears his 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary.

	Created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger in 1939, Batman came about largely as
a response to the success of Siegel and Shuster’s Superman – the publisher
was looking for new ways to capitalize on the public’s growing interest in
costumed crimefighting and was eager to add new characters to its stable. He
was not a new invention by any stretch of the imagination, the general
concept, if not the details, having been born out of the detective serials of
the 1930’s. While detective fiction abounded, however, the superhero was a
relatively new invention for the era. That the rise of the costumed hero came
about during the final stages of the Great Depression in America is hardly a
surprise as well, as many scholars have noted: Unsure of the stability of the
nation, the costumed hero who brought social justice where the government had
so dramatically failed was needed escapism for a people desperate for order
and equity, a fantasy of rationality and a good-versus-evil paradigm when so
many were suffering under the apparent collapse of capitalism.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Batman-002.
png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-553" title="Batman 002"

219x300.png" alt="" width="219" height="300" /></a>

	Appearing first in <em>Detective Comics</em> #27 (though we don’t see a
hint of his origins until issue #33), the introduction of Batman marked a
shift in the title – prior to his invention, <em>Detective</em> was a
traditional gumshoe serial that introduced characters of little staying power
(with Shuster and Siegel’s pre-Superman character Slam Bradley being the
notable exception). At 64 pages per issue, early Detective was an anthology
comic and offered multiple mystery and crime tales, with only a few stories
being serialized beyond their individual issues. Bob Kane’s previous
character for <em>Detective</em>, Oscar the Gumshoe, had seen moderate
success with fans, but it was his idea for a “Bat-Man” (note the original
hyphen) based on a composite of Douglas Fairbanks, Da Vinci sketches and
Sherlock Holmes that caught his publisher’s interest. Bill Finger was
assigned to assist with the character, and it was actually Finger who created
the costume that has become so iconic –Kane’s original design was more a
clone of Superman with red colouring, no cape and a mask instead of a cowl.
Though Kane is normally credited with the creation of the character, Finger’s
role in his development cannot be underestimated.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Batman-003.
png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-554" title="Batman 003"

300x274.png" alt="" width="300" height="274" /></a>

	The Batman appearing in these earliest issues of <em>Detective</em> was
quite different from what readers are now familiar with; despite the costume
and secret identity, he was more of a traditional private dick, even carrying
a gun. Criminals were killed without remorse by this Batman, and his nemeses
were far less grandiose and fantastic than those we see in later issues of
<em>Detective</em> and his solo title, with Batman foiling normal heists, mob
bosses and the occasional mad scientist. In order to access a younger
demographic, however, <em>DC</em> (then <em>National Publications</em>)
requested that Batman have a child sidekick. Kane had originally envisioned a
super-powered youth, but it was one of his assistants, Jerry Robinson, who
was instrumental in conceiving of the original Robin who, like Batman, had no
fantastic powers to create an entry point of identification for younger
readers. From Robin’s introduction in <em>Detective Comics</em> #38 on, the
series took on a more youthful tone, and in the Silver Age Batman began to
battle more fantastic creatures such as space aliens and time-traveling
cavemen in order to capture the younger demographic. The earlier issues were
still mysteries, however, and the book remained an anthology title with other
stories with various characters running alongside a regular Batman feature
for several years. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Batman-004.
png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-555" title="Batman 004"

300x286.png" alt="" width="300" height="286" /></a>

	The question remains: why has Batman survived for so long, visioned and
revisioned by countless authors and artists over the decades while all
pointing back to a platonic Batman as established by Kane and Finger’s
original concept? It could be, perhaps, a relation of our original desire to
see justice served, and a knowledge that our own, governmentally mandated law
and order allows for inequities on an almost comical magnitude – it was this
concept that served as the impetus for Batman and other superheroes, after
all. It could also be the stark vision of legality that we see in Batman’s
understanding of good and evil, simplifying for the reader a complex dynamic
of conflicting moralities in order to bring some stability to our own, often
overwhelmed perspectives on the social world – the truth for a detective is
definitive, and in these stories one just needs to be able to decipher the
clues in the correct way in order to rationalize the overly problematic.
Bruce Wayne is also a member of the American elite, and there is certainly a
precedent for interest in celebrity culture and a desire to see these
cultural icons as something more than human. These points, though certainly
being elements of his success, could be made of all detective fiction, from
Sherlock Holmes to Dick Tracy to the Green Hornet, and there is clearly
something more to Batman’s specific character that makes him survive and
remain relevant.

	Batman succeeds, more likely, because of the innovative blend between
heroism and the everyday – his powers are the result of exhaustive training
and a vast fortune inherited from his parents, making him accessible to the
readership in a way that nearly all other superheroes are not. His origin,
boiled down, is the platonic revenge tale that one sees in Shakespearian or
Greek tragedy, and in this Batman is a blank canvas on which authors have
been able to expand and expound on the core facets of his character over many
years. He struggles to discover his true identity while driven by fanatical
vengeance, and at times we are unsure of which character, Wayne or Batman, is
really the mask. Despite the division, he exists in a world of certitudes and
strength of character, showing us that order may come from chaos given enough
perseverance and the right motivation at our backs, and these attributes
involve us in his stories while prompting us to recognize and reconcile the
moral inequities that we notice in our own lives. While beginning as a simple
vigilante with what could be considered a basic origin, Batman has been
chiseled into a character as complex as the sum of the authors who have tried
their hands at relating his saga – the posts in the coming weeks will be
exploring some of these revisions, extensions and reworkings of continuity.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Two things are
important to know about Batman / Bruce Wayne: 1) he's bent on revenge and
vigilante justice; 2) he's bored.

	Boredom is a running theme in <em>Batman</em>. Everyone--Batman, the
villains, the People of Gotham--is bored, except the police who are kept busy
because everyone else is so bored they keep committing crimes. The dominance
of boredom as a theme in <em>Batman </em>comics brings about a discussion of
motivations. Is boredom a motivation in <em>Batman</em>? Does the Batman come
about as a result of the boredom that consumes the lonely, but filthy-rich,
Bruce Wayne? Taking Umberto Eco's ideas in the <em>Myth of Superman </em>as a
starting point, there's an argument to be made that says modern comicbook
superheroes are not only "inconsumable," they're stuck in perpetual boredom
as a result. Boredom, or having time on one's hands, is an essential
component of the comicbook superhero. Even their jobs--usually as newspaper
reporters / photographers, or independently wealthy scientists--allow for big
chunks of unoccupied time where boredom leads to fantastic creativity,
particularly in the manufacture of skills, weaponry, and the collection,
implementation, and amassing of intelligence. In short, boredom is the
superhero's trump card.

	<!--more-->

	The header of the first <em>Batman</em> story runs as follows: "The
'Bat-Man.' A mysterious and adventurous figure, fighting for righteousness
and apprehending the wrong doer, in his lone battle against the evil forces
of society... his identity remains unknown." We are then introduced to "The
home of commissioner Gordon, who at the moment is entertaining his young
socialite friend, Bruce Wayne." Wayne, smoking a pipe and leaning dejectedly
on his palm, asks Gordon, "Well commissioner, anything exciting happening
these days?" Mimicking the set-up of Sherlock Holmes in which Holmes is
utterly bored with nothing to do, the comic introduces a murder and the
detective narrative is off. But it all starts as a cure for boredom, not the
need to impose a higher moral purpose and understanding. As soon as the
action heats up in the story, Bruce Wayne grows bored, and, tapping out his
pipe, he tells Gordon: "Ho Hum! I'll leave you here to finish your work...
I'm going home." Of course, much action occurs afterward with Batman solving,
and explaining how he solved, the case. The end of the story comes after
Bruce Wayne visits the commissioner again and, after listening to Gordon's
recounting of the previous night's affair, remarks, "Hmm, a very lovely
fairy-tale commissioner indeed." The commissioner, lighting a celebratory
cigar after Wayne has left, mutters, "Bruce Wayne is a nice chap, but he
certainly must lead a boring life... seems disinterested in everything." The
final two frames of the story reveal Bruce Wayne as the Batman. The irony
isn't lost on the reader: Bruce Wayne isn't bored or disinterested, he's The
Bat-Man!

	All this to note that at the beginning of the next story, the preamble
reads a little differently: "The 'Bat-Man,' a mysterious and adventurous
figure, fighting for righteousness and apprehending the menaces of society in
his lone battle against the evil. His identity remains unknown (He is one
Bruce Wayne, bored young socialite.)" Boredom, then, has become one of the
primary descriptors of The Bat-Man's identity. To take it a step further, one
of the primary reasons Bruce Wayne fights crime is because he's bored. As
noted in a <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2011/06/13/27-batman-origins-and-
revisions/">previous post</a>, at the earlier stages of the <em>Batman</em>
comic book, we don't yet have the revenge origin story. In the beginning,
there was boredom without revenge.

	Batman's boredom is an alibi, it allows him to protect his secret
identity (how could someone so boring be the Batman?), and, later, it masks a
deep-seated moral righteousness that fuels his on-going quest for revenge. He
is someone who has it all, except excitment in his life. Even his coterie of
villans lack motivation after a while and exist solely to get the
Batman--they're all so bored with petty crimes they need to make things
personal. Frank Miller has The Joker so bored he's in a coma for a decade
because the Bat-Man retires.

	What boredom tells us about Superheroes is that their motivations were,
and are, not always about doing the right thing, or taking the moral high
ground (no matter how tenuously). Instead, our heroes sometimes typify the
crisis of modern life: filling those moments where there's nothing to do with
something meaningful. The moral of these tales might well be that if you're
bored, as so many kids then and now are, go out and do something righteous
and mysterious, not criminal.

	Moreover, Batman's bored alter-ego represents a counter-point to the
exciting, dangerous, life of a crime-fighter. It conveys a lack of
seriousness about something (crime, impetus, disguise) that is usually seen
as a very serious matter. Our heroes have a sense of flippancy and
irreverence that we often miss in our suspension of disbelief. How our heroes
cope with, and dispatch, their boredom is as much a morality tale as is
fighting crime.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Perhaps the most
striking feature of the Batman: Year One story arc by Frank Miller and David
Mazzucchelli is how little Batman is in it. He’s there alright, but his story
of trying out his skills on the streets of the East Side of Gotham and
discovering his bat-based superhero identity plays second fiddle to the
existential crisis of Lieutenant James Gordon, who has just been transferred
to Gotham from Chicago. Gordon is thrown into a department that is corrupt
from the Commissioner on down; his marriage is in crisis; and he’s about to
become a father. While Bruce Wayne’s memory of the childhood trauma of 
seeing his parents killed by a petty criminal appears in the narrative, his
present, apart from being stabbed and shot from time to time, is untroubled.
All the angst belongs to Gordon.

	<!--more-->

	Year One tells the story of James Gordon and Bruce Wayne/Batman forming
their partnership in an alternating, initially parallel structure. Each
character provides an internal voice over, Gordon in yellow (nicotine
stained?) text boxes and Wayne/Batman in white. The establishing panels show
Gordon taking the train from Chicago to Gotham while Bruce Wayne flies into
the city after twelve years abroad. Gordon has a window seat in a jammed
train car that he’s been on for 12 hours. The woman beside him is
breast-feeding a child (symbolic perhaps of Gordon’s impending paternity);
people are sleeping and checking their watches; luggage bins are jammed
overhead. These details show that Gordon is down “in” the world, enmeshed in
it, trapped in it. Reality is too much with him. Wayne, meanwhile, is above
this world and its discomforts: “From here, it’s clean shafts of concrete and
snowy rooftops.... From here it looks like an achievement.”

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Trains-and-
Planes1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-591" title="Trains
and Planes"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Trains-and-
Planes1.jpg" alt="" width="718" height="618" /></a> <p style="text-align:
center;">&nbsp;</p> And when Wayne thinks to himself that he should have
taken the train to get closer to Gotham’s reality, it only illustrates his
voyeuristic desire to go slumming. When he takes himself to the extra-corrupt
East Side to test his crime-fighting skills, the effect is the same. Miller
and Mazzucchelli maintain this contrast between the characters and their
worlds until the very end of the narrative when they come together to form an
alliance.  So the story of Batman: Year One is that of a relationship between
two men with two different realities that dictate their motivations and
abilities to act. Gordon needs Batman as a kind of extra-legal supplement
while Bruce Wayne needs Gordon to give birth to Batman and ground him in the
world of crime and the law.

	&nbsp; <p style="text-align: left;">Gordon is an archetypal tough cop
hero: disgusted yet incorruptible, but not above taking out a little
extracurricular vengeance on fellow officers who do him wrong. But Gordon’s
private life creates the narrative tension, not his struggle against
corruption. His disgust with the world makes him wonder whether family life
is even possible. With a patriarchal arrogance, he doubts whether evil
Gotham, and the larger world that it represents, is a place for women and
children.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Why1.jpg"><
img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-593" title="Why"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Why1.jpg"
alt="" width="766" height="242" /></a></p> <p style="text-align:
left;">Furthermore, he and Barbara fight constantly.... Things don’t look
good. In spite of his efforts to stay faithful to Barbara, Gordon finds
himself attracted to Detective Sarah Essen. They go out for coffee regularly
after work and end up kissing in the rain <span style="color:
#ff0000;">[1]</span>. Police Commissioner Loeb tries to use this relationship
to blackmail Gordon but Gordon nullifies the threat by coming clean with
Barbara.</p> &nbsp;

	Lieutenant Gordon is tangled up in both the gritty world of crime and the
complicated world of domesticity that ultimately justifies fighting crime in
the first place. Gordon represents the tangle, the knot of existence that
makes us act. Bruce Wayne, in contrast, is free of all that. He has no job,
and he has a butler, not a spouse. His disengagement highlights Gordon’s
entanglement all the more, as Gordon’s visit to Wayne Manor shows. For some
reason, Gordon brings Barbara along as he tries to figure out whether Wayne
could be Batman: “Better than having Barbara stay at home and worry about
being so overdue...” (4.8.1). Bruce appears in a dressing gown next to a
lingerie-clad woman whom he says doesn’t speak any language he understands.
While it is obvious that Wayne is putting up a front here--portraying himself
as a dissipated playboy who couldn’t possibly be Batman--the fact that he is
able to put up such a front says it all. He has no romantic entanglements to
drag him into the domestic world, unlike Gordon, who must live in the world
of affairs, babies, and marriage counsellors. The problem with Bruce Wayne’s
freedom/disengagement is that it doesn’t legitimate his actions. Crime
fighting becomes just a peculiar and perhaps perverse hobby.

	&nbsp; <p style="text-align: left;">Selina Kyle, who transforms into
Catwoman after seeing Batman on the news, represents an intermediate space
between Gordon and Wayne<span style="color: #ff0000;"> [2].</span> Selina, a
dominatrix/prostitute, not only has a multitude of cats, which gives rise to
a nice cat lady/Catwoman visual joke, but also a “ward” in Holly Robinson, a
teenaged prostitute. Selina is both a part of the “vice” of the city and a
person with ties, however makeshift. Again, by contrast, we see that Bruce
Wayne has no one to look after, not even a cat.  Indeed, the only other
person in his life, Alfred, looks after him, nursing his wounds and fetching
his tights <span style="color: #ff0000;">[3]</span>. Bruce Wayne meets Holly
and Selena as he cruises the East Side of Gotham, looking for some criminals
to test his skills on. Even though he takes steps to disguise himself, Bruce
is clearly out of place and his disguise is not convincing. Holly’s pimp
makes him for a cop.<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Holly.jpg"><
img class="size-medium wp-image-581 aligncenter" title="Holly"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Holly-300x267.
jpg" alt="" width="300" height="267" /></a> And when Bruce tackles the pimp,
Holly stabs him in the thigh in punishment for his outsider meddling. Without
his “otherworldly” bat persona, Bruce Wayne is a flop as a crime fighter; he
is another trouble maker in a bad neighborhood <span style="color:
#ff0000;">[4]</span>. A costume and persona, however, are only part of what
he requires. Mostly he needs a connection, an investment. Without them, he is
just a bored socialite working out his psychodrama in public.</p> <p
style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align:
left;">Consequently, Miller and Mazzucchelli set up the climax of Batman Year
One in a way that makes the public and the private converge as it brings
Gordon and Batman together as a team. When Commissioner Loeb’s attempt to
blackmail Gordon fails, The Roman, a gangster with his fingers in the pie of
city politics, sends his nephew Johnny to kidnap Gordon’s newborn. In
assigning the task, The Roman says, “Once a man becomes a father he is never
truly free” (4.16.5). <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/A-Father-is-
Never-Free.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-583 aligncenter" title="A
Father is Never Free"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/A-Father-is-
Never-Free-257x300.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="300" /></a>The domesticity
that entangles Gordon in the conventions of domestic reality becomes the tool
to entangle him in the corruption that everyone else in the Gotham police
department and city politics partakes in. On that level, the baby is symbol
of Gordon’s commitment to marriage, fatherhood, domesticity. The baby itself
is a kind of entanglement.</p> &nbsp;

	But the baby also represents a fresh start, a freedom from corruption
that the kidnapping would taint. If the kidnapping is successful Gordon’s
bleak assessment of Gotham comes true: it is no place for a child. So if
Batman doesn’t save the baby, any notion of the city being worth saving dies.
But Batman isn’t the saviour here, Bruce Wayne is. When Alfred offers to
fetch his tights prior to his intervening in the kidnapping, Bruce says,
“never during the day” (4.16.3). Bruce Wayne as Bruce Wayne saves the baby
because the symbol of Batman requires something connected to domestic reality
behind it, an alter ego who has some connection to the world that James
Gordon lives in every day. When I say “requires” here I mean that Batman Year
One suffers an anxiety that Batman will be (and perhaps has been)
disconnected from reality, and that this story of beginnings intends to
ensure the connection between the superhero and social realism. The irony
here is that Miller and Mazzucchelli make the connection to realism
symbolically. When Bruce Wayne emerges from the mud of the river proffering
the baby to Gordon, it signifies that connection. This is not a sci-fi
fantasy world of formidable evil powers threatening the planet <span
style="color: #ff0000;">[5]</span>. Rather, it is a world of everyday
problems of people trying to make it in a corrupt political world. So...Bruce
Wayne needs to save the baby that links those worlds to legitimate Batman’s
functioning. Once Bruce saves Gordon’s baby and through doing so establishes
a “relationship” with the lieutenant, Batman, as a meaningful symbol, can
begin to work to save Gotham.

	&nbsp;

	Bruce is not just meddling here, he’s giving birth to something, a
symbolic transaction with Gordon that is a deal to work together to keep
public corruption and crime from infecting the domestic world. Gordon gives
Wayne an investment in the personal, domestic realm where people have bonds
with each other, and Wayne provides Gordon a “deus ex machina” to fight
corruption and crime in Gotham.  In the symbolic sense, the baby is theirs,
and the muddy waters of the river provide an appropriate birthing scene. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Baby-Exchange
.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-582" title="Baby Exchange"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Baby-Exchange-
300x132.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="132" /></a>The narrative ends with
news of a threat to poison the Gotham Reservoir: “Calls himself the Joker.”
The final image is of Gordon smiling, and smoking a pipe: “I’ve got a friend
coming who might be able to help. Should be here any minute” (4. 25.5). It’s
the first time in the story that we have seen Gordon with any level of
contentment. And, with Bruce Wayne having stitched himself into the social
fabric through his baby rescue, Batman can be freed to fight the wacko
villains one only finds in comic books.

	&nbsp;

	[1] In a neat allusive moment, Gordon and Essen have coffee in a diner
called “The Hopper”.

	[2] It’s curious that Selina Kyle gets no internal monologue/ voice over
like the male characters. Why not? How does the Catwoman element of the story
fit in?

	[3] Alfred represents the butler as masculine mother.

	[4] Part of the Batman mythology concerns why Bruce Wayne needs a costume
to fight crime, how it is necessary for him to become a symbol. We might
argue that “becoming symbol” is a kind of absolution from the social world.

	[5] The “goofy” world of Batman that we see most prominently in the campy
Adam West TV show is contained in Commissioner Loeb’s office, which is
stuffed with pop memorabilia, including a “Peanuts” lamp.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[A confession before I
begin: I never really liked Batman.  (I know, he's crushed.)  I always found
him, like Superman, too perfect to root for.  Like, oh, great, your
superpower is tons of money, awesome.  So thrilled for you.  Somehow, to my
childmind, being bitten by a radioactive spider seemed infinitely more
possible than inheriting an untold fortune.  There was nothing to cheer for
in Batman, to me, and so he didn't hold my interest.

	That said, as much as I dislike Batman, I totally love Grant Morrison and
Frank Quitely -- they have a partnership that works incredibly well, whether
in the disturbing and distressing <em>We3</em>, the confusing but exciting
<em>JLA: Earth 2</em>, or my recent favourite, their successful attempt to
breathe new and more interesting life into Superman in <em>All-Star
Superman</em>.  So when tasked with writing about Batman for this Graphixia
round, there was really one one place to go: Grant Morrison's <em>Batman and
Robin</em> series, with the first three issues illustrated by Frank Quitely.

	<!--more--><img class="alignright"
src="http://www.66batman.com/yabbfiles/Attachments/
funny_Batman_comic_strip_humor.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="400" />I had
to do a fair amount of background reading to get up to speed, though, since
I'd been away from the Caped Crusader -- movies featuring Christian Bale's
stupid BatVoice excluded -- for quite some time.  <em>Batman and Robin</em>
appears after Morrison's <em>Batman: RIP</em> and <em>Battle for the Black
Cowl</em> runs, and after the DC world event <em>Final Crisis</em>. At this
point in the narrative, Batman is dead.  Well, okay, really he's "dead," but
the important thing is that he isn't around fighting crime anymore.  To fill
the vacuum, there has been a fair amount of shuffling of the BatDeck -- which
opens up a space for this series to be a fantastic metacommentary on the idea
of the superhero as more role than man.  (Which nicely continues on from the
most recent episode of The More Trivial the Better, coming to an iPod near
you soon.)

	See, Gotham needs Batman.  The city can't function without him. Good old
Commissioner Gordon can't keep up and the criminals are riding roughshod over
the city.  So they need Batman.  Or, more to the point, they need <em>a</em>
Batman, which is where things get a little interesting.

	Richard "Dick" Grayson was once Robin, but he got too old for the role
and eventually branched out on his own as Nightwing.  He remained connected
to the BatFamily, though, and supported Tim Drake's desire to be the new
Robin.  (In between, Jason Todd was Robin -- but he got murdered and then was
alive again but turned out to be crazy evil, so nevermind.  He's back as a
villain in this series.)  After Batman's death ("death"), Tim Drake is
convinced that Batman is alive and takes off, now as Red Robin, to track him
down.  Damian Wayne, Batman's son -- I know, I know, more backstory I'm not
getting into -- takes on the role of Robin, and Nightwing becomes Batman.

	So. Dick Grayson -&gt; Robin -&gt; Nightwing -&gt; Batman.  Jason Todd
-&gt; Robin -&gt; Red Hood -&gt; Evil.  Tim Drake -&gt; Robin -&gt; Red
Robin.  Damian Wayne -&gt; Robin.  Everyone on the same page?

	<img class="alignleft"

jpg" alt="" width="321" height="585" />

	It's made real for us here just how important the uniform is and, by
extension, how unimportant the individual is.  The resident of each suit is
transient; so long as the role is filled, Gotham is protected.

	It doesn't feel that way to Dick Grayson, though.  He's distressed by the
sense that the police don't take him seriously and by his difficulties
controlling Damian/Robin.  Dick/Batman feels out of place, and while the suit
conveys strength and protection to the residents of Gotham, it evokes only
feelings of fraud in the wearer in this case.  Dick/Batman is nearly
paralyzed by his desire to uphold the values Bruce Wayne's Batman stood for,
which allows this series to offer a space to ask what role the role itself
plays -- how much flexibility can there ever be in what Batman is?  And what
about Robin?  And Dick/Batman is so convinced that he cannot fill these shoes
that he attempts to resurrect Bruce/Batman, and instead finds himself nearly
killed by a BatReplica Zombie in a Batman-on-Zombie-Batman-and-also-BatGirl
disorienting juggernaut bout.

	As Gordon says, this new Batman is "different, maybe... but familiar."

	This question of role and flexibility is brought into focus through the
contrast with Damian/Robin.  Damian's grandfather is Ra's al Ghul, a Batman
universe villain, and he represents a struggle between good and evil.  But
with Damian, the good is imposed by Bruce Wayne -- his last ("last") wish is
for Damian to not kill anyone -- and the desire to harm and destroy is
difficult to ignore.  We see in issue 3, for example, that Damian eschews
protecting and helping the victims of a villain in favour of pursuing the
villain for vengeance.  Can you be Robin if you're secretly evil?  But
Damian, by following his father to Wayne Manor, has made a move to directly
reject his mother's side of the family and the evil in that lineage.  He is
left not quite sure where he fits, especially should his sojourn as Robin not
work out.

	In issues two and three, we see the metaphorical issue of identity and
selfhood emerge ever more clearly with the return of the villain Professor
Pyg, whose horror and villainy of choice is to replace a living victim's face
with a doll mask, thus rendering him/her "perfect" in Pyg's eyes and erasing
any selfhood or identity, at the same time installing a kind of zombiefying
mind-control; while Batman and Robin are struggling to fill their new roles
and understand their new identities, they must hunt down a villain who
specializes in the destruction of identity.  Deep, right?

	And then we are given another villain, Flamingo, interested only in
skinning and eating the faces of his victims.  And another villain whose face
is on fire, and when people rush to help them, he burns them too.  Faces are
under assault in this series, standing in as representations of the trouble
with identity inherent to the superhero role swap.

	<img class="alignright"
src="http://data.whicdn.com/images/9581313/batman,funny,sign,creative,haha,
nice-d5fbd3c974baa690afb471ccf56a9c2d_h_large.jpg?1304890135" alt=""
width="400" height="266" />One way Morrison has played with identity in this
version of Batman is by reversing the personalities of Batman and Robin.
 Where previous Robins provided the comic relief to Bruce Wayne's intensity
as Batman, Dick/Batman here is the comic one, undercutting the (occasionally
frightening) intensity of Damian/Robin.  This flip is indicative the
discomfort both men feel in their new roles: Dick never wanted to replace
Batman and so shies away from adopting his personality; Damian, conversely,
wanted to take over his father's legacy on his own and resents the sidekick
role (going so far as to try and change the team moniker to Robin and
Batman).

	Morrison gives the vigilante Red Hood -- Jason Todd, former Robin --
awareness of Batman's existence as more brand and image than reality; he
tells us Batman is "a brand, a logo, an idea gone past its sell-by date.
 We're the competition.  We're making him obsolete, like the iPod killed the
Walkman."  Todd studies marketing strategy and stages a viral media assault
(complete with webcams) against Batman to demonstrate that the role is only
what it is defined as by society -- something Dick Grayson is painfully aware
of.  And Todd, we realize, does all of this because he couldn't take on the
black cowl himself: he could never replace Batman as much as he may have
wished it.  So he is stuck battling for an identity of his own.

	Faced with the return of the "dead" Batman, Dick/Batman and Damian/Robin
are forced to renegotiate identities once again. This time, it's easier for
Dick, who can return to his role as Nightwing.  Damian, conversely, wonders
if he will be allowed to remain Robin once his father, and presumably Tim,
return.  Ultimately, it is here where Damian finds some common ground with
Dick -- they both find that they need a role, a costume, or a cape to wrap
themselves in and shape who they are. Without that, neither man is fully
whole.

	But what happens when you have too many heros and not enough
capes?]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Not to play devil’s
advocate to our last poster, but Batman has always been the superhero with
whom I’ve identified and connected with the most out of the plethora of those
characters who exist in both DC and Marvel comics – this could be because he
appears the most realistic, with powers that are based predominantly on
excessive training and technologies which, albeit specious, don’t disrupt my
reality too greatly (and great wealth has always been a more realistic
fantasy for me than the ability to fly). More likely, however, it’s because
Batman was the first superhero I’d ever read about, having picked up a
tattered copy of Miller’s collected <em>Dark Knight Returns</em> in my local
library at eight years old, reading it in a single sitting and held rapt by
the stark, gritty nature of the character and the dialogue. Though I’ve since
learned to approach the text from a more academic standpoint, I don’t think I
will ever feel as drawn to Batman – or the superhero genre on the whole – as
I did during that first encounter with a world in which justice could be
brought to chaos given enough willpower, determination, fanaticism and a
sense of responsibility to effect change where one finds often overwhelming
inequities. I felt that I understood Batman’s origin and his motivations
fully from this single story, allowing me complete and definitive access to
Batman as a character.<!--more-->

	This said, what I first encountered in <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>
was not actually Batman at all – Batman had thrived in DC comics for nearly
fifty years prior to Miller’s revisioning of the character at the end of his
career, embittered but emboldened by the unswerving social decline of
Gotham’s streets and youth. <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>, a miniseries
that, along with the release of <em>Watchmen</em>, prompted DC to fill its
UPC  boxes on the direct market editions of its entire line of titles with:
“DC Comics: they’re not just for kids anymore,” was the first step in a
dramatic undertaking by the publisher to remove heroes from their original
contexts and provide them with familiar supporting characters and situations
while approaching them in a way that was different, sometimes dramatically,
from the worlds which the readers knew and had expectations for regarding
continuity. Marvel had been attempting this several years prior with its line
of <em>What If…?</em> - currently at issue #200 - in which key events in the
Marvel Universe are explored from the perspective of hypothetical, alternate
outcomes (such as “What if Wolverine had killed the Hulk?” reworking the
events of Wolverine’s first appearance in <em>Incredible Hulk #181</em>). The
advent of <em>What If…?</em> is significant in that it showcases the
importance of continuity for comics’ readership, a point on which I’ve posted
before – there would be no interest or upset if the details of characters’
origins and running histories had not already been so engrained in readers’
minds, a constant of how they approach each subsequent issue throughout the
Universe’s line of titles. My personal situation was oddly reversed, however;
I encountered the revision and had to later piece together the original,
scouring for and collecting the texts that defined the character that Miller,
in his adaptation, redefined so well.

	When DC attempted its own first, tenuous version of What If…? in the<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Gotham-By-
Gaslight.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-613" title="Gotham By
Gaslight"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Gotham-By-
Gaslight.png" alt="" width="179" height="281" /></a> form of <em>The Dark
Knight Returns</em>, the response was significant and has since become, some
argue, the entry point for Batman into the academy. Instead of offering a
single title devoted to revising key events, DC released one-shots, most
frequently presented in squarebound, relatively expensive prestige format
issues written and drawn by comicdom’s most important writers of the day.
Batman, being arguably DC’s flagship character, was at the core of this new
approach – <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em> had gained so much critical
acclaim that it only made sense to continue using this character for its
continuity bending initiatives. The first of these was <em>Gotham by
Gaslight</em>, which incorporated a Victorian styled, steampunk Batman into
the mythology of Jack the Ripper, as Batman pursues a copycat killer in
Gotham and, of course, eventually brings him to justice. Written and drawn by
Mike Mignola and Brian Augustyn, <em>Gaslight</em> has been reprinted
multiple times and now thrives as a hardcover edition, appended by the
author’s notes and storyboards and its sequel, <em>Batman: Master of the
Future</em>. It is one of the texts, alongside <em>The Dark Knight
Returns</em>, <em>Arkham Asylum</em> and <em>The Killing Joke</em>, most
frequently taught in academic courses featuring Batman, and it has
implications that redefined the genre of superhero storytelling.

" alt="" width="79" height="72" /></a>That <em>Dark Knight</em> and
<em>Gaslight</em> were both critical<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Holy-Terror.
png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-615" title="Holy Terror"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Holy-Terror.
png" alt="" width="113" height="173" /></a> successes prompted the imprint,
still running to this day, of DC’s <em>Elseworlds</em>. Each of these titles
showcased the <em>Elseworlds</em> logo and read, on the back cover, "In
<em>Elseworlds</em>, heroes are taken from their usual settings and put into
strange times and places — some that have existed, and others that can't,
couldn't or shouldn't exist. The result is stories that make characters who
are as familiar as yesterday seem as fresh as tomorrow." In these titles,
authors were free to move outside the rigid bounds of continuity and rework
characters entirely as they saw fit. Batman is the central figure in the
majority of <em>Elseworld</em> titles, with notable examples being <em>Holy
Terror</em>, which supposes a theocratic America based on the religious
beliefs of Oliver Cromwell, and the more recent, Eisner Award winning
<em>Batman: Year One Hundred</em>, a <em>Dark Knight Returns</em>-styled
portrayal of a future Batman, beset by similar governmental and social ills.
Currently numbering at close to fifty different titles featuring Batman
(though there are many more concentrating on other DC characters), these
<em>Elseworlds</em> stories often draw from the rich backgrounds of the
authors who crafted them, placing Batman anywhere from the French Revolution
to the distant future. Most importantly, however, these titles always sketch
out a new origin for the character, a reboot through which readers can access
the familiar yet different and an entirely self contained story.

	The existence and success of <em>Elseworlds</em> titles highlights two
important functions (other than the telling of normally fascinating and
inspired stories) in the comics’ greater universe. Firstly, these tales offer
an avenue for new readers to become familiar with a canon that can often be
so complex that it denies the casual reader any sense of familiarity or
identification. Working within the contained universe of the
<em>Elseworlds</em> story, the reader, becoming comfortable, can then work
backwards (as I did) to rediscover the original, being the template on which
the revision was based<a name="sdfootnote1anc"
href="#sdfootnote1sym"><sup>1</sup></a>. The establishing of this avenue is
significant, as the decades rich, ostracizing nature of comics’ universes
requires these frequent fissures in order to gain readers and continue to
publish – besides <em>Elseworlds</em> and <em>What If…?</em>, we see this in
Marvel’s <em>Ultimate</em> line and DC’s (albeit short lived) recent <em>All
Star</em> line. Secondly, these exceptions are what ultimately help to define
the canon on the whole. Canon, in literature as well as in superhero comics,
is solidified by what is outside of it; recalling (though reductively) one of
the key features of semiotics, we understand best what something is by
determining what it is not. Similarly, DC’s attempt to make characters “seem
as fresh as tomorrow” actually has the markedly opposite effect, further
engraining who and what a character is by putting pressure on him from the
outside, highlighting what <em>he</em> is not. The fracturing of continuity
through a prism of varied hypothetical circumstances paradoxically serves to
make the fictional reality of the narrative that much more grounded.

	The <em>Elseworlds</em> Batman stories are arguably the most entertaining
for those who find them an affront to the reality that they have come to
accept for the character (the recent complexity of which was very nicely
summarized in last week’s post). While offering access to new readers, they
also serve the opposite function of justifying the close reading of long-time
followers of the hero, those who are intimately familiar with the minutiae of
plot and character development over the years. My personal experience with
the character is a case in point – I began on the fringes of the DCU and was
compelled by the fact that I had mapped out a contained universe in one
volume. Entering the title(s) on the whole, I found a far richer, more
complex environment that similarly housed a definite world, with characters
that could be mapped and traced onto an often byzantine canon that, while
sometimes fantastic and carrying the quirks of any multi-authored work, was
also stable and just as defined as any other single text. <div

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[As the catchy title
suggests, this post is about women and comic books. It’s also about exclusion
and inclusion. Comic book fans like to talk about how "inclusive" and
"collaboratory" the medium is; a rich melange of artists, writers,
colourists, and inkers: story-tellers all. Comic book readers are well
informed, well read, and well aware of most intricacies a critic might
examine. There’s no doubt that the community around comic books is an
enlightened and contemplative group, exemplified by their devotion to the
medium and the craft of creating it. But…

	<!--more-->

	Conversations about comic book characters tend to centre on discussions
of exclusion—how Peter Parker is a nerdy kid who we all identify with, who
doesn't "belong." How any one of us could be Superman if we could just shed
our Clark Kent cookie-cutter goodie work-a-day suits and take to the radical,
rarefied air of physical dominance unconscious of how others perceive us.
We’re all super in disguise. We all want to belong, but we’re part of a
marginalized sub-set who read comic books in bed, with a flashlight, alone.
We know there are others like us and we seek them out and, in the end, we
"belong": "Comic Book Nerds" all. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Emma-Frost.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-629" title="Emma-Frost"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Emma-Frost.jpg
" alt="Emma Frost w/ her legs spread" width="220" height="333" /></a></p>
However, anyone who has had the misfortune of walking into a comic book store
knows, the community that says it is all about sharing, can be all about
exclusion too. In fact, being a comic book fan is often an egotistical gambit
that highlights esoteric knowledge and obscene collections. There isn’t
another place on earth other than perhaps inside the IT department of your
most recent employer that attacks the ignorant, but eager, more than the
collected masses of the comic book store. For all its representations of the
marginalized geek, the comic book encourages the same pack-rat behaviours the
comic fan deplores in the jocks and “normals” who persecute them in everyday
life. Comic books don't encourage acceptance, they encourage exclusion and
exclusivity—the very same things that self-described comic book nerds often
say led them to comic book stories (and stores) in the first place. And, the
clearest example of this exclusionary tendency is nowhere more evident than
in comic book representations of women. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/WonderWoman.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-626" title="WonderWoman"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/WonderWoman.
jpg" alt="Wonder Woman w/ hips out and lasso" width="211" height="420"
/></a></p> Often approached through an analysis of comic book readership,
which is predominantly male, the representation of women in comic books
prioritizes a particular type of form and substance. Furthermore, the comic
book fan rarely—though they would argue stringently the opposite—accepts a
divergent storyline, so committed are they to the cyclical narratives and
stories of the genre (how many times have we heard about Batman’s origins?).
For all its talk of marginalized representation, the superhero comic book
tends to represent adolescent (or “mature adolescent”) characters who are
white, middle or upper class, and marginalized not by race, creed, religion,
sex, or sexual orientation, but because of their adroit intelligence or lack
of social skills; and we see this fundamental architecture over and over
again even though the stories and characters might change. Even when other
marginalized figures—those marginalized by race, creed, etc.—are present,
they tend to embody the stereotypes that white, middle or upper class, social
misfits most fear. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Catwoman.jpg"
><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-627" title="Catwoman"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Catwoman.jpg"
alt="Catwoman and Boobies" width="240" height="179" /></a></p> If we
concentrate on female representations in comic books, for now, we must ask
two questions: 1) where are the women? And 2) where are the “ordinary” women.
There are lots of extraordinary women; extraordinarily beautiful, dangerous,
perceptive, and invisible. That last one is the giveaway. Not only are
females (and I am using that term on purpose here, to belabor the point)
under-represented, but they are also, in the grand tradition, usually
sculpted from a dominant, authentic, primary (you pick) “male” version.
Female superheroes with similar names to their male counterparts abound: Ms.
Marvel, Marvel Girl, Supergirl / Woman, Batgirl / Woman, Spider-Woman. Even
somewhat original names are eclipsed by their semantic closeness: “Wonder”
Woman, “Cat” Woman, “Panther” Girl, all of which suggest associations to
Batman or Superman or the "Boy" Wonder. Even names like “Storm” and “Rogue”
suggest the climatic conditions of the pre-menstrual cycle, or the
cringe-worthy clicking wink of a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mama_grizzly">Mama-Grizzly-shootin' Sarah
Palin</a>. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Storm.jpg"><
img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-637" title="Storm"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Storm.jpg"
alt="Storm: &quot;I'm coming!&quot;" width="240" height="180" /></a></p> A
websites such as “<a href="http://www.unheardtaunts.com/wir/">Women in
Refrigerators</a>” is well worth a look for <a
href="http://www.unheardtaunts.com/wir/women.html">examples</a> of the way
female disfigurement and disempowerment jump start story lines for male
superheroes. Even a quick review of the superpowers possessed by female
superheroes reveals a mail sack of patriarchal cliches and masculine
insecurities surrounding the powers of the “other,” or “opposite” sex.
Invisibility (Sue Storm, Fantastic Four) is particularly appropriate given
the marginalized position of women historically, as is Jean Grey’s power to
read the mind (Emma Frost also comes to mind) and Wonder Woman’s ability to
force her foes into telling the truth is a big concern for any philandering
(or golf playing while supposed to be working) Alpha Male. One prolonged
touch from “Rogue” leaves  a man hovering near death! <p style="text-align:
center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Rogue-X-Men.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-635" title="Rogue (X-Men)"

jpg" alt="Rogue - &quot;Don't Touch Me!&quot;" width="180" height="253"
/></a></p> And then there’s the costumes. An obvious point of attack which
the pictures in the this post have been driving home as you’ve been reading.
One look at Power Girl’s enormous breasts would render most, male or female,
gay or straight, stunned. What Kryptonite could possibly foil those breasts!?
Sure, some will quickly say that the costumes reflect a “male” readership and
a “male” authorship; whatever, admit it, the costumes of most female
superheroes reflect stereotypes and representations of the worst kind. Would
we accept a Black Superhero who used Ebonics or Crack Cocaine to disable his
foes and had a costume that barely contained his enormous, engorged, smooth,
penis (just imagine seeing almost all of that penis, but its throbbing head)?
According to the evidence in this post, sure we would accept it! <p

" alt="Power Girl / Power Boobies" width="240" height="346" /></a></p> Female
superheroes are almost always cousins or sisters or kin of some male
superhero. Rarely are they generative, rarely do they deal with the contexts
so prevalent in male superheroes: marginalization, social insecurity, sexual
inadequacies, a need to perform the moral right. All this leaves a lingering
issue for comic book fans, one they might not want to admit they have:
they’re exclusionary. Both the creators—by representing like they do—and the
fans—for accepting and condoning marginalized representations like they
do—are putting forward a particular kind of representation whose primary
characteristics are exactly those they so deplore and which caused them to
withdraw. Comics are hardly open and collaborative; they verge on the
offensive in a way that Peter Parker could never conceive (boy, I bet he has
a small penis). <p style="text-align: center;"><a

fun_home_peter_01.jpg" alt="Picture of Alison Bechdel's Father in Fun Home"
width="346" height="304" /></a></p> In closing, one of the dominant
post-superhero modes for comics is undoubtedly the memoir, a narrative form
that, for women, seems to come to the fore in response to the male lead of
comics authors such as Art Spiegelman, Chris Ware, and Will Eisner, all of
whom come at the non-superhero comic through memoir. One example of the
parallel currents in subject matter or its mode of presentation is Alison
Bechdel’s <em>Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic</em> in which Bechdel revisits
her father’s “lost” history, a narrative perspective used by Spiegelman to
great acclaim in <em>Maus</em>. We can only hope that this similar mode—right
down to dealing with “fathers” is the beginning of a more symbiotic
relationship between women and comics books; one in which they have their own
voices and representations beside their male counterparts (or collaborators).
However, it does seem as though female writers desperately need to find a
voice that screams outside the shadows of male-dominated forms and formats
for the comic and character that truly reflect a female voice (whatever might
distinguish it) in order to for comics to have any established legitimacy as
a primary medium for creative expression in the twenty first
century.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

src="http://www.allysonlatta.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Sarah-
Leavitt-Tangles-Jacket-front1-256x300.jpg" alt="" width="256" height="300"
/>Sarah Leavitt's graphic memoir, <em>Tangles: A Story about Alzheimer's, My
Mother, and Me</em>, looks deceptively simple at first glance.  The sparse,
line-art images are entirely in black and white, and the framing of each
panel is drawn to the required size but the borders are not transgressed.  It
looks very traditional for a slice-of-life comic.

	But the joy of <em>Tangles</em> -- and there is joy throughout this
difficult, sad, and painful memoir -- comes from the hidden complexity in
these images and the nuanced way Leavitt examines her own conflicted feelings
through the visual.  Though a first glance might suggest that the images in
<em>Tangles</em> are secondary to the story, in reality Leavitt's work is so
good because of the flawless intermingling of words and images, where the
images challenge and belie the words.

	I think of this as a perfect example of the graphic memoir genre.

	But I'm getting ahead of myself.

	<!--more-->

	<em>Tangles</em> is Sarah Leavitt's memoir of watching her mother succumb
to Alzheimer's disease.  Intensely personal and honest, Leavitt details her
experiences of watching her educated, intelligent mother lose her faculties.
 She deals openly with the family's early denial, troubles coping, and
conflicted feelings of relief.  The memoir is, at it's core, a sensitive and
moving portrayal of Leavitt's mother, Midge.  But it's also a portrait of a
family in pain and a daughter in deep flux.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mom_drawing.
jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-672" title="mom_drawing"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mom_drawing-
300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>There is distance,
physical and emotional, between Leavitt and her family.  They are in
Fredericton while she is in Vancouver.  Leavitt's parents are culturally
Jewish but do not practice.  Though they are liberal, their community is not,
and Leavitt must leave Fredericton to discover and embrace her sexuality as a
lesbian.  (On the other hand, Leavitt's sister becomes more conservative,
eventually marrying an Orthodox Jewish man.)  These spaces between the
characters allow for the reader to examine a series of internal tensions that
trouble and define Leavitt's character as depicted in the memoir.

	As I said before, the images and text are in a constant conversation with
one another, and occasionally they seem to disagree.  This serves to
underscore a central motif in the text: internal tension.  Leavitt's
character in the text is caught between her desire to help and nurse her
mother and her own feelings of impatience with her decline; her desire to
disagree with care choices made by her father and sister and her guilt at
being the absent daughter; her need to be with her mother and her relief upon
each return to Vancouver.  There are contrasts throughout that demonstrate
these internal tensions, but the one that resonated with me was the depiction
of Fredericton.

	Leavitt's character tells us that Fredericton, as a city, was too small
and too confining for her; she had to get out to really find out who she was.
 And terrible things happen in Fredericton -- Leavitt is cautious about
displays of sexuality in the small, conservative city (and indeed, in one
harrowing scene, is taunted with calls of "dyke" by local boys who see her
holding her ailing mother's hand).  These moments are painful.  If one read
only the words in <em>Tangles</em>, the depiction of Fredericton is wholly
negative.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-on-2011
-08-01-at-23.04-2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-667"
title="Photo on 2011-08-01 at 23.04 #2"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-on-2011-
08-01-at-23.04-2.jpg" alt="" width="435" height="252" /></a>And yet with her
exquisitely simple style, Leavitt's drawings of Fredericton -- especially the
pedestrian bridge and Odell Park -- are disarmingly charming.  (Full
disclosure: Fredericton was my home for four years.  When I read
<em>Tangles</em> for the first time, the understated sketch of the pedestrian
bridge brought me to tears of homesickness.)  The city is not depicted as
exclusively negative; these lovely images nuance Leavitt's construction of
the town and demonstrate her own ambivalence.  While Leavitt's character
doesn't consider Fredericton her home, it's clear that she finds something
redeeming about the space; this acts as a metaphor for her conflicted
feelings about her family and her desire to be with them and with her partner
and her life in Vancouver at the same time.  Fredericton's ambivalent
construction in the text is very much a way to tell the story of Leavitt's
character's own ambivalence about the distance that separates her from her
family.

	In this text, Leavitt is also able to work out -- or at least examine --
some of her worst fears about her own likelihood of developing Alzheimer's.
 Leavitt constructs herself in the memoir as very much the image of the
ailing Midge; far more than her sister, Leavitt draws striking physically
resemblances throughout the text between herself and her mother through curly
hair, fine features, and even posture and body stamp.  Leavitt's character
repeatedly mentions her own terrible memory, contrasting it to her mother's
long-term memory that functions well into the progression of the disease.
 Leavitt's character works to strengthen her brain by writing with her
non-dominant hand and constantly challenging herself; she draws herself in
the image of her mother, but seeks to change the future for herself by
defying the potential disease state.  Here we see the tension between the
comforting connection to her mother's image (and repetition in behaviours,
such as receiving comfort from her mother as a child and now bestowing
comfort on her mother as an adult) and the fear of what that connection may
represent.

	<img class="aligncenter"
src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1049/5120004442_5e12364ce3_z.jpg" alt=""
width="640" height="294" />There is more to say about this memoir -- about
how Leavitt depicts the love between her parents, about the construction of
bodies through illness and the violations we endure, about death and mourning
among atheists and agnostics, about ritual, and about identity (who are we
when our memories are stripped away from us?) -- and I'll revisit
<em>Tangles</em> again here at Graphixia soon.  But in the meantime, read it
if you haven't.  It's painful and heart-wrenching, but also funny, touching,
warm, and passionately honest.  Leavitt's first foray into graphic memoir
really is a triumph.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Having just seen the
new Green Lantern film starring Ryan Reynolds and<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/GL1.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-full wp-image-688"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/GL1.jpg"
alt="Ryan Reynolds as Green Lantern" width="259" height="194" /></a> having
noted the plethora of negative reviews both for the storyline and directing,
I’m taking it upon myself to write a defense of the source material – no
better time to do it, really, as judging by the movie’s box office gross, it
doesn’t appear likely that there will be a sequel. The central concern that
most reviewers seem to have is that the movie is too outlandish, the
characters are too colourful, the world that the film creates is too
unrealistic to invite the mainstay viewer in to participate in the storyline.
Loosely translated, the main criticism is that the film comes off as too much
like a comic book. Given the success of other recent comic- based films, what
is it about Green Lantern that made it fail? It was generally quite faithful
to the source material, the acting (while not superb) carried the dialogue,
the special effects made the Green Lantern homeworld of Oa spectacular to
behold – it truly had all the makings of a successful film. Perhaps the
larger question here is, why are some comics easily translatable to winning
films while others are clearly not? We can be reminded here of Alan Moore’s
prophesy that his much lauded Watchmen was “unfilimable” and that he refused
to be involved in the rendering of his story into film, a prognostication
that, despite Zack Snyder’s fanatic adherence to the source material, turned
out to be quite correct (at least, again, in most critics’ eyes). Green
Lantern now has faced a similar problem, having transitioned into a medium
that it was never originally conceived for.

src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/GLAlan.jpg"
alt="Green Lantern Alan Scott" width="144" height="223" /></a>The history of
Green Lantern is incredibly rich and, unlike many of the modern characters
who are now enjoying silver screen fame (like Thor, Iron Man and Spider-man)
dates back to the Golden Age of comics. The original Green Lantern, Alan
Scott, who first appeared very shortly after Superman and Batman in
All-American Comics #16 in July of 1940, used a magic lantern fashioned out
of a meteorite to fight crime – his adventures were, like the other heroes of
the time, based on the dime-store detective fiction of the previous decade
with the twist of costumes and powers, and the crimes that he fought against
were entirely terrestrial in nature. The character received his own title and
moderate popularity, but he was ultimately unsuccessful and did not survive
into the Silver Age (though in the Modern Age he has since been rebooted and
is currently a member of the Justice Society of America).

	Hungry for new ideas to counter its relatively recent competitor Marvel
at<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/show221.jpg">
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-692"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/show221-
207x300.jpg" alt="Showcase 22" width="207" height="300" /></a> the start of
the Silver Age, DC decided to revamp Green Lantern in an entirely different
direction. Crafted by Gil Kane, Hal Jordan, making his first appearance in
Showcase #22 in October 1959, was the recipient of a ring from an alien named
Abin Sur (for those who have seen the film, the basic origin plot is
generally the same in this first issue). Oa and the development of the Green
Lantern Corps, however, are only hinted at in these first few appearances in
Showcase, with the character developing more slowly than what we see in
Spider-man and Superman, for example – the Guardians do not appear until the
character received his own series, despite having made contact with him in
Showcase #23, and the rest of the Corps only came into being as the
character’s solo title progressed.

	Much like in the Golden Age, the Silver Age Green Lantern was not a
popular character, and his title came very close to cancellation – it had
transitioned to a general science-fiction title, and its artists were
generally subpar compared to DC’s other then-current titles. This prompted
the editors of DC to hand the character over to Denny O’Neil and Neal Adams
in a last ditch attempt to save the title. Often considered the start of the
Bronze Age of comics, the duo’s run on the title (beginning with issue #76)
brought the <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/GL076.jpg"><
img class="size-medium wp-image-693 alignleft"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/GL076-201x300.
jpg" alt="Green Lantern 76" width="201" height="300" /></a>character back to
Earth and had Green Lantern wrestling with complex social issues for what is
arguably the first time in comics’ history to that point. Green Lantern,
paired with Green Arrow for the run, faced problems like racism, religious
fanaticism, the pervasiveness of media, the destructive nature of capitalism
and even Green Arrow’s sidekick, Speedy, wrestling with heroin addiction. The
contrast here to the Green Lantern invested in the politics of Oa and space
adventures is almost as great a contrast as Alan Scott was to Hal Jordan –
here, we are presented with a socially conscious character that is fully
grounded in the problems of his own world, ushering the comics’ reader into
thinking more diversely during their reading experience. Scholars have since
pointed to the run as being a sea-change in the way that comics were
conceived, acknowledging that for the first time the medium was acknowledged
as being able to carry explicitly complex, value laden original stories,
integrating complex moral struggles with elements of the fantastic.

	O’Neil and Adams’ run on Green Lantern was short, lasting only until
issue #89; the title went on hiatus directly after, and it did not see
publication again until 1977. From here, we once again encounter the outer
space exploits with the universe that Green Lantern operates in becoming
incredibly diverse and filled with a multitude of alien species, interstellar
wars and the complex workings of the Green Lantern Corps itself – beyond
this, for consistency and relevance to the publishing line as a whole, Hal
Jordan interacted with the mainstay characters of the DCU on a semi-regular
basis, being a member of the Justice League and appearing in others’ solo
titles as well. Green Lantern was eventually retitled Green Lantern Corps,
cancelled and rebooted again as Green Lantern #1 in 1989, a series which ran
for 181 issues. During this time, we have been introduced to many other Green
Lanterns, including Kyle Rayner, Guy Gardner and John Stewart, each of whom
many readers identify as their “favorite.” It has since been restarted by
Geoff Johns with Green Lantern: Rebirth and, because of the author’s highly
innovative reworking of Green Lantern history in regards to the emotional
colour spectrum of the power rings and the expansion of the Green Lantern
universe as a whole, the character is now one of DC’s “A-Listers,” sometimes
outselling long-standing titles like Action and Detective. The most recent DC
company-wide events have been based on the character, being Blackest Night
and the Sinestro Corps War, and the three current Green Lantern titles are
consistently in the ranks of DC’s top selling books.

	We’ve written before here about the fact that the comic world can often
be ostracizing to the outsider; this is ironic, as the titles and characters
often speak to the disenfranchised with the fantastic stories of power and
control over one’s environment, offering an out for the Sartrean suffering
that comes from negative events that occur outside of our personal spheres
(though this could really be the allure of fictional worlds in general). With
characters like Green Lantern, the reader is not addressing a platonic
archetype as he is in Superman, Batman and Spider-man; as my far from
comprehensive outlining of Green Lantern’s history shows, we have a character
who has seen many different incarnations over several decades of writers,
operating in as complex and nuanced a universe as comicdom offers. The appeal
of Green Lantern and the current success of his title stems from this
experienced evolution of his character and his environment, with readers
drawn into the highly detailed and closely read world of multiple authors’
imaginings – it is not so much the character himself who is successful (Hal
Jordan wasn’t even Earth’s Green Lantern for most of the 90’s) but the larger
scope of the rich mosaic of storyarcs that have led to his current
incarnation. One could argue that DC took a misstep in failing to recognize
this, that archetypal characters are always those that are most successful
because they can be related more easily to events off of the screen. Green
Lantern achieved prominence in the superhero genre while operating outside of
this dictum, taking many years to become popular and only when his personal
universe developed a consistency and depth that most other heroes are never
challenged by. While one could certainly argue (as I have myself) that all of
the characters who have lived through the Golden Age to present are
multiauthored constructions that are dynamic and shifting, demanding close
reading to develop a full understanding of their characters, none are so
dependent upon this type of reading as Green Lantern. This image below can
give you an idea of the expansiveness of the universe that has been created
in the many Green Lantern series over the decades:

	Film demands certain traits of its comic book franchises – there must be
a comprehensive origin story, a relatable character, a self contained plot
and a world that is fully explained through the lens of the reality in which
we normally operate (we can see this even in Marvel’s recent Thor, where the
Asgardian God was explained away as being a potential alien, his rainbow from
the heavens being an Einstein-Rosen bridge). In short, comic book movies are
expected to not be comic book movies; instead of acknowledging the complex
histories of the characters they address and incorporating a copious
dependence on suspension of reality, they anticipate no foreknowledge of the
character and attempt to offer condensed versions of characters for
single-serving consumption. Again, while this is acceptable for archetypes,
Green Lantern is not this kind of character. He is, instead, a very
“comic-book” character who relies on readers who have not only familiarized
themselves with the details of his universe but who have come to accept him,
over time, for all the conflicts his reality has with our own. Attempting to
condense this kind of history into a single package could not help but be
unsuccessful as, returning to Watchmen, Alan Moore knew about his own work.
In a similar way, Watchmen relied on the close reading of its audience in
relation to the superhero genre as a whole – his work was successful because
it mocked superhero archetypes by humanizing and thereby corrupting them,
requiring this familiarity in order to carry the breadth of its message.
Green Lantern, and the other characters like him (though they are few),
similarly demands a perspective that is familiar with the way that comics
operate as a running saga that is complex and varied, that is not immediately
consumable and dispensed with. When the movie attempts to collapse this
history and turn the richness of the Green Lantern Universe into a single two
hour film, it does a disservice to what made Green Lantern an asset to the
DCU in the first place. The reviews that state that the movie is too much
like a comic book are indeed accurate and are telling in that they highlight
the fact that certain titles in the medium do have an essential element that
make them successful here and nowhere else. The stories and histories of
Green Lantern are worth reading because of their complexity, and perhaps the
relative failure of the film that unsuccessfully attempted to condense this
dynamic and continuously evolving space only serves to emphasize the positive
qualities of the character in his original home.]]></content:encoded>

Pornography and Comics</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[We've discussed the
relationship between comics and mimesis, temporality, identity, continuity,
and a whole slew of other categories. In fact, the basis for our continuing
engagement with comic books is an underlying, preconceived, agreement that
comics deserve critical scrutiny that reflects the complicated subjects and
themes comics themselves engage with. That said, our criticism of comics
relies--like all forms of criticism--on analytical frameworks borrowed from
other methodologies--literary criticism, film criticism, and other modes such
as social critique and philosophical interrogations (post-structuralism!).
And while this approach to the criticism of comics is all well, and good, it
belies its own undercurrent of elitism, exclusion, and preconception. In
other words, we take the critique of comics seriously only for those comics
that take themselves seriously or, those comics that imply they take
themselves and their subject seriously as a medium for expression. There's
always room for a joke, irony, and liminality without plunging the whole
exercise into the toilet as "inauthentic" or "inane," but we tend to critique
on the basis of a set of--with apologies to Woody Allen--aesthetic criteria
that prioritize "serious" subjects, re-imaginings, or themes.  Our reluctance
to move out of the "serious artist / critic" mode, suggests there are areas
where comics are "representing" that need critical attention, if only to
account for the dearth of socio-cultural subjects comics represent in the
twenty first century. And one of those subjects in need of attention is the
relationship between comics and pornography.

	<!--more-->

	Pornography in comic books occupies an odd "middest" position (credit to
<a
href="http://www.amazon.ca/Sense-Ending-Studies-Fiction-Epilogue/dp/
0195136128">Frank Kermode</a>) somewhere between credibly realistic--it does
"show" anatomical features in a way literary pornography cannot--and
comically awkward--it doesn't "show" anatomical features in way that film or
video can. Like every other kind of comic book representation, pornographic
comics represent a hybrid between realism and fiction that is both
self-evident and cloaked in a web of integrative connections between text,
context, and image.

	If we take for granted that Umberto Eco is correct and comics are
“inconsumable” in that they cannot occupy a fixed place in time but rather
occupy a constantly recurring present in which the circumstances change only
tangentially, then the connection between superhero comics and pornography is
almost a formality. Just like a viewer of pornography, the comic book reader
can predict how the narrative will develop, its signature moments, key
manoeuvres, all leading to the proverbial “money shot” in which all anxieties
are released and the action hero retreats back into daily life. As we’ve
discussed in the posts of Graphixia before, even the narratives of
non-superhero comics follow a particular trajectory around <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2011/01/08/i-dont-want-you-should-
mention-image-text-and-the-authenticity-of-memoir/">memory</a>, <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2011/07/04/30-who-wears-the-tights-in-
this-relationship-selfhood-and-identity-in-grant-morrisons-batman-and-robin/"
>identity</a>, and awakenings that reflect the inconsumable dimensions of the
<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2011/07/19/32-boobs-and-babes-or-why-
comics-suck/">superhero comic</a>. It’s not so much that comics are like
pornography; it’s that they enact the same narrative techniques and rely on
fulfilling a similar set of expectations in the reader. Everyone knows what
they’re getting and everyone's secretly--or openly--happy about that fact.

	Of course, inevitable will be the pointing to artists such as Robert
Crumb, who seem to embrace rather than resist the pornographic pretense to
comic books. However, Crumb participates in the long line of comic book
illustrators who reconfigure superhero tropes in other contexts. There’s no
question that Crumb’s artwork is closer to being labelled pornographic at
face value than the textual analysis needed to deconstruct pornographic
layers in a<em> Spider-Man</em> comic. However, Crumb’s story-lines always
enact the superhero fantasy of coming out of one’s shell and performing
super-heroic acts. Indeed, Crumb’s work is a helpful bridge between the
super-heroic of fantasy and the super-heroic of, well, fantasy. Superman
might be restricted to fighting crime, but Crumb’s crude supermen perform
sexually in a superhuman way. Pornography is full of super-humanity, real and
fake. It’s also full of costume and shifting identities. In fact, pornography
and comics are ridiculously alike. They both enact a fantasy of everyday life
that allows for escape, mimesis, memory. Everyone is just "minding their own
business” until something happens and one is given an opportunity to do, and
be, otherwise. We always fast-forward through the constant re-telling of
origin stories, but we need them to be there; it's part of the experience of
recognition (cue lame synth music: bowm. bowm. chicka-bown. preeeummm. bowm).

	There’s a lot of comics—long and short form—out there that are strictly
pornography. It’s not all about memoir, history, superheroes; or maybe it is.
See, that’s the thing. Comics, no matter what they represent, play for the
same comfort zones as pornography, and they always have. The first
"re-writes" of comics characters were in the infamous "Tijuana Bibles" that
took famous characters from newspaper strips and put them into pornographic
story-lines: Blondie unapologetically <a
href="http://tijuanabibles.org/bibles/TB077/">riding Dagwood</a> moaning
about his over-sized cock, or Dick Tracey showing his engorged first name to
a nude, wide-eyed, dilated-pupil <a
href="http://tijuanabibles.org/bibles/TB080/">Little Orphan Annie</a>. Long
before Moore and Miller, artists were reframing superheroes and others in
updated and “more realistic” contexts, and they were doing it
pornographically--maybe the “unliterary” is influence.]]></content:encoded>

	&nbsp;

	Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips' <em>Criminal: The Last of the Innocent
</em>#1 transforms the crime comic book into a metafictional (metacomical?)
reflection on how comics create meaning. Brubaker and Phillips perform this
transformation by incorporating two distinct comics styles, gritty crime
comic and “Archie” pastiche, to reflect on temporality, memory, and,
ultimately, death. Comics, they suggest, are about our relationship to death
and our efforts to repress it as the telos of our everyday existence. They
exploit the structure of comics as a sequence of panels each of which
“freezes” a moment of action or contemplation.

	<!--more-->

	This is not the first time that Brubaker and Philips have interposed a
radically different comics style in their narratives.  In the first series of
<em>Criminal</em>, Brubaker and Phillips embedded a newspaper detective comic
strip, "Frank Kafka, Private Eye" as an absurdist counterpoint to the gritty
main story. That newspaper strip interrupts the conventions of the genre,
suggesting that what we take as "realism" in the main story is really just a
style or mode, just like "Dick Tracy," say. We are reminded of Roland
Barthes’ “reality effect” from <em>The Pleasure of the Text.</em> The message
is that comics create, rather than represent, a world. And because that world
is a sequence of static images, slipping images from other styles or modes
into the mix is relatively simple.

	Usually, a comic maintains a "look" that the artist does not deviate from
so that there is continuity from frame to frame. Some comics artists,
however, like Jessica Alba, in <em>La Perdida</em>, or Jason Lutes, in
<em>Berlin</em>, will change the facial structure of their characters
occasionally from frame to frame so that they are more like a “realistic”
drawing than a “caricatured” cartoon. Allison Bechdel, in <em>Fun Home,</em>
draws characters in photographs so that they contrast with her typical
representation of them.  But none of these shifts is as radical those in
<em>The</em> <em>Last of the Innocent</em>.

	Like many comics, <em>The Last of the Innocent</em> is structured around
binarisms: present and past; city and country; crime comic and “Archie”
comic. The first terms in these pairs appear in Phillips' typical style:
black lined panels, lots of charcoal pencil effects and chiaroscuro.  The
second terms, however, appear in clean, flat, four-colour mode with nary a
shadow to be seen, just like an Archie comic, with the small town of
"Brookview" standing in for "Riverdale." Our reading experience is one of
radical alterity. In fact, the first time the style switched, I thought
panels from a different comic book had been spliced into my copy.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/CRIM_TEASER1-
crop.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-720"
title="CRIM_TEASER1-crop"

crop-291x300.jpg" alt="" width="291" height="300" /></a>

	In <em>Last of the Innocent</em>, the idyllic past of the small town
bleeds into the "criminal" present of the city, so that the conventions of
Archie-world give way to those of the crime comic.  The allusiveness of the
Brookview panels is not difficult to figure out.  "Freakout" is "Jughead" and
there's a soda shop. The back story for Riley Richards includes  a Betty and
Veronica struggle over his affections between Felicity and Lizzie. Riley
moves to the city and marries the rich girl "Felix," while Lizzie and
Freakout remain in Brookview. But the point of the narrative is not simply to
spot the connections. Rather, the idea is that the stable, unchanging world
of the Archie comic be submitted to time and death. Felicity cheats on Riley
with the Reggie Mantle character and Riley decides to  to kill her.  The
effect is exactly what Freud called "the Unheimlich" or "the uncanny;"
something all too familiar is recast as unfamiliar and frightening.

	The Archie comic represents a world untouched by time, a "Grecian Urn"
type of space in which Archie is caught in a love triangle of infinite
variations but without resolution or development [1].  The crime story, on
the other hand, deals with the transitory and fragile nature of life. The
genre is all about the death that is missing from the Archie comic, presented
as a sublime thrill. It is difficult to imagine the readerships of the two
types of comic overlapping because they represent such opposite visions of
the world. The crime comic is one realm of the comics world where continuity
does not play much of a role because the characters tend to die; and unlike
superheroes they tend not to come back to life.

	Submitting the world of Archie to that of the crime comic so that
“Archie” plots the death of “Veronica” ironizes the little world of
Riverdale/Brookview where she has always been trapped in a kind of living
death. Innocence, of the type that Archie comics represent, is the same
double phenomenon that appears in Keats' poem: the price of eternal youth is
to be frozen in time, or, say, stuck in a comic book. The uncanny moment of
<em>The Last of the Innocent</em> comes when we understand the relationship
between the two kinds of comics world deaths: the murder of the crime comic
that violates the quotidian cycle of existence and its expectations and the
"living death" of a world where nothing changes in a meaningful way.

	What these deaths repress is death like that which comes from Riley's
father's stomach cancer, a death that is neither exciting nor preventable.
Most of us will not murder or be murdered, and none of us will live forever
in Riverdale/Brookview. The real familiarity that the Archie comic and the
ordinary crime comic seek to repress is the inevitable and probably quite
boring death that most of us will face in spite of our efforts to forestall
it. The final lines of Keat's ode: 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is
all/Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.'  thinly veil the real capping
statement of "Ode on a Grecian Urn" and <em>Criminal: The Last of the
Innocent</em>: We are all going to die. The unmoving picture of the comic
book, Archie or otherwise, testifies to this inevitability as much as it
might try to repress it. Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips take the brave step of
exposing this unfortunate truth.

	[1] <em>Life with Archie</em> introduced transformation to Riverdale with
Archie marrying Veronica. <em>Last of the Innocent</em> includes a "Life with
Riley" segment as an allusion.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>This post was
delayed on account of cat injury / illness.  It was almost a detailed
play-by-play of administering anti-inflammatories to an angry cat, but that
post will eventually be a graphic narrative all its own: Tales of a Broken
Tail.  But cats -- the internet's favourite animal -- give a prime segue into
the internet's other favourite thing: Scott Pilgrim.</em>

	<em>Yes, that's right -- a blog post, on the internet, about Scott
Pilgrim.  And it's not even 2009!  Amazing.</em>

	When I first moved to Vancouver, I had an experience at a comic book shop
that chilled me to the core.  I asked the head nerd if he could recommend me
some Canadian titles to check out -- slice of life or otherwise, I wasn't
picky; just looking for some new CanCon because I like graphic narratives and
I teach Canadian literature and I like to teach graphic narratives in my
Canadian literature classes.<!--more--> <blockquote>Me: What can you
recommend in terms of recent Canadian graphic narratives?

	Head Nerd: There aren't any.

	Me: *stunned silence*

	Head Nerd: Yeah, Canadians just don't write graphic stuff.

	Me: *quiet aneurysm*

	Head Nerd: I guess maybe Scott Pilgrim.  But that barely counts.  Bryan
Lee O'Malley doesn't even live in Canada anymore.</blockquote> When I
regained consciousness, I set about finding a different comic shop to
frequent.  But it foregrounded a couple of issues for me: <ol> <li>Are
Canadian comic readers unaware of Canadian cultural output in this
realm?</li> <li>What makes something Canadian?</li> </ol> I won't try to
cover #2, since a PhD in CanLit and countless essays from students has not
yet illuminated this for me.  I'll touch on some aspects, though.  #1,
however, makes me wonder.  I was pleased when <em>Essex County</em> was
selected for Canada Reads last year, because I think Canada Reads usually
does a good job of demonstrating what middlebrow literature consumers are in
to, and it was nice to see graphic narrative represented there for the first
time (even if the debates around it were troubling).  But what is the
awareness of Canadian graphic novels and narratives generally?  Will a Sarah
Leavitt ever have the cultural cache of a Miriam Toewes?  Does it matter?  Do
people know that <em>Kill Shakespeare</em> is Canadian when they pick it up?
 Do they care?

	Because CanLit is my thing, I try to use my non-themed posts here at
Graphixia to talk about Canadian titles -- it hasn't been conscious, really,
up to now, but it will be from here on out.  And I'm going to start with the
first of a series of posts about Scott Pilgrim, because I think in
interesting ways Bryan Lee O'Malley is actually very interested in carving
out a specifically Canadian space in the world of graphic narratives.  And
also because the series is freaking awesome -- which the internet could
already tell you, of course.

	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_KpuWiIO4">bread makes you
fat?!</a>

	Volume One of the Scott Pilgrim saga, <em>Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little
Life</em> sets up the basic premise of the series: Scott Pilgrim is a slacker
who plays in a crappy band and mooches off his best friend and dates high
school girls and just generally kind of herp derps his way through life.
 Until he meets Ramona Flowers, who magic-pixie-dream-girls his heart.  But
she's going to make him work for it -- she has seven evil exes, and to be her
boyfriend, Scott Pilgrim will have to defeat them all.

	If you saw the movie trailer, you know the plot.

	But the graphic novel also sets up a very specifically Canadian space for
the narrative to unfold.  This is not a Canadian city posing as Anycity, USA
-- this is Toronto, complete with accurate street and place references
(Tourism Toronto even wants you to <a
href="http://www.seetorontonow.com/scottpilgrim/index.asp">take the Scott
Pilgrim tour of the city</a>).  In a class on the text, I had students
catalogue all the minute Canadian details -- from use of "eh" to images of
Canadian currency to brands like Molson and Labatts -- and respond to it.
 Many students liked that something so full of Canadian in-jokes and
reference points was so popular outside of Canada; that indeed Bryan Lee
O'Malley's international success suggested a legitimacy for these cultural
reference points that they particularly appreciated.

	(The eternal need for such legitimacy is Canadian in and of itself, of
course.)

	<a
href="http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2010.07-film-saneman/">Critics
have argued that Scott Pilgrim's underdog-done-good narrative is a
particularly Canadian rendition of the superhero saga</a>, and I like that
reading but I'm not sure it holds up -- the formula of slacker-turned-hero is
not a Canadian invention nor particularly special Canadian terrain.  But that
it is read this way is important to an understanding of how Canadians
perceive ourselves, and why we like these moments of "American noticed us!"

	I think the more important contribution of a text like <em>Scott
Pilgrim's Precious Little Life</em> -- particularly given its international
success and popularity -- is that it uses Canadian space-and-place as
significantly interesting haunts for superhero stories.  It does so with
great self-awareness (the frame-by-frame packing in of Canadian reference
points suggests this) and a sense of purpose.  O'Malley is telling an
entertaining story first and foremost, but his desire to locate and frame it
within a Canadian (and specifically Torontonian) series of cultural reference
points is important to developing and nurturing a larger conversation about
Canadian graphic narratives more generally.

	Next month, I'll talk more about the story itself, with a particular eye
to the way gender is represented in the Scott Pilgrim
saga.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

<title>#40 Dying All the Time: Daytripper</title>
<link>http://www.graphixia.ca/2011/09/769/</link> <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2011

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Daytripper</em> by
Brazilian twin brothers Fábio Moon and Gabriel Bá does a number of things
that should doom a comic to failure. First of all it’s gimmicky: at the end
of each issue the main character, Bras de Oliva Domingos, dies. Furthermore,
when we first meet him in issue #1, he’s an obituary writer. So he’s a guy
who writes about other people’s deaths and then dies himself. Second,
<em>Daytripper</em> is as sentimental as all get out. Bras’ deaths terminate
stories about relationships with women, his father, his best friend, his
mother, and so on. Each of his deaths has a distinct emotional impact hooked
to the specific relationship he has with different characters.

	<!--more--><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/09-Daytripper
.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-770" title="09-Daytripper"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/09-Daytripper.
jpg" alt="" width="600" height="427" /></a>

	The sentimentality of <em>Daytripper</em> is part of its charm, however,
and the art reinforces it. Bras has a sweet, hang dog kind of look. He is
kind and thoughtful. There is nothing anti-hero about him. He loves his dog,
his wife, and his child. He has a good friendship with a co-worker at the
paper.

	&nbsp;

	Offsetting obvious ironies and sentimentality is the way that the deaths
are not in chronological sequence; the issues  jump around. Readers are thus
invited to find patterns other than chronology to interpret the sequence,
like relationship vectors, for instance. One pattern is that characters tend
to appear in the issue previous to the one in which they play a key role in
some aspect of Bras’ life. We ask, what would it mean if he died now? or now?
or now? And when he appears again in the next issue, perhaps older, perhaps
younger, we get a sense of cheating death and cheating at the rules of
narrative trajectory. If the horizon of death lures us through stories as the
ultimate telos, <em>Daytripper</em> screws with that notion, presenting
trajectories that would look like an airline’s map of destinations.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Daytripper-4-
cover.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-771"
title="Daytripper 4 cover"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Daytripper-4-
cover-194x300.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="300" /></a>

	Of course, writing obituaries is not what Bras aspires to; he would
rather be a successful writer like his father. Perhaps the only negative
emotion Bras shows is a kind of resentment towards his father’s fame. In the
first issue, Bras’ dissatisfaction with being an obituary writer is set
against a state celebration of his father’s accomplishments. Eventually he
achieves success as a writer, writing a rather hideously titled novel called
<em>Silken Eyes</em>. But “success” comes to mean many things: being a good
son, father, husband, friend.

	&nbsp;

	Those who read the whole series will find that the anticipation of Bras’
death in each issue becomes something of a joke: “I wonder how he’s gonna get
it this time." Issue #3 even jokes about its own narrative strategy. Bras’
friend Jorge mimics the closing of each issue when he says that Bras has died
of a broken heart: “Thing is...nobody told Bras he was dead, so he showed up
for work anyway." This gimmick does achieve its aim of making us contemplate
the fragility of life through giving Bras multiple deaths, as if he were a
cat. What if Bras were to “really” die in issue #1 in which his father gets a
state tribute for his contribution to Brazilian Letters, and Bras is a mere
newspaper obituary writer? What if he were to die as a child during a family
visit to his grandparents’ farm? In each case, the telos of the story makes
us reconstruct the life that leads up to it.

	&nbsp;

	If <em>Criminal: The Last of the Innocent</em> is about the relationship
between murder and innocence, <em>Daytripper</em> is about how death frames
our everyday existence. It could happen now, now, now. So each moment moment
of pleasure or insight is somehow stolen from death. As Bras’ father says,
“Life is made of such moments, son. Relationships are based on such moments,
such choices, such actions...” The final moment of death is the end point of
many moments of pleasure and insight, of life. For each of us, Bras’ father
says, one moment of life stands above all the rest. And this moment is the
moment of death’s counterpart.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/
tumblr_lhdoi9bROg1qb5j1co1_500_thumb1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full

tumblr_lhdoi9bROg1qb5j1co1_500_thumb1.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="200"
/></a>

	For example, when Bras meets his wife to be in a grocery store/ coffee
shop, the moment is as accidental as the moments throughout the series that
cause his death. In that issue, Bras dies when he is struck by a delivery
truck as he runs back to tell the woman about his feelings. But the story
cheats death when he shows up married to her in the next issue. As
superheroes show us time and again, comics is a medium whose characters die
and come back to life over and over again. <em>Daytripper</em> turns that
gesture into a reflection on what life means.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[In this second post
about Scott Pilgrim (you can read the first one <a title="#38 Scott Pilgrim
World 1, Level 1 (Book 1): Canadian, eh?"
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2011/08/30/38-scott-pilgrim-world-1-
level-1-book-1-canadian-eh/">here</a>), I'm going to focus on Ramona and her
role in the series as a perfect example of a Manic Pixie Dream Girl (though
Bryan Lee O'Malley plays with this convention to a certain extent).

	A Manic Pixie Dream Girl (MPDG), if you're not familiar with the term, is
a common stock character particularly popular in the boy-centric genres of
graphic narratives, hipster indie films, and video games.  The term was
coined by Nathan Rabin <a
href="http://origin.avclub.com/articles/the-bataan-death-march-of-whimsy-case
-file-1-eliza,15577/">in a review of the film <em>Elizabethtown </em>written
for the Onion AV Club in 2007</a>.  (The same publication later put together
a list of MPDGs, <a
href="http://http://www.avclub.com/articles/wild-things-16-films-featuring-
manic-pixie-dream-g,2407/">available here</a>.)  MPDGs exist as static
characters -- quirky and adorable, eccentric and girly, they are
<em>different</em> from other girls in the life of our male protagonist, and
they exist solely to <em>teach him about life </em>and <em>change how he
thinks about the world</em>.  These are <em>profound, transformative
</em>figures.  They just, you know, don't get to have motivations, goals, or
intentions of their own.  Because they're too busy being <em>profoundly
eccentric and adorable</em>.  Think Natalie Portman in <em>Garden State</em>;
the character only functions to redefine Zach Braff's sad slacker life.

	Indeed, the important counterpoint to the MPDG is the man-child
protagonist; a protagonist who is content in life and functional in society
is not ripe for transformation and thus not primed for the MPDG experience.
 The MPDG will move on to another sad, aimless slacker (chicks dig those,
right?) and there will be no sleeper indie hit.

	And here, Scott Pilgrim is our man-child.  And Ramona Flowers is our
Manic Pixie Dream Girl.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ramona-
flowers-scott-pilgrim-comic.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full
wp-image-780" title="ramona-flowers-scott-pilgrim-comic"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ramona-flowers
-scott-pilgrim-comic.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="168" /></a>

	<!--more-->The problem with the MPDG, of course, is that she isn't an
agent in her own life.  She exists solely to make a better man of the
protagonist; through her whimsy and beauty, she helps him find his focus and
set goals for his life.  She's can't afford to be multidimensional because
her task is singular.  So all MPDGs end up being the same.

	In the Scott Pilgrim series, though, much of the archetypal issues around
MPDG characters are right on the surface.  Ramona puts the "dream" in MPDG by
having intercessory powers -- she is a connection between Scott's sleeping
and waking world, interacting with his dream state.  She enacts the "magic"
and "pixie" aspects through kicking off this supernatural, otherworldly
battle-of-the-exes chaos that frames the series.  She's quirky -- she listens
to little-known bands, has an outsider (really American) perspective on
Scott's world, and she engages with the universe on roller skates and while
wearing goggles.  She's sweetly unique.

	And she does motivate change in Scott, though Scott is so non-functional
that it seems impossible that she wouldn't.  She motivates his central quest
-- the slaying of the evil exes -- but she also inspires him to write
(terrible) music.  Because he's Scott, he isn't immediately motivated to
change his living or employment situations, but he is motivated to lie to her
about these changes.  And crucially, she lacks the agency of a more
fully-developed female character, which is part of what makes her so clearly
a MPDG foil to Scott.  She is never present at the battles of the exes, never
fighting for her own freedom from this cycle but instead content to allow
Scott to intercede.  This is because ultimately, though the battles with the
exes are framed around winning Ramona's love (interesting given that for much
of the story Ramona's interest in Scott seems to be benevolent mild
attraction rather than love), the quest is really a metaphor for Scott's own
insecurities.  Through battling the exes, he is not winning Ramona's love but
freeing himself from a life of passive disinterest -- and ultimately
triumphing over the heartbreak surrounding Envy Adams.

	Scott's intense loser-i-ness really suggests to me, however, that
O'Malley is at least aware of the stock characters he has tapped in to and is
playing with them a little.  For example, the "music" Scott is inspired to
write by Ramona is comically bad:

	[youtube_video id="lmQmM2wva5Q"]

	The suggestion seems to be here that even the manickiest, most pixieful
dream girl cannot fix the brilliant mess that is Scott Pilgrim overnight.

	Next time: masculinity and the role of fighting in the Scott Pilgrim
universe.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the standard
complaints about the superhero genre of comic books is that the female form
is grossly exaggerated, highly sexualized and, most often, presented as
scantily clad as possible. The concern, typically, is that these characters
are often two dimensional and set a standard of unrealistic expectations for
the predominantly male readership, and they have the added effect of
ostracizing female readers who are disturbed by the common trope of the
oversized breasts, undersized waists and jutting hips t<a

src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/superman1.jpg"
alt="" width="259" height="194" /></a>hat are the norm for women in comics.
What often goes unaddressed, however, is that this hyper-sexuality and
exaggeration of form is just as prevalent (if not moreso) for the male heroes
and their sidekicks in comics as well. The male form, presented with swollen
pectorals, washboard abs and tree-trunk quads, is arguably just as
unattainable an ideal, yet the presentation receives little to no complaint,
nor is it commonly branded as purely homoerotic despite comics’ predominantly
male readership. Why is this the case?

	<!--more-->

	Comics have a long history of presenting characters in a highly
sexualized way, from the earliest images of thick-eyelashed, wide-hipped Mary
Jane Watson / Parker to the chiseled jaw and powerful form of Bruce Wayne,
and over the seventy-plus years of mass-market superhero comics, little has
changed in these representations. The idealistic bodies we are offered in
comics, both male and female, are now an expectation for readers, and not
seeing this physical shape on our heroes and their counterparts would now be
a shock in the medium. There have certainly been exceptions to this rule,
however, but they have come not from the superhero genre but more heady,
academic fare such as Dave Sim’s “Cerebus,” Terry Moore’s “Strangers in
Paradise” and the various imprints of the “Big Two” – Marvel and DC – that
have been branded as being marketed towards mature readers because of more
advanced thematic content. The fact remains that superhero comics are sexist,
both from a feminist as well as a masculinist standpoint. Or are they?
Perhaps, given the decibel level of the complaints from gender theorists
towards the exaggerated female form in comics, we have yet to acknowledge
that there may be more to the derogatory labels than is readily noticed at
first glance.

	Firstly, and even more basely than arguing that comics are essentially
soft-core pornography, the hyper-sexualized form is easier for an artist to
draw. Anyone who has taken first-year anatomy first learns the muscle
structures underneath however many layers of girth we add onto it, and this
is presented as the simple ideal – readily available and standardized, easy
to sketch out almost blindly to the tune of twenty-two pages a month. Spandex
allows the artist to dispense with the folds and lines of clothes and the
individualized nuances of parcels of scattered fat, as he recalls the base
model which he is drawing; the expectation for the superhero artist is
predictability of the familiar physical body and, more importantly, a speedy
delivery of his or her work. The logistics are clean and simple: deliver what
you’ve been taught, and make sure it’s on time. One can see the application
of this in even the earliest Superman and Spider-man comics – there is no
need, given these heroes’ powers, for th<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/supebat1.jpg"
><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-798"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/supebat1.jpg"
alt="" width="261" height="193" /></a>em to be bulky and sexualized.
Superman’s powers are fueled by the sun, not by his musculature, and
Spider-man by his radioactive blood, not by his lean frame. The fact remains
that these male characters, and all others like them, are presented with
exaggerated physical forms and a body fat content in the very low single
digits.

	This first point, however, is too easy an out – many comics’ artists,
such as Frank Quitely and John Cassaday, attempt to break this mold on a
regular basis, giving us heroes who are more “realistic” in their
representation of the human form, as they spend vast amounts of time –
resulting in frequent delays of books – in order to present their craft as
something other than simple mimicry. More important than the simple logistics
of the industry and the turnaround time for the artist trying to fill pages
is the fact that these are our heroes, bastions of virtue and standards for
moral good.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/hulk12.jpg"><
img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-801"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/hulk12.jpg"
alt="" width="196" height="257" /></a>The superhero genre is populated
predominantly by characters who understand the world in terms of black and
white, of a simple good versus evil binary that requires a standardized
justice to be dispensed to maintain. We look to them, both as children and as
adults, with expectation on how to act when faced with difficult or morally
challenging encounters – it must be remembered that comics were, at first, a
pedagogical tool in order to distribute the classics in a more accessible
way. It is hardly surprising then that these heroes, who are paradigms of
virtue and who are often very unrealistic in terms of their morally
definitive nature are also paradigms of the physical form. These heroes, male
and female, make moral choices that most of us are incapable of making, from
patrolling the streets to ensure that justice is being meted out against
those who would do society wrong, to sacrificing the completeness of the
individual private life for a greater sense of the common good. We turn to
these heroes at an early age for pedagogical examples on the platonic form of
how to behave, of the essential nature of moral certitude; this applies not
only to the male characters of Superman and Batman, but to the proud and
equally powerful female characters of Wonder Woman and Power Girl. Why then
would the content not be expressed outwardly in their forms? These heroes are
our ideals in a moral sense, as we aspire to have the courage to make the
same choices they do when in their monthly difficult circumstances – their
bodies are, predictably, also presented as ideals, just as platonic and
unattainable as their ability to choose good over evil at every turn. The
ripped chests and swelled breasts of our heroes are not meant to ostracize or
alienate, but to show us that these characters are meant to be aspired to.
Their outward appearance, both for males and females, is only as exaggerated
as the binaristic perspectives they hold on right and wrong.

	The stories presented in the superhero genre of comic books are
fantastic, meant to entertain and draw us in to an idealized representation
of the world in which evil is readily identifiable as such, and good is
always present to be able to confront it head on. The stories themselves are
exaggerations of expectation, are emphasized versions of the encounters we
face in our lives that remind us of the importance of our choices. The
exaggerated bodies of our heroes, present even when dialogue is not, reflect
the idyllic nature of their characters and remind us that, however
unattainable, we should be pursuing these ideals in our every action. The
hyper-sexualized male form and its female counterpart, then, are images of
what society at large (reflected in the artists’ renderings) suggests that we
should aspire to even if these ideals are impossible to achieve.

	It is a testament to our age, for good or for ill, that we find
idealistic representations contemptible – one does not see these offenses
taken in Greek sculpture or renaissance painting. Instead of platonic
representations through which we can aspire, we are distracted (and perhaps
limited) by ambiguity and synthesis. In recognizing the medium of the comic
book and the superhero genre, one might apply the same logic here that
Aristotle prescribes to art more generally: “The aim of art is to represent
not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance, and
this, and not the external manner and detail, is true
reality.”]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[In our discussions
about comics, we've tended to orbit around superheroes, post-war graphic
"novels," and the way these comic books are reflected and received in popular
culture. So let's call this post a "serious turn." What hasn't been covered
up to now, and it's a big oversight, is the woodcut novel. The woodcut novel,
a kin of William Blake's illuminating printing, etching on copper plates, in
this instance refers to a "wordless" novel made up of a sequence of images
produced by etching onto plates of wood (or linoleum, metal, rubber, etc.) in
relief (like, backwards).

	<a

	<!--more-->These "wordless" graphic novels--and they truly are "graphic"
novels, made up of long, complex narratives that rely solely on the image
sequence to covey the plot of the story--tend to build on religious or epic
narratives. Their stories are about rises and downfalls, the perils of sin,
but also of social justice, anxieties about technology, mechanization,
dehumanization, and mass production. In fact, they tend to deal with these
subjects in a less latent way than comic books do now. The woodcuts require a
deep engagement with the image and thus do not need to rely on the
interpretations of Captain America's runaway capitalism, or Fantastic Four's
technological dehumanization, or Spiderman's atomic anxieties. Instead, the
reader must work to create her own words from the etchings on the page,
creating a story that is at once the author's, but as much the reader's, for
she is deeply invested in the politics of its making.

	<a

210x300.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="300" /></a>

	One of the best known artists in the medium (or genre as long as we're
talking comic books) is Lynd Ward (if your into it: The Library of America
just published a handsome two volume set of his most popular woodcut novels).
The picture above is fairly representative of his work and hints at the
prevalence of the detailed lines, and careful crafting that went into it.
While he cannot be credited with inventing the format--that honour probably
goes to<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_Masereel"> Frans
Mesereel</a>, but I'm just spitballing--he can certainly be credited as its
most popular purveyor. The list of comic book artists indebted to Ward's
woodcuts (and the etchings of others, such as Masereel and<a
href="http://www.glenbow.org/collections/art/research/hyde.cfm"> Laurence
Hyde</a>) is long: Art Spiegelman, Will Eisner, George Herriman, Marjane
Starapi, Jason Lutes, Joe Sacco, Seth, all have a style that reflects the
lines, scratches, and scrapes of woodcut artists. Once you've feasted on a
few woodcut novels, it's hard to read any black and white comic book out
there without recalling the work of early woodcut artists such as Ward and
Masereel.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/maus.jpg"><
img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-826" title="maus"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/maus-300x223.
jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" /></a>

	In his introduction to Ward's collected works, Art Spiegelman notes, as
he walks through a gallery show of Ward's work, "I remember slowing down to
notice that a number of the prints on display depicted trees and forests. I
thought about the poetry of patiently carving into a dead tree to make a
print on paper that commemorated the once living thing" (xxv). That's a
perceptive comment from Spiegelman, as usual.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/
ward_buildings.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-818"
title="ward_buildings"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ward_buildings
-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" /></a>

	Given that woodcut novels tend toward stories about depression-era
anxieties about labour, social justice, runaway consumption, and the
dehumanizing effect of the corporate industrial complex, the process of their
creation is worth careful consideration. First of all, it's a different
process than anything we normally associate with modern comic book
production. No sketchbooks, or inkers, or colourists, only an artist using a
graver (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burin">burin</a>)
painstakingly (and I imagine there were several painful moments when the
burin slipped, gashing a finger or two) carving lines in a block of wood or
linoleum. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ward_woodcut.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-823" title="ward_woodcut"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ward_woodcut.
jpg" alt="" width="266" height="383" /></a></p> The move to produce woodcuts
looks like a calculated response to the anxieties mentioned above. It seems
to offer a <em>riposte</em> to modes of mass production, and the loss of a
tactile connection to the goods we produce. It's certainly a different
perspective on mass production, one that in itself gave rise to the modern,
disposable, drugstore comic book. The etched block can be placed directly in
the printing press, or inked up, and rolled out onto pages, then stitched to
together by hand. It's quite literally "hand-crafted" and always so, even if
it is then mass-produced on the printing press.

	<a

"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-821" title="EPSON scanner

src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ward_face-
221x300.jpg" alt="" width="221" height="300" /></a>

	One of the most interesting things about woodcut images for me, is the
dominance of black. It's the first thing that strikes me when I encounter a
woodcut--the black. Quite simply, because of the effort that must be made to
produce whitespace in relief etching (the white space is the carved out part
of the block because it does not hold the ink), blacks tend to dominate the
images. This feature is even more evident when the reader returns to images
created with the pen or pencil. The whitespace leaps out and seems deserted
and overly bright in contrast with the deep, dark, overwhelming blacks of
woodcuts.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/
gross_donewrong.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-817"
title="gross_donewrong"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/
gross_donewrong.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="259" /></a>

	The image above is from Milt Gross'<em> He Done Her Wrong</em> (subtitled
"The Great American Novel (with no words)). Itself a "wordless novel," and a
funny, well-rendered one at that, the whitespace frees things up and in fact
makes it funny. There's rarely anything funny about the woodcut novel
(especially in the Ward, Giacomo Patri, Masereel tradition) because the
blacks overwhelm the page and make it claustrophobic, dark, depressing. All
this to say that the comic genre yields so much of its interpretive power to
the image itself, the way it is constructed, it's use of shadow and line,
that the mode of its production (burin or pen) is essential and reflected in
its reception. As George A. Walker tells us the woodcut "is often referred to
as the art of the white line because it is a subtractive process that works
from black to white. To make a black line the artist must carve two white
lines, since the wood must be removed from both sides of the line that is to
print" (15). Whereas, with the pen, the process is additive, with the pen
filling the whitespace with lines. The juxtaposition of these two styles of
graphic storytelling is a rich source for interpretation and inspiration.<a

	In the end, a "serious turn" suggests that the woodcut comic book is just
a damn good way to spend an afternoon; it reveals itself slowly but yields a
lasting impression (Groucho Marx eyebrow twitch...).

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[The key difference
between film, particularly animation, and comics is that comics don't move.
Rather, our eyes move over the panels in a way that is both linear and
sequential and ex/implosive and radiating.   A great irony of the superhero
comic is that the substance of its plot is all action, hence the
preponderance of "POW!s" and "BAM!s" and heroes frozen in poses of swinging,
slugging, flying, and leaping. Furthermore, the superhero comic is predicated
on the momentous event, the apocalyptic destruction of the world is
perpetually on the horizon.

	<!--more-->

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/action-comics
-number-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-842"
title="action-comics-number-1"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/action-comics-
number-1-193x300.jpg" alt="" width="193" height="300" /></a>

	It is not surprising then that comics that react against the superhero
comic tend to downplay the notion of action, even to the point of nullifying
it altogether. Yes, <em>Jimmy Corrigan, The Smartest Kid on Earth</em>
includes events, but not particularly momentous ones, at least not in the
contemporary part of the story. Jimmy's foot gets run over. His Dad's car
gets stolen. "POW" is replaced by the "drip" of Jimmy's nose. Think of all
those frames that are effectively "still life" or empty spaces.

	Jason Shiga's <em>Empire State</em> is another version of the "inaction
comic." It's subtitle "A Love Story (Or Not)" gives on the one hand and takes
away with parentheses on the other, freezing the story in indeterminacy. And
there is something Corrigan-esque about this Jimmy; he can't make it with
girls, and his mother is a pain in the neck. He's a tech geek (though perhaps
not a particularly skilled one) who works at the library and fiddles with his
website. Shiga draws Jimmy, and most of the rest of his characters, in a way
that can only be described as "schlumpy." Their shoulders are round, and
their heads big.  They do not possess the "pecs and pipes" of the superhero.
Rather they look like they have just emerged from a cocoon and have not quite
straightened out yet. They look burdened and unassertive. When Jimmy's friend
Sara says, "I prefer someone passive and weak-willed who I can push around,"
it barely registers as ironic.

	The arc of the story is that Sara, the love interest (or not), moves to
New York. Lovelorn (or not), Jimmy decides to chase after her.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/
Empire_State_pg26_detail.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium
wp-image-843" title="Empire_State_pg26_detail"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/
Empire_State_pg26_detail-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>

	He writes her a letter that declares he wants to meet her on the
observation floor of the Empire State Building on Presidents' Day,
(Valentine's Day has already passed), sort of like  <em>Sleepless in
Seattle</em> , a gesture that he calls "simultaneously unoriginal and
psychotic." Jimmy's gambit doesn't work. Before bidding Jimmy goodbye at the
airport, Sara give him a hug, "just to get you through the next year or two."
The hug links Jimmy to one of Sara's dates from the past, whom she met
through a dating service. He was 400 pounds and had to use ski polls to keep
his knees from buckling. Sara made out with him because "I just didn't want
to treat him the same way every other woman does."

	The failure of the journey to New York from Oakland undercuts the whole
notion of heroic action and "epic" adventure. Not to mention any romantic
comedy conventions that the allusion to <em>Sleepless in Seattle</em> gives
rise to. The only "action" in <em>Empire State</em> is Jimmy hitting Sara in
the eye with a slushball: "Splat!"

	As with <em>Jimmy Corrigan</em>, the chief existential problem in
<em>Empire State</em> is the central character's inability to achieve
adulthood in the modern world: "I'm an adult. I should have a newspaper
subscription. I should be smoking a pipe and attending the opera regularly."
Jimmy imagines that growing up should be like Luke Skywalker's character
growth in the <em>Star Wars</em> movies: "Like, do you remember how in the
first two 'Star Wars' movies Luke is this bratty little kid. But then you see
him in 'Jedi' and he's a total badass." The analogy is probably not the best
one for someone seeking maturity because it is so associated with the
childhood imagination. But it is also an analogy based on confidence gained
through heroic exploits. What makes Luke a "badass" is action. Furthermore,
that action is based on zen-like self-surrender, a "force" that Jimmy can
have no access to because he is so self-preoccupied.

	At times it seems as if graphic novels like <em>Empire State</em> and
<em>Jimmy Corrigan, The Smartest Kid on Earth</em> are so intent on
dismissing the possibility of super heroic transformation that they dismiss
any possibility of transformation whatsoever: losers don't get bitten by
spiders and become heroes; they just stay losers. When Grant Morrison was
recently taken to task for criticizing Chris Ware for his negativity, I
believe that this "inaction" is what he was getting at. So, we might say,
welcome to the bi-polar world of comics: the mania of the superhero comic at
one end and the melancholy of the inaction comic at the other. Neither pole
has any greater claim to "realism" than the other. Total losers are just as
unlikely as Superman.

	The inaction of <em>Empire State</em> made me appreciate the genius of
Bryan Lee O'Malley's <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>. Scott is a character not
entirely unlike Jimmy in <em>Empire State</em>; he's a bass player for
goodness' sake. But he does play in the band. And he fights evil
ex-boyfriends in spectacular battles to win Ramona.  O'Malley presents a deft
version of the "have your cake and eat it too" version of the loser/hero
dichotomy of the super hero comic. In doing so he re-iterates the
existentialist ethic of the super-hero comic: everyone must choose and act as
if the world depended on it.

	I loved <em>Empire State</em>. John Pham's colours are gorgeous when
combined with Shiga's atmospheric images of Oakland and New York, and Shiga's
arrangement of the panels on the page makes the reader appreciate the process
of reading comics more than any text this side of Mazzucchelli's <em>Asterios
Polyp</em>. But when I think about how critics tend to valorize inaction
comics over action comics, I can't help but recall a comment that David Lee
Roth once made, which goes something like this: "Most music critics prefer
Elvis Costello to Van Halen because most music critics look like Elvis
Costello."]]></content:encoded>

<title>#45 Scott Pilgrim Again: Masculinity and Fighting and Gayness and
Such</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm almost done talking
about Scott Pilgrim.

	For a while, anyway.  I guess.

	But before I do, we have to talk dudeness in the series.  Because it's
complicated.  Issues around homosexuality, masculinity, and violence abound
in the narrative, and work together to create a complex picture of
contemporary maleness.  Let's start with Wallace Wells: Fabulous Gay
Roommate.

	<!--more-->

	<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-858"
title="tumblr_lhpeezwYHp1qea22qo1_r2_500"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/
tumblr_lhpeezwYHp1qea22qo1_r2_500.jpg" alt="" width="471" height="700"
/>Wallace, however, is more than Scott's gay roommate -- Wallace pays all the
bills, bankrolls much of Scott's social life, and acts as a protective, older
brother figure to the terminally clueless Scott.  Without Wallace, Scott
would be homeless and penniless; Scott is, as Wallace points out, his "bitch
forever."  On a date with Ramona, Scott tells her he has borrowed Wallace's
credit card.  Deeply unimpressed with the "agreement" Scott professes to
have, she accuses him of freeloading -- which is basically accurate.

	But Bryan Lee O'Malley isn't content to make Wallace a Gay Best Friend
archetype à la <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnvgq8STMGM">Sassy Gay
Friend</a> or the <a
href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetHomosexual">Pet
Homosexual</a>.  Instead, Wallace's sexuality is fully developed, he has
relationships outside of the framework of his relationship with Scott, he has
an identity and a set of life experiences of his own, and he doesn't simply
act as a foil to or reflection of Scott's experience.  Wallace Wells gets to
be -- wait for it -- a whole person!

	Through Wallace, O'Malley is able to challenge notions of sexual identity
and sexuality; as the breadwinner of the tiny "family" of himself and Scott,
Wallace takes on a stereotypically masculine role, but subverts it by virtue
of his homosexuality and his lack of sexual relationship to Scott.  (When
Wallace takes a sexual interest in Other Scott, however, this relationship
becomes slightly more complicated.)  Because of his unique living situation
-- he literally shares a bed with his gay roommate -- Scott spends a lot of
time (especially in volume 1) attempting to convince Ramona that he is not,
in fact, gay; O'Malley manages to create a homonormative space wherein these
two characters exist.  For all his (significant and numerous) faults, Scott's
comfort with Wallace and with his own identity are compelling aspects of his
character.

	<img class="size-full wp-image-857 alignright"
title="tumblr_lgdv314twp1qbp6pmo1_500"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/
tumblr_lgdv314twp1qbp6pmo1_500.png" alt="" width="476" height="392" />

	This homonormative apartment space is altogether interesting when
considered against the larger frame of the series: remember, the central
conceit here is a masculinized and largely heteronormative one.  Scott must
defeat Ramona's seven evil exes in order to win her hand; of course, this
very framework is challenged in a few ways, namely (1) Ramona's disinterest
in the process, and (2) the femaleness of one of the exes.  But the framework
is still one by which masculinity -- and the spoils of masculinity in the
form of the desired woman -- are achieved through physical (albeit cartoony)
violence.

	In volume three, the battle is Todd, a vegan with superpowers bestowed
upon him at a Hogwarts-like school for vegan ninja fighters.  Todd's
self-righteous veganism ("The main thing to know is that I'm better than most
people.") is what protects him, not his idealized masculine form or his
superior physical strength.  He's larger, stronger, better looking, and more
gifted than Scott, but his power of veganism (which frees up the 90% of the
brain the rest of us have weighted down by curds and whey) is what enables
him to harm Scott.  His power, then, is specifically not rooted in
masculinity or maleness, but in... diet?

	Here's the thing about <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>.  For a series all about
fighting, there's remarkably little actual fighting.  The Todd fight produces
a perfect example: about to be defeated, Scott <a
href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging?from=Main.
Lampshaded">lampshades</a> us: "I need some kind of, like, last minute,
poorly-set-up, deus ex machina."  Enter the vegan police to arrest Todd for
"veganity violations" -- namely, consumption of gelato.  The upshot is that
the fight ends without Scott having to do very much of anything, though he
claims the victory proudly.  The fight isn't brawn versus brawn or even brain
versus brawn.  It's vegan versus deus ex machina.  That's got to be a new
trope.

	So while <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> is a series that appears on the surface
to reify a heteronormative, fairy-tale-like worldview -- rescue the princess,
defeat the monsters -- it is more complicated than that specifically because
O'Malley seems committed to continually challenging that heteronormativity.
 How masculinity is defined is always sliding and shifting, whether through
Wallace's subverted patriarchal role or Todd's vegan power.  This is part of
what makes the <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> series so much more complex and
interesting than it first appears.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Our report from the
First International Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels: <a
href="http://www.institutofranklin.net/en/conferences/graphic-novel">Sites of
Visual and Textual Innovation</a>" at the <a
href="http://www.institutofranklin.net/en">Instituto Franklin</a> in Alcala
de Henares, Spain.

	<!--more--> <h2><strong>Day 1</strong></h2> Having missed the panels on
the first day of the "<a
href="http://www.institutofranklin.net/en/conferences/graphic-novel">Sites of
Visual and Textual Innovation</a>" conference at the <a
href="http://www.institutofranklin.net/en">Instituto Franklin</a> in Alcala
de Henares, Spain because of a late flight, today (Thursday November 10,
2011) was all action.

	One of the highlights of the day was <a
href="http://www.csm.arts.ac.uk/research/staffresearchprofiles/drrogersabin/"
>Roger Sabin</a>'s keynote talk on <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sloper">Ally Sloper</a>, the
Victorian comic, and promotional culture in England. While Sabin estimated
that only 1% of English people today know about Sloper, in his time, he was
hugely popular with the working class. Sabin's emphasis was on the "paratext"
in <em>Ally Sloper</em>, the advertisements, contests, and other materials
that showed Ally Sloper spilling out of the comic and entering other cultural
forms.

	The range of good papers included <a
href="http://chi.academia.edu/IanHague">Ian Hague</a>'s "Comics as a Tactile
Medium" on the "feel" of comics both paper and digital and how the haptic,
tactile experience informs the way we perceive comics. <a
href="http://comicsforum.org/">He talked</a> about how the shape and hardness
of Spiegelman's <em>In the Shadow of No Towers</em> related to enduring
memories of 9/11 and various force feedback mechanisms (vibrations and such)
in digital versions of Brian O'Malley's <em>Scott Pilgrim.</em>

	The conference represents the wide variety of research being done on
comics today, from avant garde work to mass produced superhero comics. But
more than criticism is on offer. Practitioners such as Joris Vermassen are
also talking about their work. Vermassen showed his work on a new form of
combining images (paintings and drawings) and 200 word stories. It involves
20 by 20 centimeter panels that can interact with each other in various ways.
While Vermassen produces traditional comics, he is finding the new form a
liberating one. I eagerly anticipate the results.

	<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Day 2</span> <div>

	At long last, I report on my second day at the <a
href="http://pepoperez.blogspot.com/2011/11/el-congreso.html"><em>First
International Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels</em></a> in Alcala de
Henares, Spain. These are, of course, just highlights from my perspective.
And I invite any correction to my presentation of these talks.

	Pedro Moura, "A Typology of Experimentation in Comics"

	Moura presented a fascinating tour through the various manifestations of
avant garde, non-narrative comics. Moura follows Deleuze and Guattari in
seeking an absolutely deterritorialized comics, a minor comics. That is, he
is not interested in comics that "experiment" only to re-assert conventional
storytelling and meaning. Rather, he seeks a kind of comic that is only
comic, not a vehicle for narrative content.

	Thomas Byers, "Comix Theory: The Justice League of Europe's Attack on
Deconstruction"

	Byers presented a critique of phallic displacement in a little-known DC
comic in which the Justice League of Europe, under the temporary leadership
of Batman, take on "Deconstructo" a villain who espouses a kind of aesthetic
nihilism and relativism. Byers reads the comic as a typical attack on
deconstruction, aligning it with the New York Times' notorious obituary for
Jacques Derrida. Byers turns the comic on its head, revealing its anxiety
over the loss of the phallus. He justified the Lacanian turn in his argument
because of the way that all theory tends to be lumped together in the eyes of
its detractors.

	Jose Alaniz, "Czech Comics Anthropology: Life and Story in Keva"

	Alaniz discussed the project of ASTA SME which combines comics and
anthropology. <em>Keva</em> is one volume in a trilogy focusing on the Roma
in the Czech republic. Keva is the youngest and most integrated of the three
subjects. The novel element of this comic is the way it engages with the life
of the subject. For instance, the authors asked Keva how she wished to be
drawn in the text. Her response was a composite of pop culture icons. She
wanted the legs of Mariah Carey, for instance. Alaniz referred to this kind
of text as a "negotiated story," in which the subject participates in his or
her construction. Alaniz discussed the range of drawing styles in the book,
from cartoony to something approaching photo-realism. This range demonstrates
the power of comics to "comment" on the content under representation. The
talk was fascinating, and <em>Keva</em> is probably worth picking up even
though it has not been translated into English.

	Simon Grennan, "Demonstrating Discours: Two Comic Strip Projects in Self
Constraint"

	Grennan's main point was that comics narratology has focused on
"histoire," what is told, rather than "discours," the putting into action of
the story, or the "telling to." Grennan used a page from Seth's <em>Clyde
Fans</em> and Mike Madden's <em>99 Ways to Tell A Story</em>. Each of these
texts works with a constraint. Seth restricts himself to the temporal and
stylistic conventions of the <em>New Yorker</em> magazine, with nothing
appearing that is not "American" or post 1960, while Madden writes the same
story over and over again according to different generic principles. Grennan
argued that Seth's work made sense in terms of discours, while Madden's
simply repeated his own style over and over again. In other words, Seth's
working within the constraint works, while Madden's doesn't because
"discours" contradicts "histoire," particularly in the version of his story
that employs the fantasy genre. <h2>Day 3</h2> </div> <div>

	From my perspective, the last day of the <a
href="http://www.institutofranklin.net/en">Instituto Franklin</a> comics
conference in Alcala was perhaps the best for me in terms of developing my
own understanding of how comics work.

	<img title="More..."
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/
img/trans.gif" alt="" />The early morning "Theory" session featured <a
href="http://castle.eiu.edu/agora/Dec03/Kuipall.htm">Chris Kuipers</a>, a
fellow alumnus from the University of California, Irvine, arguing that the
graphic novel as the latest "royal genre," following on from the novel and
the epic in "Epic, Roman, Graphic Novel: Three Royal Genres". A "royal" genre
governs the way literature is thought about in any particular era, embodying
the technology of the period, which is partly responsible for its
transformation and incorporation of previous genres. The comic's engagement
with web technology is a component of its potential for dominance. <a
href="http://www.iup.edu/page.aspx?id=58879">Kuipers</a> pointed out that
"graphic novel" is a weak term for this kind of text; it is a term trying to
gain credibility from a past genre, and does not adequately represent what
long form comics are.

	<a href="http://psychology.stanford.edu/btversky">Barbara Tversky</a>, a
cognitive psychologist from Stanford, presented a fascinating talk ("Aspects
of Depictions in Graphic Narratives") about how comics are perceived in terms
of action and complexity, dependent on culture. Her discussion started with
visual (iconic?) instructions, such as a blow-up diagram and instructions on
how to put together a bookshelf, and related how the mind processes them to
the way it processes a comic.

	Nicolas Thiessen, in "You Don't Know How to Read a Comic" took issue with
formalist approaches to reading comics, suggesting that the intuited pattern
of moving from left to right and top to bottom was in no way a necessity. His
argument hinged on the Heideggerian notion of equipment, which has no
existence as equipment separate from its use. Likewise, form does not inhere
in a comic, but rather is imposed on it through our reading of it.

	Perhaps my favorite presentation from a session on experimental narrative
was <a
href="http://www.informationenvironments.org.uk/research-projects.html">Ian
Horton</a> on "Information Design, Experimental Comic Books, and Narrative
Form." Again, Ikea and Habitat instructions played their role in getting at
how comics work. He then moved on to Will Eisner's comics instructions for
the US army to address issues of complexity and functionality in these
instructions. Horton challenged the notion that representing instructions
visually through comics does not necessarily simplify matters. H then
discussed Chris Ware's Acme Novelty Library #20, popularly known
as <em>Lint</em> to show the elements of information design that Ware has
incorporated into his overtly aestheticized work.

	The keynote, and closing, speech of the day was <a
href="http://www.csun.edu/~ch76854/">Charles Hatfield</a> appraising the
state of independent comics in 2011. Hatfield used four examples: Adrian
Tomine's latest issue of <em>Optic Nerve</em> , the latest issue of the
Hernandez brothers Love and Rockets, a licensed <em>Simpsons</em>
property, <em>Treehouse of Horror</em>, and an experimental comics
broadsheet,<em>Pood</em>. Hatfield discussed the impact of large publishing
companies like Bertelsmann and MacMillan taking on Drawn and Quarterly and
Fantagraphics titles, the diminishing power of the direct market comics shop
model, and the way that "graphic novels" as long form "high end" texts have
perhaps eclipsed the "floppy," as the slim, soft-covered, stapled comic is
commonly known. As what was formerly been independent has been co-opted by
the mainstream, Hatfield, sees mini comics and webcomics as the new
inhabitants of the independent realm.

	In giving synopses of these talks, I am sure that I have distorted them.
In order to correct that distortion, you should seek out the published
versions of these papers which are sure to come out.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[In the last six weeks
or so <a href="http://bookriot.com/author/bgray/">I started a new blogging
gig over at Book Riot</a>, which is a new online book discussion community.
 I enjoy blogging for them, not least because sometimes people send me free
books for review now.  The lovely folks at House of Anansi Press sent me
Robert Lepage, Marie Michaud, and Fred Jourdain's <em>The Blue Dragon</em>,
<a
href="http://bookriot.com/2011/11/11/review-the-blue-dragon-by-robert-lepage-
marie-michaud-and-fred-jourdain/">which I reviewed for Book Riot last
weekish</a>.  Since that review, though, I've been thinking a lot about
<em>The Blue Dragon</em> and how it challenges my notions of how I engage
with graphic narratives.

	<!--more-->

	Like the rest of the Graphixia team, I'm an English scholar by training.
 I know about words and word-like stuff.  I love graphic narratives
(obviously) and like to think I've become a good critical reader of visual
texts (see post history for evidence for disagreement), but I realized while
reading <em>The Blue Dragon</em> that I am still guilty of privileging the
written narrative over the graphic; that is, I look first to the story, and
then look to the ways the images augment or complicate or ironize the story.
 I'm still not, I think, reading as a cohesive whole.

	<em>The Blue Dragon </em>made this clear to me because the visual imagery
is so central; page after page the dialogue is subsumed by the graphics, as
you can see in these (admittedly terrible and from my cell phone, sorry)
pictures.  (The book is a gorgeous, huge 9x12 volume and hard to scan.)  If I
were to minimize the visual in this text I would miss the whole point; its
sweeping, epic power emerges from these magnificent painterly images.  They
are ignored at my own peril.

	I don't think this is strictly, for me, a matter of lacking critical
tools -- I've read all the old standbys like <em>Understanding Comics</em>. I
think it comes down to the fact that I have been trained and wired to consume
texts in a particular way, so if I'm not consciously foregrounding the
visual, my default position is to privilege the story.

	Part of the resolution, I think, is for me to read more of these sorts of
graphic narratives where the visual imagery refuses to be seen as merely a
servant to the more traditional narrative.  In effect, I need to retrain
myself to focus on the visual.  My taste normally runs to sparse imagery
(like <em><a title="#34 Memory and Mimesis: Internal Tension in Sarah
Leavitt’s Tangles"
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2011/08/01/34-memory-and-mimesis-
internal-tension-in-sarah-leavitts-tangles/">Tangles: A Memoir of
Alzheimer's, My Mother, and Me</a></em>or <em><a title="#18 Louis Riel’s
Legacy"
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2011/04/01/louis-riels-legacy/">Louis
Riel: A Comic Strip Biography</a></em>, both of which I've discussed before
on Graphixia); in such comics, I am often rewarded for primarily seeing the
visual images as complimentary or complicating factors rather than the main
event.  I'm working on stepping out of that comfort zone and focusing more on
texts where the driving force is the visually imagery.

	<em>The Blue Dragon</em> is a good first step in this direction.  The
imagery is theatrical, grand, and fantastic in its depth -- Jourdain's
painting-like illustrations evoke both the central motif of the
commodification of art and the larger emotional canvas of the narrative.  I
can't default to the written narrative here because so much is primarily in
the images.

	So here I start rethinking the privilege of prose and elevating the image
in my conception of comics.

	Say that three times fast.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Given that I’m a
heavily invested comic book collector who purchases (and<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/new52-1.jpg">
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-909"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/new52-1-
194x300.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="300" /></a> reads) nearly a hundred
titles a month, many other collectors and casual readers have been asking for
my take on the recent DC reboot of its entire superhero comics’ franchise.
This reboot, which DC dubbed “The New 52,” signals a sea change in the
publishing magnate’s history – for the first time, DC restarted the longest
running of its titles, Action and Detective comics, along with every other
title in its superhero canon, resetting all 52 titles of the DC Universe all
to issue #1. The only titles left unscathed were those from its Vertigo
imprint, with Hellblazer now being DC’s longest running, continuous monthly
ongoing series. The reboot is, however, not just a simple renumbering of DC’s
titles (they had tried that previously with several other series in the mid
1980s after “Crisis on Infinite Earths,” though not with its longer running
titles that had been established in the Golden Age), but a complete overhaul
of the line, with all continuity rules revoked and all characters’ histories,
costumes and environments rendered mutable for a new generation of authors
and readers. In this universe, Superman has never met Batman and he is new to
the public eye (no underwear on the outside of their costumes either now),
the Justice League is a new invention, and Dick Grayson has apparently never
been Batman – none of the nuances, and often even the broad strokes, of the
stories of the last seventy-plus years are meant to carry any weight
regarding character development. This was a significant gamble on the part of
DC’s creative team of Dan DiDio, Jim Lee and Geoff Johns, and while the
general mainstream media thought that the move was compelling, the message
boards on DC’s website showed significant skepticism and, at times, outright
hostility; why were these characters, with whom readers had identified and
grown up with, being completely revamped? Moreover, does “The New 52”
actually meet these expectations? Despite the general protests to the
contrary. These answers lie not in the creative, cerebral process of writing,
but in the nuts and bolts of the publishing industry itself.

	<!--more-->

	First, however, a little recent history for those who are unfamiliar with
the lead-up to “The New 52” and how it came about in the DC Universe. DC’s
Chief Creative Officer, Geoff Johns, began the reboot with his summer event

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/fp_teaser2-
1024x703.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-912"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/fp_teaser2-
1024x703-300x205.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="205" /></a>Flashpoint, a
miniseries that spanned thirteen separate three-issue arcs plus several one
shots (the total issue count for the story rounding out at a planned 52). The
plotline centres on the Flash, Johns’ staple character who he’d written for
years previously. Barry Allen, the recently resuscitated Silver Age Flash, is
thrown into a universe rife with discontinuities such as Batman’s secret
identity being Thomas Wayne (Bruce having been shot instead of his parents),
half of Europe having been sunk in a war between Atlantis and the Amazons,
and Superman having been found by the military instead of by the Kents,
locked up as a secret weapon for the US government. The stories see some very
talented writers being given free rein to upset character conventions and
essentially trace out a “What If?” of the DCU in a fashion similar to what
Marvel had accomplished (with great success) a few years prior with its
summer event “House of M.” The cause of the skewing of continuity (spoiler
alert), is Professor Zoom’s time traveling murder of Barry Allen’s mother, a
problem that gets remedied (through means too complex to discuss here) by the
end of Flashpoint. The final pages of the last issue of the miniseries show
readers that there is indeed a logic to the then-upcoming reboot: All of the
continuities, past and present, merge into one due to Barry Allen’s tinkering
with the timestream, resetting the DC Universe into a single whole, a fresh
starting point that bears some similarities with past stories, but also one
that contains many differences. What results is the aforementioned “New 52,”
a supposed renewal and revitalization of the DCU that is, because of
Flashpoint, also speciously (almost paradoxically) aligned with current
continuity.

	Because comics are marketed to their readers three months in advance of
their publication date, comic fandom caught wind of the upset early on,
seeing that their next months’ purchase would not be Action Comics #905 <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/new52-21.png"
><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-911"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/new52-21-
300x199.png" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>but Action Comics #1, and
that this Superman would be dramatically different from the character they
had previously known. Responding to the often vitriolic comments from fans on
the message boards, DiDio published, at the back of every DC comic book two
months prior to “The New 52,” the logic and motivation behind the change,
followed by an impassioned request to keep readers reading, regardless of the
fact that the current stories would be written out of continuity only a
couple months in the future. As DiDio himself put it, “Why buy DC comics in
August? After all, if everything is starting over in September, why not just
wait to start reading books again?” DiDio, at the close of his response,
provides the answer that one should remain a DC reader “because you love
comics, and we make some of the best ones out there.” The request itself is
interesting in that it addresses the concerns that readers had regarding the
reboot at all – if they were significant enough to merit a full-page
addressing in every issue of the DCU, then one wonders why the company would
have opted for the change in the first place. The company line itself seems
torn as well in both denying the import of continuity in superhero comics
while reaffirming it at the same time; DC’s Executive Editor writes of
Flashpoint that “[what’s] appearing here pretty much sets you up for DC – The
New 52. You can’t let Flashpoint go as something that does not count. It’s
the gateway into what’s coming in September.” The paradox was something of a
problem for readers, who were being told to ignore continuity while at the
same time being told to purchase DC strictly because of it.

	The answer lies in something that we have discussed very little in
Graphixia, being the fact that comics, beyond their content, are marketable
goods. The costs of their publication are increasing, from paper to ink to
artists’ wages, and DC plays (or played) second string to Marvel’s market
dominance for some time now. Coupled with this, print media in general is in
a steady decline. The print runs of even DC’s most successful titles (in
Justice League and Green Lantern) were dropping significantly, and the
company was struggling to maintain relevance. DiDio called, in a letters page
similar to the one discussed above, for a throwback to the popularity of
comics in the 1990s (which, admittedly, killed the market due to
overpublication) with the return of variant covers, polybagged issues and
marketing techniques that would allow the company to thrive in this changing
environment – ironically, what was needed was a return to past efforts. The
new 52 #1 issues then were then accompanied by a host of variant covers as
well as a polybagged Justice League #1 which included a code to access the
comic online, viewable on the <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/new52-41.jpg"
><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-915"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/new52-41.jpg"
alt="" width="193" height="300" /></a>iPad or a similar eReader, along with
DC’s promise that all new publications would be available for purchase on the
DC website the same day that they hit comic shop shelves. Beyond this, DiDio
claimed that the new #1s would draw in new readers who had been, to this
point, put off by the long-running histories that were potentially
ostracizing to a readership unfamiliar with them or unwilling to do the
required, often grueling research to get caught up with current continuity.
Everyone, DiDio exclaimed, can now own their own copy of Action Comics #1
(albeit a problematic claim, given that the company was attempting to divorce
its own history while relying on the historical popularity of both its titles
and characters).

	The plan was, in short, incredibly effective. The marketing campaign,
which was as far reaching as traditional newspapers and television, resulted
in DC’s selling out of every title, with multiple prints having to be offered
for the more popular titles – Justice League #1 is currently on its fourth
printing, and several other titles have reached their third. Needless to say,
for the last few months Marvel has been soundly trounced (despite an effort
to copy DC’s newfound popularity by resetting its own long-running title
Uncanny X-Men to issue #1 this month). DC has indeed returned to the sales
figures of the past, at least for the time being, though the effectiveness of
the long-term applications of the reboot remains in question. The problem
lies in the fact that DC did not live up to its intended concept regarding
the writing of its titles – it has marketed incredibly well, but the problems
with content limiting the readership, a point that has been previously noted
both in Graphixia’s podcasts and posts, remain. DC may have sold thousands
more copies than anticipated of its #1s, though it did not sell the stories
that it promised its readers.

	“The New 52” is a melee of authors experimenting with the titles they
have written for for, in many cases, several years. Understandably, however,
there appears to have been some significant resistance to the reboot on the
part of some of the authors, especially as regards the Green Lantern host of
titles – the authors here, Peter Tomasi, Tony Bedard, Peter Milligan and
Johns himself, haven’t missed a beat and are writing, despite the #1 on the
cover of their books, as nuanced and detailed stories that are directly
reliant on the <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/new52-61.jpg"
><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-916"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/new52-61-
196x300.jpg" alt="" width="196" height="300" /></a>previous story arcs as if
nothing had happened in the franchise. Flashpoint is not referred to, nor are
there any noticeable alterations of continuity at all in the Green Lantern
universe - in fact, in the aftermath of the recent "War of the Green
Lanterns" arc that spanned three titles and a separate miniseries, it is more
important than ever to do back reading to make sense of the current
"entrypoint" that DC has established with the new #1 Green Lantern titles.
Action Comics and Superman, however, are at odds even with each other, with
Grant Morrison on the former title apparently being given carte blanche to
write Superman as he sees fit without acknowledging even the continuity that
is being newly established (as he did with his much lauded “All-Star
Superman”) in the other Superman related series. Other titles have arisen
seemingly to fill the number count of 52, with little in the way of content
or storytelling – these are, most notably, Liefeld’s “Hawk and Dove” and J T
Krul’s tepid take on “Green Arrow,” though there are several others that fall
into this category. One is left wondering how long the 52 titles can last
without a cancellation in their midst, though it’s too early to speculate at
this point. That said, some of the titles have shown some promise, including
Tony Daniels’ “Detective Comics” and, most especially, newcomers like Jeff
Lemire’s “Animal Man,” though these were arguably strong and innovative
titles prior to the relaunch as well, and little has changed in their
telling.

	How then, do I respond, when people ask me about what I think about “The
New 52”? My answer is typically “not much.” The stories that were strong
prior to the reboot remain strong, largely because their authors have ignored
the mandate of their publishing company; the weaker stories and characters
remain weak, despite the presence of popular and up-and-coming authors; the
new stories could have been told without the fanfare of the reboot at all.
What I have to acknowledge however, especially given my print culture
background, is that the reboot was necessary – without it, the company would
likely have failed within a few years, with its characters being sold to
other houses or being lost forever, much as what happened with Archie’s now
defunct superhero line of comics or the critically acclaimed Miracleman by
Alan Moore, which is currently held up in copyright limbo. In a sort of
metacommentary on DC’s situation, Lois Lane identifies the problem herself in
the new Superman #1. Referencing the destruction of the Daily Planet to make
way for a new Planet owned and operated by the larger Galaxy Media, a
self-professed “multimedia news super station,” she attests to a troubled
Clark Kent that “You’ve seen the reports! You’ve seen the figures! Print is
dying! We need this to survive!” It appears that if “The New 52” has been
effective at anything, it is in the success of market dominance, if not a
return to successful storytelling. This is likely why the creative team has
been so problematic, as previously mentioned, in writing about the changes to
the DCU themselves; there is a hint of Janus about the turn, in the attempt
to draw in new readers with the promise of new continuities while quietly
ensuring that the old readers are not left behind, even if they are telling
us to expect a complete overhaul. What remains is a cunning revival of the
comic as a product, a highlighting of the import of the commoditization of
the story and the need to ensure the vitality of the market through whatever
means necessary, regardless of how extreme they may at first appear. More
uplifting, however, is a similar note from aforementioned Superman #1 that is
a little more optimistic: the new owner of the Daily Planet (read DC), Morgan
Edge, states to a press conference, “I know that many of you are greeting
this day with mixed emotions and perhaps even some trepidation. After all,
change is seldom easy. In fact, it can be downright painful. But, to
paraphrase and mutilate the words of William Shakespeare: I’ve come not to
bury the Planet, but to raise it.” Despite the dramatic overtones of the
supposed “change,” this reader, at least, is glad of gimmicky nature of “The
New 52,” if only because it means the continuation of the superhero comics’
industry and DC’s relevance in the world of print
publication.]]></content:encoded>

proclaimed<em> <a href="http://www.comicstriplibrary.org/">Krazy Kat</a></em>
“the most amusing and fantastic and satisfactory work of art produced in
America today” (<em>The Seven Lively Arts</em> 22). Herriman’s <em>Krazy
Kat</em>, a comic strip that ran from 1913 to 1944, took its aesthetic cues
from Surrealism, Cubism, and Dadaism, and is distinctive for distorted and
shifting landscapes that plunge in and out of the strip’s panels all the
while presenting the recurring adventures of Ignatz the mouse and his attempt
to “krease the Kat’s bean with a brick.”

	Made into an <a

post-modern novel</a> and even <a
href="http://www.amazon.ca/Krazy-Kat-Song-Dance-DVD/dp/1606994433">a
ballet</a>, Krazy Kat has had its share of admirers, among them poet and
artist E. E. Cummings.

	<!--more-->

	An avid collector of <em>Krazy Kat</em> comic strips, Cummings was always
on the look-out for what he once called the “Kat of indescribably beauty”
(30). Describing himself as “An author of pictures, a draughtsman of words,”
Cummings occupies a unique position as both painter and poet. Cummings works
both sides of the representational fence conscientiously accounting for
visual and auditory signals of language. Like Herriman, Cummings was playful
with the genre, breaking conventions and confounding expectations--well,
except for the brick to the head thing.

	Like the illustrator and writer of a comic strip, Cummings is very
conscious of the formal arrangement of the page as it signals audible
remarks, image forms, and narrative logic. Cummings devoured <em>Krazy
Kat</em> comics sent to him by friends in America while he was living in the
Paris milieu of the 1920s and all its converging artistic movements. During
this time, he also adopted the strip’s alliterative “K” in his letters and
was beginning in earnest to explore the stylistic techniques that would come
to identify his poetry so forcefully. Cummings’ move to break the poetic
line, place an emphasis on vernacular language, and a highly visual
formulation of the page-space, all find their counterparts in the daily
<em>Krazy Kat</em> strips.  Herriman’s playful use of the vernacular, his
“strictly irrational landscape in perpetual metamorphosis”—as Cummings called
it—and his presentation of the ordinary within the philosophical discourses
of self-discovery, appeal to Cummings’ own sense of poetic expression.
Moreover, both artists engage in sustained attempts to expand and explode the
grammar of their media. By pushing traditional modes of expression in areas
such as the line, space, syntax, alliteration, and logic, Herriman and
Cummings operate through a creative paradigm that is highly intellectual and
incorporates humour, pictorial representation and linguistic play.

	In an essay about <em>Krazy Kat</em>, published in the 1946 <em>Sewanee
Review </em>and included in a later Collection of Herriman's<em> Krazy Kat
</em>strips, Cummings calls the strip “a meteoric burlesk melodrama” (30).
The characterization is interesting when taken in concert with Cummings'
 "technical" explanation for his poetry in 1926’s <em>is 5</em>: “I can
express it in fifteen words, by quoting The Eternal Question And Immortal
Answer of burlesque: “Would you hit a woman with a child?—No, I’d hit her
with a brick” (180). In qualifications about the nature of art and
aesthetics, Cummings frequently refers to elements of the burlesque as they
appear in <em>Krazy Kat</em>, highlighting its emphasis on play, humour, and
its ability to push the boundaries of what constitutes acceptable
representation. In Cummings' letters, he refers to the “the irrefutable
down-to-earth authenticity of burlesk” with “its gift of fearlessness, its
devastating habit of suddenly debunking the most sacred pomposities. It can
be seen miraculously coupled with an infallible pity which is the prerogative
of genius." These same qualities are apparent in Herriman's comic strip.

	Taking the unity between Cummings’ stern support of individuality in art
and life as a cue, there are clearly lines of force between popular culture,
the burlesque, <em>Krazy Kat</em>, and Cummings’ formal aesthetics in poetry.
The question is, do these supposed similarities between the construction of
modernist popular art—burlesque, comic strips—give us access to a new set of
definitional criteria through which to understand and define modernist
artistic practice more generally, and in those genres we deem "intellectual"
or "traditional" or <span style="text-decoration:
underline;"><strong>A</strong></span>rtistic? There's a ton of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krazy_Kat">commentary on <em>Krazy
Kat</em></a> and Herriman on the internets. Do yourself a favour and check
into the dialogue. Herriman's strip is one of the most critically
interrogated and intellectually lauded of all time. Sometimes, I must admit,
I'm not quite sure why; what with the brick to the head thing over and over
and over.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Peter Wilkins and David
N. Wright started the <em>Graphixia</em> blog over a year ago. It began as a
writing project on Google Documents in which Peter and Dave traded paragraphs
on comics in a quasi-critical dialogue, trying to figure out if they had
anything notable to say about comics.

	After one false start, Peter and Dave set up <em>Graphixia</em> as a
weekly writing project to replace the now flagging Google Documents exchange.
The idea was to produce 500 words per post on whatever struck their interest
about comics. Things really took off when Brenna Clarke Gray and Scott
Marsden joined the conversation, diversifying the blog’s content and
broadening its critical horizons.

	In order to maintain momentum and improve content, <em>Graphixia</em>
presents this 50th post setting the following goals for the coming year: <ul>
<li>improve the quality of content making it more akin to that found in an
academic journal</li> <li>produce a style sheet and ensure that posts are
properly documented</li> <li>establish a backlog of posts in order to ensure
regular publication every Tuesday at 6:00 AM</li> <li>produce at least 4
podcasts per year at scheduled intervals during the seasonal solstice</li>
<li>invite and peer-review submissions</li> <li>network with other,
like-minded blogs and comics researchers to raise the profile of comics
scholarship</li> <li>explore different ways to use web resources and computer
technology to enhance the discussion of comics and to link that discussion
with the broader endeavours of the Digital Humanities</li> <li>produce an
“Annual” that publishes its yearly work in either e-book or print form</li>
<li>submit papers to comics conferences and journals to enhance our
reputation as a hub of comics scholarship and investigate institutional
affiliations</li> <li>host an academic conference of 3-5 days in the summer
of 2013.</li> </ul> Thanks to everyone for continuing to read and support
<em>Graphixia</em> this year. We look forward to providing more insightful
and enthusiastic commentary on comics. If you are a comics scholar,
practitioner, or fan, consider submitting a post idea to <em>Graphixia</em>.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[When I read Tintin
books as a child, their politics were never an issue. I only concerned myself
with adventure and the delightful drawings and colours. Hergé’s earliest
efforts, <em>Tintin in the Land of the Soviets</em> and <em>Tintin in the
Congo</em>--crude, unresearched endeavors--were not available. <em>Tintin in
America</em> with its “red” Indians and Al Capone seemed innocent enough in
the 1970s, particularly from a Canadian perspective; we held all the
stereotypes about the United States that the book did. So it has been a
surprise to return to the early Tintin and find politics all over the place.
These politics were complicated by editorial requirements. <em>Tintin in the
Land of the Soviets</em> and <em>Tintin in the Congo </em>were commissioned
by Abbé Norbert Wallez, Hergé’s editor at <em>Le Petit Vingtième</em>, as
anti-Soviet propaganda and an endorsement of Belgian rule respectively (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tintin">The Adventures
of Tintin</a>). So it is as difficult to grasp Hergé’s actual politics from
them as it is to glean anything about the inner psyche of his hero. Except to
say that Hergé was perfectly willing to write such texts for his conservative
Roman Catholic newspaper, just as he was willing to put Tintin in <em>Le
Soir</em>, the same French language, pro-occupation paper that Paul de Man
wrote for during World War II (<a
href="http://www.cbc.ca/books/2012/01/herge-the-the-difficult-herg-the-
difficult-past-of-tintins-creator.html">CBC Books</a>). By all accounts,
though, <em>The Blue Lotus </em>marks a turn for Hergé. In this book, he
shifts from stereotype and fantasy to research and detail (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Lotus">The Blue Lotus</a>).
Instead of making unreflective, stereotypical representations of nations as
he does with The Soviet Union, The Congo, and The United States, Hergé tries
to represent China of the 1930s with accuracy and sympathy. By doing so, he
disparages European colonial powers, but more importantly, Japan.

	<!--more-->

	Page 6 of <em>The Blue Lotus,</em> with its striking page layout, is the
crucial one for establishing Hergé’s cultural negotiatons. A typical Tintin
page consists of four rows of panels of uniform height and variable width.
Each row generally contains three to four panels. This page, however,
consists of typical top and bottom rows with a large streetscape panel
occupying the space usually taken by the middle two rows. The way this middle
panel anchors and controls the way we read the top row of panels, which
refers to the Japanese arch-villain Mr Mitsuhirato, and the bottom row of
panels, which depicts the crude racism of the European Gibbons, establishes
the political hegemony of Tintin over China, that is, the hegemony of the
“true” European as opposed to the perverse and arrogant European represented
by Gibbons and the slick, deceptive Japanese Mr Mitsuhirato.

	The top three panels across the top show Tintin responding to a letter
from Mr. Mitsuhirato and preparing to call upon him. <p style="text-align:
center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Top.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989" title="Top"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Top.jpg"
alt="" width="543" height="183" /></a></p> We will later learn that
Mitsuhirato, drawn with a pig-nosed face, orchestrates the sabotage of the
South Manchurian railway line as a means for Japan to make further incursions
into China. For now, though, Tintin is impressed: “he’s certainly a man with
impeccable manners....” Snowy asks, “Are Japanese good chaps, Tintin?” If our
ears are attuned to irony, we will know that we are being set up here. Tintin
is too impressed, and Snowy’s comment raises doubts, questioning rather than
affirming Tintin’s opinion of Mitsuhirato. Everything in these panels is
based on the letter that Mitsuhirato has sent, not on Tintin’s first hand
experience; all his interpretations are speculative: “I wonder how Mr
Mitsuhirato knew I was here.”

	In the bottom three panels, however, Tintin literally collides with
European arrogance:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Bottom.jpg"><
img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990" title="Bottom"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Bottom.jpg"
alt="" width="545" height="198" /></a>

	A man in European dress, whom we later learn is named Gibbons, walks into
the street without looking. He is reading his newspaper as he walks,
apparently expecting all traffic to come to a halt for him. He doesn’t need
to look; the natives must look out for him. Tintin’s rickshaw driver is
unable to stop and crashes into Gibbons, who responds vehemently, holding his
cane above his head as if to strike: “Dirty little China-man!...To barge into
a white man!” So a page that begins with a reflection on the “impeccable
manners” displayed in Mitsuhirato’s letter ends with an exhibition of utmost
rudeness from Gibbons.

	&nbsp;

	The large middle frame turns the page into a dialectic with Tintin being
the term that mediates and supersedes Mitsuhirato and Gibbons.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Middle.jpg"><
img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991" title="Middle"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Middle.jpg"
alt="" width="549" height="376" /></a>

	The wide angle streetscape offers a comprehensive picture of harmony,
anchored by  Tintin and Snowy in the back of the rickshaw. Tintin looks
resplendent, even princely, in this panel. Both he and Snowy sit politely,
almost primly. While the Rickshaw driver’s ribs are showing and his mouth is
open to get as much air in him as possible, the other faces in the panel are
smiling. A close look at the panel reveals boxes, pails, buckets and baskets
as most people are carrying something, suggesting industry. Banners cross the
street horizontally and signs hang down vertically, creating the image of a
vibrant street: busy but orderly. Gibbons upsets that order, as we can see
from Tintin’s disordered tie, the droplets shooting from his head, and
Snowy’s raised eyebrows. We see a distinct contrast here between correct and
incorrect European behaviour, with Gibbons as the corrupt exponent of
colonial power, and “our superb western civilisation” (7) and Tintin as the
ideal version: dominant but quiet and polite. The good European fits into the
picture; he doesn’t disrupt it.

	&nbsp;

	Later in the book, Tintin saves Chang Chong-chen from the river. Chang is
surprised that Tintin has saved him, given Chang’s presumptions about
westerners: “I thought all white devils were wicked, like those who killed my
grandfather and grandmother long ago,” referring to the Boxer Rebellion.
Tintin responds with mid 1930s multiculturalism: “You see, different peoples
don’t know enough about each other” (43). He then goes through a list of
European misconceptions about the Chinese: “all Chinese are cunning and cruel
and wear pigtails, are always inventing tortures, and eating rotten eggs and
swallows’ nests...” (43). Right after Tintin runs through this list, Hergé
cuts to a panel with Mitsuhirato and his pig nose. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Pig-nose.jpg"
><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1001" title="Pig nose"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Pig-nose.jpg"
alt="" width="250" height="231" /></a>The juxtaposition is incredible, as
though Hergé is blind to the import of his own character’s words. Different
peoples don’t know enough about each other; they have preconceptions and
prejudices that we must see through...and by the way, here’s an image of a
Japanese man with a pig face. The sociable understanding that Tintin and
Chang come to about their people’s prejudices towards each other clearly does
not extend to the Japanese. We can erase notions of Chinese foot-binding and
infanticide and Western devils from our heads, but not the piggish qualities
of the Japanese.

	Whatever <em>The Blue Lotus</em> says about European arrogance, racism,
and entitlement is redeemed by the doubling of Tintin and Chang: two boys who
overcome their differences and work together: “What a good friend you are,
Chang!” (47). But Mitsuhirato has no redemptive qualities and no explanation
that his evil is particular and individual rather than representative of a
whole people. Gibbons’ brutality on page 6 is offset by Tintin’s politeness
and western apologism. Mitsuhirato’s “impeccable manners” in his letter to
Tintin are simply and thoroughly undercut.

	&nbsp;

	At the end of the day, <em>The Blue Lotus</em> is just as ideological and
stereotypical as <em>Tintin in the Land of the Soviets</em> and <em>Tintin in
the Congo</em>. Hergé critiques Europeans, but only the bad ones. He
celebrates the Chinese. But he excoriates the Japanese and does so through
animalistic caricature, foreshadowing the representation of the Japanese
during World War II when the Allies paid special attention to the “racial
differences” between the Japanese and the Chinese. While Hergé ostensibly
supports the notion that different cultures have to make more effort to
understand each other, his support extends only to friendly nations and
peoples. It is still legitimate to portray people and cultures you don’t like
as animals. This portrayal is doubly significant for the medium of comics
which depends so much on caricature, raising questions about the image of the
“enemy” in comics and its relation to the the racial other.

in Yoshihiro Tatsumi&#039;s A Drifting Life</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't know much about
manga, Japanese comics, but I know a lot more now that I have read Yoshihiro
Tatsumi's<em> A Drifting Life</em>, a "memoir" of one of the most well-known
manga creators. Tatsumi was  responsible for creating  "gekiga," a  genre of
manga that sought to differentiate itself from manga for kids, which, as
typical for comics everywhere it seems, was seen as a corrupting influence.

	<!--more-->

	I put memoir in quotation marks above because Tatsumi renames himself
Hiroshi Katsumi in the book, suggesting a distance or even displacement
between historical reality and what the book represents. However, I have seen
no reviewer call the book fiction rather than memoir. And the book has little
in it to suggest that it might be anything different than Tatsumi's own
memories of his own experience.  Still, the renaming is curious, as if
Tatsumi is objectifying himself, looking at himself as if he were someone
else.

	&nbsp;

	The memoir covers 15 years, from the end of World War II in 1945 to 1960,
the year of the Security Treaty between Japan and the US.  The state of Japan
and its national psychology after the war are always in the background, as
Tatsumi includes several key historical points, such as General MacArthur's
being removed from command in Japan in 1951. These pieces of history tend to
be drawn differently than the clear lines of the main story,  with more
shading and cross hatching.  The same is true of the many films (Japanese,
American, European) that Tatsumi refers to.  Clearly, political history and
film are the key extrinsic influences on "Katsumi's" artistic development.
Indeed, the book concludes with Katsumi drawn into a massive protest over the
Security Treaty.  The protest somehow inspires him to persist in the gekiga
genre. When he notices that "Japan, too, is adrift" (825), it makes Katsumi
somehow iconic of Japan's postwar situation, and suggests a new
socio-political bent to his work. Such work does not appear in this volume,
and readers more familiar with Tatsumi's post-1960 output will have to vouch
for, or dismiss,  this suggestion.

	&nbsp;

	The historical elements have more to do with manga's place in post-war
Japanese culture than with the manga represented in this book.   Film,
however, is much more prominent in Katsumi's artistic development. When he
can't work, Katsumi goes to the movies and incorporates filmic concepts into
his work. Anyone studying the relationship between film and comics would do
well to read this book.  Gekiga is an attempt to bring a more cinematic scope
to manga. Katsumi wants to slow stories down and develop them over greater
space than the short stories that publishers want allow.

	&nbsp;

	A Drifting Life  shows the development of a medium and the difficulties
in establishing a new genre within that medium more than the personal
development of its creator. Katsumi's father is something of a ne'erdowell
and, while his parents share the same roof, they are to all intents and
purposes separated. His brother Okimasa has pleurisy. One of his sister's
friends develops a crush on him. The few sexual or romantic relationships (a
brief dalliance with a restaurant "madam" and an episode in which Katsumi is
pursued by a forward high school girl)  are presented so as to show how
inconsequential they are.    These details of a life are just that. The real
story is of the manga.   And it is amazing how engrossing 840 pages of
meta-manga can be: the conditions of its production, the vagaries and
vicissitudes of the publishing industry and the rental manga business.  And,
apropos of last week's post, manga production is a boys' world in Japan
during the period represented in the book. There are no female artists, just
a series of rising  male stars who compete with each other in a homosocial
world. A sequence in which the manga boys do life drawing with a nude female
model who falls asleep and exposes herself in the process, shows just how
isolated they are from women.

	&nbsp;

	The tension in the memoir is between the demands of convention, even
though those demands are recent in themselves, and the desire to invent a new
mode of art. Katsumi's brother, Okimasa, another manga artist, is the voice
of conservatism and tradition.

	<a

700x442.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-646"

-300x189.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="189" /></a>When Katsumi shows him a
version of his "manga that is not manga" he says, "Frankly, I don't know if
this kind of expression is a new technique or a waste of paper"(548). 
Although he is ultimately supportive, Okimasa shows how Katsumi is trying to
break new ground. Meanwhile he competes with another manga artist, Matsumoto,
who invents his own genre, "Komaga."

	&nbsp;

	The curious thing about reading this book without having seen the work
that it refers to is how evocative it is of that work. When Tatsumi draws
manga within the text, it is usually difficult to see with any clarity, tiny
squiggles and little drawings or dark, photograph-like images. To see what
Tatsumi is writing and drawing is to imagine it from the theoretical
conversations Katsumi has with his brother or Katsumi's own reflections.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/DriftingLife.

src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/DriftingLife-
300x274.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="274" /></a>

	Performing that act of imagination engages the relationship between the
bodily eye and the mind's eye that makes comics so intellectually
interesting. With its depictions of historical moments, movie images,
undecipherable manga images, and beautiful location drawings, <em>A Drifting
Life</em> poses the great questions of comic book art: What are you looking
at? What do you see?

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/

041509_adriftinglife04-300x239.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="239" /></a>

	I have no doubt that I will return to <em>A Drifting Life</em> or that I
will seek out more of Tatsumi's work. In the mean time, I am devouring
Mitsuru Adachi's <em>Cross Game</em>, getting into the manga groove.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[The protagonists in
comicbooks, be they extra-terrestrial or earthly, are losers. They’re losers
in the social sense (social, sexual, scientific misfits who wear the wrong
things and look awkward in every social situation one could imagine), in the
literal sense (they “lose” things like parents, friends, lovers), and in the
figurative sense (nearly every comicbook plotline revolves around the
recovery, however futile, of whatever has been lost). It’s as if the emphasis
on a protagonist’s “loserness”—emotionally, figuratively, literally—is a
necessity.

	<!--more-->

	One way to confront the comicbook’s “loser mode” is to look at how comics
are  understood in a broader cultural context. For instance, most of us learn
to read by looking at picture books, which usually borrow (or did they
invent?) the narrative structure that juxtaposes words and images to create
movement across the page common to comics. From the initial contact with
words onwards, we’re always looking for pictures that illustrate the text.

	<a

He_teeters_and_totters_w800Frame.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium

He_teeters_and_totters_w800Frame-300x225.jpg" alt="Jez Alborough - SuperDuck"
width="300" height="225" /></a>

	There’s no great interest in the idea that we confront the written word
with graphics from the beginning (if you are interested, check out Derrida),
or that we conjure images in our minds when we read. What’s interesting is
how those representations—the images that go with the words—are often of
losers, right from the beginning. Some of you might have read something by
these two:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Spot.jpg"><
img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-743" title="Dick and Jane"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Spot-300x206.
jpg" alt="Dick and Jane" width="300" height="206" /></a>

	Without doubt the most roundly mocked couple in the history of reading.
They’re losers in the strictest and cruelest sense. There’s nothing exciting
about <em>Dick and Jane,</em> unless you want to let your <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2011/08/16/36-pornography-and-comics/">
interpretation make it interesting</a>. Take the beloved Dr. Zuess as another
example:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-
2011-09-12-at-10.43.43-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium
wp-image-741" title="Cat in ther Hat"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-
2011-09-12-at-10.43.43-AM-222x300.png" alt="Cat in the Hat" width="222"
height="300" /></a>

	Sally and “Me” are incapable of making fun for themselves: losers.
They’re left alone in the house all day with a fish to look after them and
they cannot think of anything to do. Really? If Sally has enough panache to
request or tie that red bow in her hair, surely she could produce the illicit
machinations common to children left alone in the house. And, how maniacally
needy is that cat in the hat? He’s the loser in the class who keeps raising
his hand shouting, “look at me, look at me now, look what I can do!”

	To some degree, all our early confrontations with image and text are
through representations of losers; and it only gets worse. Soon, we’re hit
with Superman, Batman, and Spider-man; all social misfits, perennial losers
who happen to have a super power, which, in the irony of ironies, they cannot
disclose to anyone and thus lose a good many things. Then come the more
“realistic” comicbooks: the Jimmy Corrigan, Bruce Bechdel, Art Spiegelman in
<em>Maus</em>, Seth in<em> It’s a Good Life if You Don’t Weaken</em>, Chester
Brown in <em>Paying for It</em>. All losers in the multifarious definition
noted above.

	Along with the reading of the comics are the individuals we must purchase
them from. There is no flattering representation of comicbook store owners in
popular culture. Indeed, the most famous of all is frequently imitated by
those wishing to convey someone else’s idiocy or “loserdom”:

	<a href="http://www.austinpost.org/content/nerds-summer"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-745" title="comic_book_guy"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/comic_book_guy
-300x300.jpg" alt="Comic Store Guy" width="300" height="300" /></a>

	Wade “Superboy” Adams in Season 3 of <em>Sex and the City</em> is another
classic representation of the comicbook store owner. The title, “Hot Child in
the City,” is a clue we don’t even need as we watch this man-child woo Carrie
to his parent’s home wherein he still maintains a bedroom and dime-bag. Again
and again, comics and their consumption is associated with losers.

	<div style="text-align:center"> <iframe width="420" height="345"
src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rMouApioqHc" frameborder="0"
allowfullscreen></iframe> </div style>

	But all is not lost, we’re just in a rut (coincidentally, the narrative
continuity of comics, endlessly replaying the same plotline means that losers
are always in a rut, always losers; they don’t even get to grow). When we
look at how comics are positioned in popular culture, we see that they exude
a calming effect. They almost manage the potential risk of figures who read
them, like when Elvis Presley reads a comic book:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Elvis-reads-a
-comic-book.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-739"
title="Elvis reads a comic book"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Elvis-reads-a-
comic-book-239x300.jpg" alt="Elvis Reads a Comic Book" width="239"
height="300" /></a>

	At first glance, Presely’s preoccupation with the comic book reinforces
his boyish innocence (one is reminded of Presley referring to everyone
politely as “ma’am” or “sir”) and takes away from the sexual anxieties he
aroused. The comic seems to present Presley as less threatening, naive, and
to some extent unaware of his sexual prowess. That said, his reading of the
comic book also connects him to a more illicit cultural production, one not
bound by “literary” expectations or canonical learning—popular culture will
do just fine for The King. Presely’s relaxed demeanour, and low tastes in
reading material, work to reinforce anxieties about his corrupt, wiggling,
gyrations, and what they do to all his female fans.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/
Bluesbreakers_John_Mayall_with_Eric_Clapton.jpg"><img class="aligncenter
size-medium wp-image-737" title="Bluesbreakers_John_Mayall_with_Eric_Clapton"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/
Bluesbreakers_John_Mayall_with_Eric_Clapton-300x300.jpg" alt="The Beano
Album" width="300" height="300" /></a>

	The association of comics with illicit behaviour or taboo-breaking has a
long history. Eric Clapton, whose string bending, distorted, impassioned
guitar playing was the genesis for a slew of “guitar gods,” holds a
<em>Beano</em> comic book in the iconic Bluesbreakers album cover often
referred to as “The Beano Album.” The <em>Beano</em> was a serial anthology
in the UK that featured mischief-makers such as Dennis the Menace (the
crueller British version) and Minnie the Minx (who was “wild as wild can
be”). Robert Crumb’s first taste of popular acclaim arguably arrived with his
album-cover work on Cheap Thrills, the Big Brother and the Holding Company
album that introduced Janis Joplin to the world. Just as Eric Clapton reading
a <em>Beano</em> comic signals his own string bending feedback roar against
the placid guitar playing of the era, Crumb's album cover signaled the
arrival of Joplin's unique vocal growl and unconventional rockstar
femininity.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Cheapthrills.
jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-738" title="Cheapthrills"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Cheapthrills-
300x300.jpg" alt="CheapThrills" width="300" height="300" /></a>

	And so it goes, both losers and innovators. What comics show us is that
the disenfranchised, the losers of the world, are the ones who tend to
innovative and bring about change, the ones who possess that latent super
power that will flourish. That's a powerful lesson; one that makes up for all
the crappy representations of people associated with comicbooks in popular
culture. That said, maybe we like rooting for losers because it's how we
first confront the word. And, given that we first confront the word through
the interplay of text and image, the association of the comicbook with the
loser is simply inked into the guttered page; not something unique to the
subject matter and protagonists common to comics and image/text
representations, but to the very act(ion) of reading them.

	Finally, a bankshot: it’s no accident that all the calming of
illicitness—or incitement of it—comes when a man reads—or sells—a comicbook.
For women, the comicbook is something forbidden; it’s where boys go, and
girls should proceed with the utmost of caution (note Carrie's clueless
assumptions about comicbooks in the above Sex and The City video: "aren't
comics a boy thing?"). Thankfully, many women do proceed without caution and
thrive, bringing much needed perspective to the genre. However, that Marylin
Monroe is pictured below reading James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> tells us
something about the representation of "literariness" works in popular
culture, and how it can be subverted the same way comicbooks and the
associations they conjure represent the act of reading and the expectations
that go with that act.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/
54175261_1d021e96a6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-736"
title="Marilyn Monroe Reads Ulysses"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/
54175261_1d021e96a6-209x300.jpg" alt="Marilyn Monroe Reads Ulysses"
width="209" height="300" /></a>

	The picture above, we can only assume, is supposed to make Monroe look
smart. I.e.: she’s not just a dumb blonde; she’s got academic literary chops
and she's "high-minded" and "well read"; the perfect attractive, but socially
safe, wife. And for some, the photo might temper Monroe’s sexuality and make
her seem more intelligent than she comes off singing "<a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3IzpazVl-I" target="_blank">Happy
Birthday</a>" to President Kennedy. But then, there’s this perspective, and
all is lost:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/
eve_arnold__marilyn_monroe_lit_ulysse02_4011.jpg"><img class="aligncenter
size-medium wp-image-740" title="Marylin Monroe Reads Ulysses_2"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/
eve_arnold__marilyn_monroe_lit_ulysse02_4011-228x300.jpg" alt="Marilyn Monroe
Reads Ulysses_2" width="228" height="300" /></a>

	What’s really interesting about both these pictures is left to the losers
of the world who have actually read <em>Ulysses</em>—itself a book full of
losers. The careful observer will note that Monroe illicitly confirms her
carnal potential by opening the book to its back pages and Molly Bloom’s
protracted and empowering dialogue: “then I asked him with my eyes to ask
again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and
first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel
my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said
yes I will Yes” (Joyce <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4300">1</a>).
So, perhaps, women reading literature is as subversive, potentially
innovative and carnival as men reading comicbooks.]]></content:encoded>

	So I started off my Adventures with Tintin (see what I did there?)
feeling very very very confused and largely irritable.  This wasn't my first
foray into Tintin; I read through them all when I was a kid because our
public library had the whole set and because he seemed pretty neat.  But when
you're 10, your suspension of disbelief is not only willing, but joyful.  You
don't need a lot of back story to be satisfied with the plot as it unfolds.
 Because Tintin doesn't offer a lot of backstory.  People are chasing him...
because they are.  He's a journalist... who never puts pen to paper.  He
seems to be in constant peril and yet never comes to harm.  But why?  I kept
asking myself as I moved through title after title: what is going on, and why
is it happening?

	Then I came to a startling realization that I was a victim of my own
expectations of genre.  Because of the way the books look, the set up of
Tintin as an ordinary, unassuming reporter, the adventure narratives and the
real life (if filtered) scenarios, I was expecting if not a slice-of-life
comic, then something of a straightforward realist narrative.  Such stories
usually offer rich backstory and straightforward cause and effect.  (Except
when they don't.)  But that's not what Tintin is.

	Tintin is a superhero, and these books are superhero comics.

	Slide into some tights and I'll explain.

	You know what you never really expect of a superhero story?  Rationality
and explanation.  Superhero stories mostly just get to be what they are.
 Really?  A radioactive spider?  Okay!  You're from the Planet Krypton?
 Sure!  You can fly?  Why not?  In fact, that question is the central
difference between a superhero comic and a realist narrative; when we read
texts with the expectation that they exist in our world and function by our
rules, we ask why.  When we read a superhero comic, we ask why not.

	There are lots of things that make Tintin a superhero. <ul> <li>sidekick
(Snowy) who provides comic relief and gets him into and out of scrapes</li>
<li>invincibility (seriously, nothing kills this guy)</li> <li>a
mild-mannered outward appearance (though not a secret identity)</li> <li>a
job -- reporter -- that he NEVER EVER DOES</li> <li>strength, cunning, and
honour</li> <li>an excellent lead hook</li> </ul> Once upon a time, Chris
Sims created <a
href="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.comicsalliance.com/media/2010/05/
periodictable-2.jpg">the Elements of a Superhero</a>, and I think there's an
argument to be made that Tintin embodies elements 1, 4, 7, 11, 29, 30, 45,
47, 54, and 71.  For example...

	Invincibility (with superheroic sound effects!):

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/photo-1.jpg">
<img class="size-full wp-image-981 alignnone" title="photo 1"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/photo-1.jpg"
alt="" width="710" height="717" /></a>

	Also, the comical black-and-white nature of good and evil in the villains
echo those of Jack Kirby-era comics:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/photo-4.jpg">
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-982" title="photo 4"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/photo-4.jpg"
alt="" width="263" height="235" /></a>

	And the amazingly unperilous peril (seriously, there is at least one
panel like this one in every Tintin comic ever):

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/photo-2.jpg">
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-983" title="photo 2"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/photo-2.jpg"
alt="" width="171" height="242" /></a> (don't worry too much -- he figures it
out EVERY SINGLE TIME)

	See, when I was reading the comics as even vague representations of
realism, they were infuriating.  Once I accepted that Tintin is a superhero,
and thus the laws applying to you and I do not apply to him, I was able to
relax into the ridiculous scenarios and enjoy the ride.  He has to be a
superhero for the framing and conceit to work.

	This is the power of the expectations we have around genre, and a
reminder of how much the assumptions we bring to a text shape our
understanding of it.

	But I still think Tintin should wear tights.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[A few things: this post
is about the first <em>Tintin</em> adventure serialized starting on January
10, 1929. The collected serial has come to us English readers, and in
subsequent French editions, in black and white only because Hergé did not go
back and redo the storyline for a collected, colour, edition as he did for
his other <em>Tintin</em> stories. With the these bibliographic details out
of the way, let’s dive into why I think this book is important as an artifact
of the modernist movement in the arts; an aesthetic, cultural, and social
movement that took hold in the early part of the twentieth century,
particularly the year 1922 when James Joyce published <em>Ulysses</em>, T. S.
Eliot let fly with <em>The Waste Land</em>, and Virginia Woolf gave us the
poetic prose of <em>Jacob’s Room</em>.

	<!--more-->

	Modernism, to put it excessively crudely and generally, can be broken
down into three main features: 1) aesthetic experimentation with ways of
representing the relationship between form and subject, 2) an outlook on
modern life that grapples with the emergence of new technologies,
consumerism, and popular (mass) culture, 3) a renewed social awareness that
tended to foster both pessimism and optimism, depending on the context; the
world was either nearing its end, or on the precipice of its zenith. Perhaps
the most profound result of all these features collapsing around a single
focus is a tendency to understand the era as fraught with terrors and
self-realizations that could not be represented or reconciled, where
everything seemed to be fracturing, causing a divide between past and
present, reality and perception, that would never be traversed. The subjects
of modernity are marked by upheaval and confusion, and the experience of it
must be captured as such, as a kind of decent into the maelstrom.

	At first blush, the presence of an aesthetic principle that attempts to
reconcile or represent the tremors of modern life is completely absent from
Hergé’s story about a boy-reporter and his dog. <em>Tintin in the Land of the
Soviets</em> is notable if only because it is essentially a Western
propaganda vehicle for revealing Soviet propaganda--the proverbial black
kettle. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/
sovietsecrets2.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1025"
title="sovietsecrets2"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/sovietsecrets2
.jpeg" alt="" width="367" height="475" /></a></p>  The sequencing of
<em>Tintin in the Land of the Soviets</em> is hard to follow. The narrative
is loosely strung together and when read in a collected edition rather than
as a serial, it seems fractured, haphazard and unstructured. The episodic
plotting of the collected edition mimics the vaudeville show with its
repeated gags and zippy one-liners; it keeps the audience engaged through its
cyclical momentum but doesn’t leave much room for drama, mystery or character
development. That said, for all its faults, the book does one thing really
well: it consistently locates Tintin in this fractured, frantically-paced,
disparate world in which he finds himself. And, its episodic plot would seem
to mimic the frenetic pace of modern life where one perception is immediately
followed by another perception, and where the <em>deus ex machina</em> that
comes to the rescue is decidedly technological. <p style="text-align:
center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/phonograph.
png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1022" title="phonograph"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/phonograph.png
" alt="" width="188" height="183" /></a></p> Hergé spends a good deal of
aesthetic capital revealing the instances of Soviet corruption and ineptitude
at the expense of telling a good story. In fact, one could argue that unlike
most other Tintin adventures, there is no story here. Instead, we have a
series of episodes that rely on a similarity of subject—the land of the
soviets—for their cohesion, and there’s not much of that either. Tintin’s
first run-in with undue authoritarianism actually happens in Berlin during
the book’s first 10 pages, not at the hands of the unreasonable Soviets.

	In short, it would be a big stretch to assume that Hergé is really doing
anything interesting with the story in terms of metaphoric layering, or even
when it comes to the most surface of declarations about the realities of the
Soviet system. That said, what the Soviet system does provide is a metaphor
for the fractured, unfamiliar experience of modern life. Tintin
metaphorically journeys up the river and into the heart of darkness where
strangeness and otherness exist in their natural state. The opportunity
afforded by this journey into the heart of darkness allows Herge to draw upon
some of the experiential challenges of modern life while at the same time
providing stability for one’s experience of it. Tintin navigates his way
through the technological world with aplomb and resurfaces again and again
with the affirmative “here I am.” <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hereiam.png">
<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1017" title="hereiam"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hereiam.png"
alt="" width="180" height="176" /></a></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hereiamgood.
png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1018" title="hereiamgood"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hereiamgood.
png" alt="" width="177" height="176" /></a></p> Along with his repetition of
“here I am,”  Tintin persistently visually signals “here I am” when he
addresses the audience directly offering a moment of reflection and stability
in the otherwise amped-up madcap journey through Soviet Russia. The
sequential pace also slows when Tintin is the detached observer of the
struggling Soviet state, hands clasped behind his back he comments and
observes rather than participates, slowing things down, suggesting a
psychological inertia that allows him to comprehend his environment rather
than merely experience it.

	Hergé seems to reconcile the onset of technological experience with the
medium itself. He offers an intriguing play on the comic gutter (and the
fourth wall) when he shows Tintin fighting off a group of would-be attackers
entering his room. He exploits the comic's framed page to interesting effect
(the gutter is both a figurative door to the unseen activities between
actions and a division between the different "rooms" where action takes
place), but at the same time Hergé uses the dividing line—or gutter—between
the characters and their respective ideologies. <p style="text-align:
center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/slipt-screen.
jpeg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1023" title="slipt-screen"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/slipt-screen.
jpeg" alt="" width="367" height="475" /></a></p> Hergé’s episodic plot seems
ideally suited to jumping over the space between panels, leaping the gutters
without regard for narrative structure much as Eliot shifts from voices, to
Sanskrit, to noises, to myth in <em>The Waste Land</em> without the
traditional markers of formal narrative development. At the same time, the
props that keep the journey in the story moving are technological. He
journeys not by horse (he tries to, but the horse throws him off), or by
sled, but by cars, a train, a boat, a diving suit, and a plane. For all its
failings, the Soviet state is not bereft of the technological (and
mechanical) marvels that supposedly instigate the fractured environment in
which modernism situates itself; the fractured environment in which
experiences seem to be other worldly, perception thrown out of whack,
certainties uncertain. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/boat2car.jpeg
"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1013" title="boat2car"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/boat2car.jpeg"
alt="" width="367" height="475" /></a></p> In fact, the dominate metaphor of
Tintin’s exploration—and I use that term "exploration" lightly—is a
commentary about how technologies offer a way out of the “other world”; a way
of escaping a strange, perceptively different, world. It even suggests that
some of the technological marvels of mass production (with their constantly
leaky petrol) and endless productivity may well be a sham—it wasn’t only the
Soviets selling the idea of infinite progress in 1929. <p style="text-align:
center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/handyman.jpeg
"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1016" title="handyman"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/handyman.jpeg"
alt="" width="367" height="475" /></a></p> Perhaps the most optimistic
takeaway from <em>Tintin in the Land of the Soviets</em> is that serendipity
is always present—there is always a plan, it just hasn’t been discovered yet.
Nothing is actually haphazard, it just appears that way. Tintin, introduced
as he is for the first time in this comic sequence foregrounding his
encounter with the Soviet state, is the quintessential modern figure:
satiric, adventurous, mechanically inclined. Above all, however, he never
thinks too much about reconciling his current perceptions with traditional
perceptions. He simply pushes forward, recovering, discovering, existing in
the serendipity of the moment in which he finds himself. Through it all,
Tintin offers what is perhaps the most salient comment about locating oneself
in the constantly shifting, fractured, environment of the early twentieth
century: “here I am.” <p style="text-align: center;"><a

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have to admit that I
wasn’t too familiar with Tintin before we agreed to work with Herge’s (or,
more correctly, Georges Remi’s) texts on Graphixia, beyond the general “story
of a boy and his dog” motif. These young adult texts, notoriously popular in
Europe and the world over, however, have a diverse readership have been
translated into what is apparently every language known to man (including –
holy snakes – Latin!) and number to date more than 200 million copies of the
twenty-four titles of the Tintin graphic novels worldwide, with the upcoming
movie likely adding greatly to that already substantial figure. Given that
Tintin seems to be so widely celebrated in such a cross cultural way, to what
can we attribute this overwhelming success? Is there something Platonic about
the material that speaks to coming of age that condenses the nuances of
cultural experience? What is it about Herge’s formula that can account for
the incredible staying power of a character who at first appears like a
typical do-gooder teen? Interestingly, and as our previous week’s post noted,
the answer may lie in some of the many tropes that the typical superhero
comic book follows as well.

	Tintin, a young newspaper report<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/tintin7.jpg">
<img class="alignleft  wp-image-1280"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/tintin7-
300x225.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="211" /></a>er, has a nose for trouble
that always seems to stem from a desire to do good and correct inequities
that he sees in the world, from ensuring that a celebrated astronomer gets
his due for a groundbreaking discovery to foiling criminal schemes in the
forging of currency. This, however, is only where the texts begin – Tintin
appears in the right (or wrong) place at the right (or wrong) time, and it is
his compulsion for both justice and mystery that acts as the catalyst for the
adventure that follows. These adventures typically follow a byzantine tangle
of subplots reminiscent of the most popular of Victorian literature which
often lead to nowhere, with action that is fast paced and, at times, almost
frenetic. Because of this, the texts can sometimes be difficult to follow, as
they incorporate random asides of vaudevillian slapstick and peripheral
information to keep the readers’ interest – this style of storytelling is
hardly surprising, given Tintin’s original format of the newspaper serial
which required consistent cliffhangers in order to keep readers coming back
for more. We can see the same style in modern graphic novels that collect
comics that were originally published serially, with overly suspenseful
moments coming consistently at every twenty-two pages like clockwork. Though
these cliffhangers compel readers, however, it is more likely the larger
pedagogical and thematic elements of Tintin that contribute to its success.

	The strength of Tintin, arguably at first glance blasé, static and
predictably noble character in and of himself, comes from the failure of the
outside social environment in protecting a worldview based on justice and
adherence to a moral order. The authorities in Tintin are not only repeatedly
bumbling, but<a

><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1282"

Tintin’s own investigations, aligning the reader with the protagonist and
against the “authorities” through recognition of the desire for corrective
measures regarding society’s more properly acknowledged guardians of justice.
It is this recognition that drives both Tintin as well as mainstream
superhero comics, as it was really the cause for the advent of the superhero
on the whole: the rise of an individual, inherent sense of morality that is
required to offset the frequent ineptitude of those we rely on to run society
for us. As can be seen in the Tintin adventure “The Black Island,” often
whole pages are devoted to highlighting the incompetence of police officers,
firemen and those we would put our faith in to ensure that moral order is
being maintained. Trapped inside a burning building, Herge draws attention to
the events outside of the structure as the authorities fumble about trying to
find its key, risking Tintin's life as he lies unconscious inside. <a

300x100.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="100" /></a>Tintin is successful in
spite of these characters, and one could claim that it is knowledge of their
inevitable failure that compels him to action in the first place.

	There are, of course, many other factors that make The Adventures of
Tintin exciting reads, such as the exotic locales that he ventures to, the
exploration of others’ cultural values, the thrill of multiple adventures
contained within a single text. There are also aspects of Herge’s opus that
invite scholarship on an academic level, from noting the postcolonial
undertones that run throughout, to the sense of noblesse oblige that
underlies the apparently moneyed Tintin as he spends a fortune in seeing that
wrongs are righted. Underpinning all of these, however, lies the superhero’s
impetus for action that draws from the failings of the world to live up to
the greater expectations of the moral individual, and as a teaching tool,
Tintin forces the young reader to call into question the omnipotence of the
various authorities that would guide the collective hand of society both
legally and morally. Tintin can be applauded most, however, in the
significant way that he actually differs from the classic superhero text, in
that he does not have a secret identity that he returns to after he
continuously saves the day – he makes the right choices at a cost to his
personal safety and his reputation as the authorities consistently label him
a troublemaker and often a criminal himself as they misconstrue his actions.
One might call Tintin a true hero in this regard, even more than a Superman
or a Batman, as he struggles for the collective and individual good with the
whole of his being, unperturbed how these actions will appear to others and
without the safety net of an alternate identity to retreat into when things
go awry. Despite the social conventions (and those figures put in place to
uphold them) that limit truth and justice that get in his way, Tintin proves
himself to be the kind of modern hero who questions authority in pursuit of
what he sees as the greater good.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA["Death is the sanction
of everything that the storyteller can tell" -- Walter Benjamin (qtd. in
Brooks 22)

	&nbsp;

	In <em>Reading for the Plot</em>, Peter Brooks writes:

	&nbsp; <blockquote>Perhaps it would be best to speak of the anticipation
of retrospection as our chief tool in making sense of narrative, the master
trope of its strange logic. We have no doubt foregone eternal narrative ends,
and even traditional nineteenth-century ends are subject to self-conscious
endgames, yet still we read in the spirit of confidence, and also a state of
dependence, that what remains to be read will restructure the provisional
readings of the already read (23).</blockquote> &nbsp;

	Norwegian comics artist Jason's <em>Hey, Wait...</em> certainly
“restructures the provisional readings of the already read” : what initially
appears as childhood nostalgia transforms into a more poignant loss, as Jason
organizes  <em>Hey, Wait...</em> around the death of Bjorn, the main
character’s best friend. This death not only affects what comes after
it--Jon’s loneliness, alcoholism and failure--but restructures what comes
before it: our readerly identification with Jon’s childhood invokes our own
memories, whose sweetness Bjorn’s death obliterates because his death is the
death of childhood itself, and a reminder that nostalgia for youth is
constituted by the horizon of death.

	&nbsp;

	All the earmarks of a boy's childhood in the 1970s appear in the first
half as Jon and Bjorn tread the fine line between boredom and idyll. John
draws  pictures of Batman when his lessons get dull. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Batman.jpg"><
img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1299" title="Batman"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Batman.jpg"
alt="" width="1481" height="803" /></a>He is attracted to a girl, Ingrid, but
is deathly afraid of speaking to her. He and Bjorn talk about a guy who has
"done it," try to decide what to do on long summer days, and perform various
pranks. And yet, Jason manages to avoid cliche by dislocating reality; this
is a world in which humanoid dogs and birds are the main actors, where pairs
of wooden stilts replace cars, and pterodactyls snatch kites from the air. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Drive.jpg"><
img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1302" title="Drive"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Drive.jpg"
alt="" width="714" height="377" /></a>This deviation from realism renders
nostalgia familiar but strange: uncanny. This uncanniness extends to the
figure of Death, who appears in the first half as a schoolyard bully and as a
passing cyclist who waves at Jon. We don’t know that he is Death until we
read the second part. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Death.jpg"><
img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1305" title="Death"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Death.jpg"
alt="" width="713" height="371" /></a>He appears ragged and skull-like, but
because we are already in this slightly distorted world, we don’t necessarily
make the connection until his role becomes more obvious.

	&nbsp;

	<em>Hey, Wait...</em> is one of a long line of non-superhero comics that
reflects on its relationship to that genre. Bjorn’s death emerges in the gap
between the superhero's world and mundane reality; it results from Jon
suggesting that they ought to create a Batman club. This club would require a
test for membership: leaping up to and swinging from a branch above a cliff
to prove one’s courage. Jon illustrates the test without difficulty. While
Bjorn initially demurs, he screws up his courage for another day. Alas, he
fails where Jon succeeds and falls to his death. Bjorn’s death also kills
Batman and all that Batman represents for Jon and maybe for us; the escapism
of that comic book world is no longer possible.

	&nbsp;

	The second part jumps many years forward in Jon’s life. He lives on his
own in an apartment. He has a child but appears to be separated, if not
divorced, from his wife. Adulthood for him is all drudgery--his job is to
drill holes in cubes--regret, and remorse. His adulthood betrays his
childhood. In part one Bjorn and Jon spend a summer's day discussing what
they will do with their adult lives: “One thing’s for sure,” Bjorn notes,
“I’m not gonna work in a factory or someplace boring like that.” “Nope,” Jon
responds. For Jon, the transition from part one to part two is one from a
world where everything seems possible to one where nothing seems possible--a
world stripped of its Batmanness. The post-Batman world restructures the
meaning of Jon's innocent childhood doodles. We reinterpret our initial
response to them as they become weighty portents of  a future where they have
no place.

	&nbsp;

	If Chris Ware’s <em>Jimmy Corrigan: the Smartest Kid on Earth</em> is
about how superheroes plague comics, about how we can’t get rid of them even
though they do not serve any useful purpose, <em>Hey, Wait...</em> both
implicates Batman in Bjorn’s death and mourns his passing as a kind of
collateral damage. Batman becomes part of a memory that death converts from
sweet to sublime--unthinkable and unrepresentable. The only way to indicate
this sublimity is with the full page of six blacked-out panels that appear
immediately after Bjorn makes his jump. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Black.jpg"><
img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1308" title="Black"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Black.jpg"
alt="" width="710" height="379" /></a> In the second half of the book we see
a corresponding page of white panels when Jon gets drunk. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/White.jpg"><
img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1309" title="White"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/White.jpg"
alt="" width="687" height="378" /></a>The braiding of the two pages
establishes the text’s relationship to memory: first a blackout and then a
whiteout. These two pages may be the most important in the book, yet there is
"nothing" on either of them. The black panels indicate the end of a world.
The white panels show the irony of that world’s continuance in memory and
Jon’s inability to erase it except through dying himself: the final page
shows him boarding a bus full of the dead.

	&nbsp;

	While boarding that bus provides a form of closure for Jon, we readers of
<em>Hey, Wait...</em> remain caught in a kind of limbo between the two halves
of the book...as if we have been tricked. We thought we were getting one kind
of story--a childhood idyll--but ended up with another--a story of adult
misery. Our suspension gives the book’s title its full meaning. Jon utters
the phrase as Bjorn leaps for the branch that ought to confer upon him
membership in the Batman club. We can even imagine that the phrase itself
causes Bjorn to miss the branch, as it interrupts and throws off his leap.
But we keep saying “Hey, Wait...” to ourselves, to the book, and to life
itself well after Bjorn has died, because “Hey, Wait...” is not simply a call
for someone else to pause; it is a sign of missing something and then getting
it--a joke that one doesn’t quite understand the punchline to starts to
become clear.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I read this book today in Norwegian. It was
beautiful but so very sad and troubling that I wanted to find out what other
people thought. I found this article really helpful in framing my own
reading.

	Isn't there also a suggestion towards the end of the book that Jon wanted
Bjørn to fall? That's why he said those words just as Bjørn was going to
jump, in order to throw him off. Then later when Jon says to Death, "I could
understand [my life turning out this way] it if I were a bad person, but I'm
not," and Death just stares at him, there is a question about what kind of
person Jon really is. Perhaps he is a bad person, perhaps he did a bad thing,
but he tries not to remember it that way.

	The first part of the book is filtered through the mind of the adult Jon.
When he goes back to his town at the end of the book and sees himself playing
football with Bjørn, their relationship is different from how he remembers it
in the first part. Bjørn beats Jon easily and Jon appears to be angry. Maybe
this is the dynamic between them that led to Jon tricking his friend into
falling, and it's this that memory has blotted out. It's only when he can
finally look at this truth that he is ready to board the bus.

	In this respect, the figure of Death is also an aspect of Jon that he
doesn't want to recognise. This is why, although the figure is antagonistic
when they first meet, once Jon has set up the idea of the Batman club and the
entry test, the Death figure smiles at him on his way by.

	At the end Jon acknowledges and takes his rightful place amongst those
figures who resemble the Death figure. He has always been amongst them, he
just didn't want to see it.

	That's where I'm at with it now.]]></wp:comment_content>

	Superman comics are my kryptonite.

	See what I did there?

	Usually I don't love Superman.  He's too perfect.  It's annoying.  I like
my superheroes flawed and fallible.  But, I also like alternate histories, so
I was eager to dig in to <em>Superman: Red Son</em>.  I enjoy playing in the
possibilities of what-if and what-might-have-been.  One of the things I love
about the established characters in the DC and Marvel universe is that
because their (albeit fictional, I guess) history is well known and accepted,
alternate histories are, of course, a common place to play with storylines.

	Ultimately, alternate history depends on memory.  If you don't or can't
recollect the narrative that the alternative history is "riffing" on, you
can't make sense of the purpose of the retelling.  It stops being an
alternate history and starts being, like, I don't know.  A story.  And you
can get a story any old damn place.  Alternate history is special.

	DC has an imprint devoted to alternate history.  They call it Elseworlds,
which is a great friggin' name.  <em>Superman: Red Son</em> is part of this
imprint; it's a three-issue one-shot (that can't be the right word for this)
by Mark Millar with art by Dave Johnson, Killian Plunkett, Andrew Robinson,
and Walden Wong.  The premise is pretty straightforward: what if Superman's
capsule had crashed not in Kansas, but in the Ukraine under Soviet rule?
 Superman is no longer the protector of the American Way, but instead a
figure devoted to the goals of Stalinist communism and committed to
globalizing the Soviet Union.  If your first response to that idea was OH
SNAP, then your first response was correct.  Oh snap, indeed.

	(It's awesome is what I'm saying.)

	Also, you know it's an alternate history because Green Lantern becomes
the hope for mankind.  I mean, seriously.  Please never let that happen,
universe.

	Okay, but I was supposed to talk about memory (1).  As I mentioned,
alternate history, if it works, is predicated on memory, and that's certainly
true here.  It's only unsettling to consider Superman in Stalin's hands if
you have some framework for understanding both those concepts in their
accepted historical context.  On a macro level, the whole thing collapse if
your memory fails you.  On a micro level, these alternate histories within
established comic world only work if you're versed in the lore.  Lois Luthor
only makes your heart sink, and CIA operative Jimmy Olsen only delights you,
if you know the backstory.  When Superman, in a quest for a utopia, turns the
Soviet people into an unthinking and incapable mass, a reader without the
proper framework might see this as a case of a character overreaching in
support of his ideals.  Superman fans, though, know that this is a perversion
of the values Superman has stood for.  Without that backstory, Superman's
climactic exit makes no sense.  For Marvel and DC, alternate histories are
gifts to the hardcore fans, a way of demonstrating that the amount of
intellectual energy they (fine, we) spend on keeping track of the characters
has been worthwhile.

	It's a reward for the committed reader's extended dedication to memory.

	Because I was thinking about how memory frames and drives these kinds of
stories, I was interested to see the extent to which memory is the motivating
force in the actions the characters take.  Not Superman, so much, as he is
motivated by his ideals.  But Batman, in this version, is motivated to
destroy Superman (2) because his parents were killed by the head of the KGB;
the memory of the night of their murder haunts him and leads him to seek to
destroy Superman as a representative of that regime.  Lois Lane, trapped in a
SURPRISE unhappy marriage to Lex Luthor, is haunted by the memory of
Superman's face; even as she believes her government's propaganda about
commie Superman, she finds it hard to release these feelings and it shapes
her response to him at the end of the text.  Wonder Woman, betrayed by
Superman, is motivated by the echoing memory of that betrayal to help attempt
to destroy Superman.  And visually, we're alerted to the importance of all
these (and other) moments of memory through the use of a chiaroscuro fog
effect in the panels -- we revisit the scenes visually at significant moments
where memory becomes a motivator.  It's a little frying-pan-over-the-head
once you start looking for it, but it works.

	Memory is important to <em>Superman: Red Son</em> both in content and
form.  And the cool thing about alternate histories is that the reader's
memory of the alternate history itself shapes the reading of future "normal"
history comics in the series.  The interaction is fluid and variable, as
anything based in memory is wont to be.

	Just don't think too hard about the end of <em>Superman: Red Son
</em>(3).

	Endnotes:

	(1) If, when you read my posts, you get the feeling that I'm the adorable
but slightly less intellectually fortunate member of this ensemble cast,
you're not wrong.  If Graphixia was <em>Friends</em>, I would be a literate
Joey.  Which is just Phoebe I guess.  I don't know, I haven't seen the show
in a decade.  OMG, me, stop typing!

	(2) For women who dig superheroes, this matchup is akin to that scene in
<em>Bridget Jones' Diary</em> where Colin Firth and Hugh Grant fight each
other.  Hashtag fantastic.

	(3) <strong>Don't read this until you've read the comic.</strong> What do
we do with the fact that Millar sets us up for a repeat and the entire plot
becomes cyclical?  Lois Lane and Lex Luthor become Superman's ancestors,
right?  Like, his great-great-great-to-the-power-of-a-lot grandparents?  So
Superman is hot for Grandma Lois?  I TOLD YOU NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT TOO MUCH.
 You can't unthink these thoughts!

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Firstly: great post. You raise an important
point about the function of memory in alternate history comics.

	Similarly the 1990s X-Men: Age of Apocalypse 'saga' doesn't work if you
aren't well versed in the lore of Claremont's decade-spanning stewardship on
the 'core' X-titles.

	Red Son is a cracker of a book though. Millar really knocked it out of
the park (and as you touched upon the art is superb and sets the tone
beautifully). It's great to see how someone with intentions as noble and
genuinely good as Superman's can lead to completely different conclusion if
raised according to Soviet principles instead of the 'American Way'. Also, on
a personal note, seeing Supes tear the entire Green Lantern Corps to shreds
in the space of about three panels was priceless.

	As for the end: I loved it but thought it might annoy more devoted
Superman fans than myself (I hadn't read Super-books since childhood and only
returned for Red Son and Morisson's Action Comics) but from what I know of
Millar it seems like he can't help but poke the controversy-bear with his
writing stick.]]></wp:comment_content>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Superhero comics remind
us about things we’ve missed in a story or things we may not have context to
understand through editorial interjections, or annotations. Those little
boxes, usually at the bottom of a panel, indicated by a "*" and often signed
“Eds” or "The Editors," help us make sense of something happening in a story
that relates to a previous event that we might not remember or that we missed
because we never read the issue. They help us work out the continuity of
on-going story-lines or, more often, the explanation being offered by a
character in response to an event the “Eds” remind us of. The interesting
part about these editorial interjections isn’t that they exist, but that they
almost always refer us back to another issue. They don’t “tell” us anything.
Instead, they point us in the right direction, essentially allowing us to
cross-reference and find out why a character is saying or doing what s/he is
doing.

	[*Here’s a great article about these <a
href="http://ifanboy.com/articles/being-perfectly-clear-how-extra-information
-can-enhance-the-comic-experience/" target="_blank">editorial
annotations</a>. Eds.]

	By foregrounding the action of going back to an earlier issue, the
editors prioritize the act of re-reading (or filling in for new readers)
rather than remembering. We are not so much reminded as redirected to another
issue. The gambit is this: the editors don’t want us to actually remember
what happened in earlier issues. In fact, they assume we won’t remember and
will need to go back and read the previous story (again, maybe) to understand
the impetus for a character action or claim. <p style="text-align:
center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/
ASM001_03_snippet.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1338"
title="ASM001_03_snippet"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/
ASM001_03_snippet.jpg" alt="" width="262" height="66" /></a></p> The
narrative and story (yes, both) in comics function on a principle of not
remembering. Even characters don’t usually remember what they did in previous
issues unless it’s a continued storyline or story arc. The act of a character
referring to something in the past by remembering is so unique that an editor
often needs to interject to remind the reader where this memory was created
or worse, justify the need for reintroducing the character again: <p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ASM007_03.jpg
"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1337" title="ASM007_03"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ASM007_03.jpg"
alt="" width="360" height="532" /></a></p> In other words, the interjections
suggest that memory isn’t that important in superhero comics. Or, if it is
important—Batman’s fixation on his parent’s murder for example—it must be
portrayed in a static version, unchanging and never fully understood or
resolved. A single memory might be the impetus for a lifetime of crime
fighting, but a compendium of other memories does not infiltrate upon that
initial memory. There’s no growth, no depth, no working toward understanding
and resolution.

	If, as Jean-Paul Sartre suggests, "the past is the ever growing totality
of the in-itself which we are" (Sartre 167), then what exactly are
superheroes? Sure, Batman’s past is the totally of the “in-itself that he
is,” but I would hardly call it “ever growing.” Superman doesn’t seem to
remember anything other than that Mr. Mxyzptlk needs to say his name
backwards. Even then, he often comes to the memory late, or is reminded by
someone else (often comically the villain his/herself). In short, one of the
things superheroes tend to represent is a perspective that dismisses all but
the most epic of memories in favour of repetition and routine—they have many
habits and they rely on them to get them through most situations.

	Superhero comics rely on what Umberto Eco calls iterative development: “A
series of events repeated according to a set scheme (iteratively, in such a
way that each event takes up again from a sort of virtual beginning, ignoring
where the preceding event left off)” (Eco 19). He goes on to suggest that
“the device of iteration is […] where one distractedly watches the playing
out of a sketch then focuses one's attention on the punch line that
re-appears at the end of the episode. It is precisely on this foreseen and
awaited reappearance that our modest but irrefutable pleasure is based" (Eco
19). It strikes me that an iterative narrative actually encourages the reader
toward habit, away from close reading and scrutiny.

	The point of all this is that the comics rely on the reader not only
suspending disbelief (a flying guy, really?), but also suspending the affect
memory exerts on our reading processes. Most would agree that the more you
read, the better you read. Readers tend to pick up references, sink into the
stylistics of the genre, navigate disruptions in convention more easily, as
they take in more and make themselves informed readers. Comics books pressure
the reassurances and certainties that come from habit. Comics force us to
forget in order to enjoy the nuances of the repeated story.

	The superhero is then miming the interpretive methodology that comics
encourage, one that relies on comfort in repetition rather than the
challenges of discursiveness. Superheroes are not great models for critical
thinking; they are terrible learners. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/
superman_memory.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1340"
title="superman_memory"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/
superman_memory.jpg" alt="" width="303" height="233" /></a></p> That said,
comics occupy a unique position in that they also encourage the encyclopedic
hoarding of discreet facts. I'm looking at you comic book nerd. Despite the
necessity of forgetting, readers--especially those who are particularly
committed to one character / hero--remember, with sometimes maddening detail,
the obscure variations, temporal slips, fractures in continuity, purposeful
refigurings featured within the on-going, repeated, narrative.

	The action of remembering in comics then has little to do with how the
stories engage with the memory of the characters or the event in which they
have been involved. Comics, unlike other media that seem to demand attention
be paid to the singularity of events that led up to the current "situation"
or climax, engage memory when there is discontinuity, in the subtle turns and
twists between the set-up and the punchline. For the seasoned reader, the
superhero comic book—and the characters who dwell within it—are precisely
“the ever growing totality of the in-itself which we are.” Without the
reader’s memory of comics themselves, and the position of those stories in
the reader’s psyche, there is no history, no memory. The comic book narrative
becomes a fortress of interpretive solitude. To recast Eco's claim, the
interpretive action of reading a comic book creates a space in which the
personal past of the reader blends with the past iterations of the character.
While the narrative sequence and story may be repeated, the reader's past is
locked in the moment of encounter. And, the repeated encounters with these
narratives and stories yield an intimate history in which the reader's
past "is the ever growing totality" in-between the set-up and the punchline;
it is the memory. <p style="text-align: center;">Works Cited</p> Eco,

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[As we’ve seen these
past few weeks in Graphixia, memory plays multiple roles in the shaping of
comics’ narratives, operating on many levels both for the characters as well
as for the mainstay readers of comics themselves. The detailed histories
presented in long-running serials present challenges for the authors in
ensuring accuracy, offer avenues to reinvent characters in innovative ways
that are compelling precisely because they defy expectation and
standardization, and are played upon in order to highlight the import of
certain events through editorial commentary to build upon stories or negate
others in order to pursue a static, unchanging representation of the
superhero archetype. The multiple functions of memory create overwhelmingly
diverse ways in which comics can be both written and read, making
long-running comics compelling both for the casual reader as well as the
literary critic alike.

	<a

196x300.jpg" alt="" width="196" height="300" /></a>Jason Aaron’s very recent
(and still running, for one more issue at least) PunisherMax exploits this
multiple use of memory in highly innovative and intriguing ways, playing
against readers’ expectations and reshaping a long-standing Marvel character
to reinvigorate him for a new generation that has greater expectations of
comics as a more literary genre. This series, begun in January of 2010,
rebooted Punisher under Marvel’s “Max” imprint – much like DC’s “Elseworlds,”
creators here are given free rein to rework, reestablish and reinvent
characters as they see fit, with the added incentive of not having to adhere
to any sort of established comics’ code. As a result, these Max comics
(earmarked for adults only) are often rife with graphic violence, sexuality
and expressly adult themes; while these features may not be positives for
many readers, they do allow for a diverse range of authors whose talents
would not otherwise be used to full advantage in more mainstream comics
writing, such as Warren Ellis, and darker, more adult tales from fan (and
critic) favorites Straczynski and Bendis. Aaron’s work on Punisher, gritty
and explicit, certainly belongs under the Max imprint, his stories becoming
all the more gripping and memorable because of their gratuitous nature.

	The Punisher as a character is an exemplar of how memory motivates heroes
and compels them to action. Like many others, Punisher (aka Frank Castle) is
haunted by the death of his family, who in his case were gunned down in a
public park during a sunny afternoon picnic – he himself survived the attack,
which led him to pursue vengeance on all criminals who would do the same to
others. He is not, however, only haunted by the memory of the death of his
family; Castle is also an ex-Marine, shell-shocked and distraught from the
legalized atrocities he both witnessed and performed as a soldier during the
Vietnam War. Different authors who have handled Punisher in the past have
treated these as separate motivators, with Castle being either vengeful at
the death of his wife and children, or a disgruntled soldier who has returned
with a compulsion to exact vengeance on wrongdoing through the methods that
his government has legitimized in a wartime environment. Aaron, however,
condenses these perspectives and plays to both, integrating them to come up
with a more comprehensive – and far more complex – vision of what drives the
Punisher. He co-ordinates this reinvestigation of Castle’s character through
reworking his nemeses’ pasts while reintroducing them for a new audience,
making their pasts his own.

	PunisherMax begins in medias res, with Castle having already established
himself as a counterforce against his city’s criminal element, having been in
operation for some thirty years. Presented as an old man nearing the end of
his run as a hero, Castle is slipping up and making mistakes, leaving
witnesses behind and not ensuring that all of his criminal targets have been
killed. Here is where Aaron introduces his once-familiar nemeses, presented
in this Max universe for the first time as new threats that the wizened
Castle must deal with. The first arc, “Kingpin,” shows Wilson Fisk’s
introduction and rise as the crime boss of Castle’s city. Aaron explores
Fisk’s history by oscillating between past and present, with no familiar
acknowledgement that he’s indicating a flashback – the effect is jolting to
the reader who is left with the implication that the past so informs the
present that no editorial box indicating the shift is necessary. Over the
course of the five issue arc, Fisk’s story parallel’s Castle’s, even in the
way that the panels are constructed:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/
punisherkingpin1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1356"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/
punisherkingpin1-300x241.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="241" /></a>This
construction has the dual effect of showing the characters’ similar paths and
motivations, both born in violence and taking their city by force, and
foreshadowing a similar narrative structure for Castle’s own explorative arc
later in the series. We are left at the end of this five issue introduction
with a Kingpin who has risen to the top of the city’s criminal empire through
manipulation, violence, deceit and, importantly, the sacrifice of his family
– when his son is taken hostage by the crime boss Fisk is designing to
replace, he apologizes to the boy and allows him to die so his own career as
Kingpin can begin. Fisk and Castle are here set up as dual sides of the same
persona and motivators, a fact that Aaron explores more fully in subsequent
arcs.

	The second arc, being “Bullseye,” reintroduces another of Castle’s
nemeses – the titular character having been hired by Fisk to eliminate
Castle. While the reader expects immediate action, however, we are forced to
wait for several issues for it to occur; Bullseye, despite clearly being
portrayed as a violent psychopath, studies Castle’s motivations and personal
history in order to find a flaw through which he can end his life. The reader
explores this past with Bullseye, and the importance of memory as motivation
becomes far more salient as the arc progresses. Bullseye conducts torturous
“interviews” with the only prompt being “tell me what Castle is like,” and he
sleeps on the graves of Castle’s murdered family in order to try to
understand his character. Bullseye goes so far as to attempt to relive the
traumatic event of Castle’s family being killed in the park by kidnapping a
similar family, forcing them to play along as he assumes the role of “loving”
father, and then having them executed in the same setting in an attempt to
replicate the event and feel the same compelling motivation for vengeance.
All of these attempts fail, however, and Bullseye comes to the same
realization that a hero cannot, as is commonly assumed, be explained away by
a singular event as many other popular comics would have us believe:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/
bullseyefamily.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1357"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/bullseyefamily
.jpg" alt="" width="618" height="488" /></a>This skewing of the normal
approach of pigeonholing a hero by a single motivator is further highlighted
by Castle himself. Discussing his next plan of attack, he interrupts his own
conversation with an acknowledgement of his own failing memory:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/
punishermemory.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1358"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/punishermemory
.jpg" alt="" width="606" height="486" /></a>The reader now sees how complex
memory is as a motivator – we are left with a convoluted vision of what
drives characterization and how challenging it can be to reconcile our
actions with even the events that we feel have shaped our own lives, let
alone how challenging it is for others to define us by our pasts. Bullseye
ultimately becomes near comatose for an entire issue of the arc while
attempting to rationalize Castle’s convictions, struggling (verbally, for the
reader’s benefit) with his character but metatextually also with the
apparently irreconcilable ways that Punisher has been presented by past
authors: if Punisher was born in the bloodied jungles of Vietnam, why could
he not detect a trap set for his family in a city park and thereby save them?
Aaron here toys with memory on two fronts, making readers question not only
Castle’s impetus for action, but the illogical and simplistic way that we
have understood him in the past.

	The final confrontation at the end of the arc sees Bullseye having
uncovered the “truth” about Castle, summed up in his family’s final day at
the park and what Castle said to his wife and children right before they were
murdered. Bullseye assumes that there must have been some significant
distraction to cause Castle to fail to recognize the danger he was in and,
with a hand at his throat, Bullseye reveals the correct answer to the
question of what was going through Castle’s mind on the day of the tragedy.
Aaron leaves this to the reader’s imagination, however, making the dialogue
balloon too small for us to see – we acknowledge the wide eyes of the
startled Punisher on realizing that some horrible truth has been uncovered,
but we are not privy to this information. Even after the buildup to this
final confrontation, to sum up Castle’s character in a single line is still
too easy a response for Aaron (and too easy a response for his readers).
Instead, he uses this single unreadable balloon as the impetus for his entire
arc to follow, titled “Frank.”

	<a

bullseyereveal.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1359"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/bullseyereveal
.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="513" /></a>In this penultimate arc for the
series, Aaron shows us through the structure of the book just how significant
memory is both for comics’ characters themselves as well as for the reading
audience. Each issue shifts seamlessly between past and present in exploring
Frank Castle’s past, detailing his time in Vietnam and his home life on his
return, juxtaposed with the present Castle being stuck in prison. As the arc
progresses, more and more pages of each issue are devoted to exploring
Castle’s motivations, all leading up to the fateful day in the park and the
revelation of Castle’s final words to his wife right before she was killed.
By the final issue of the arc, the flashbacks are no longer, strictly
speaking, flashbacks: they open the issue and comprise the bulk of its pages,
and Castle’s past is where the more interesting of the two stories is
contained. The past here supplants the present, and the reader is aware that
Castle’s memories are what inform his present to the degree that it is
overtaken, the present being only a trivial aftereffect of the complex
formative events that made him the hero he has become – when Aaron finally
reveals that Castle had told his wife, seconds before her death, that he was
leaving her because of his struggles with post-traumatic stress and
“pretending [he’s] something [he’s] not,” we not only feel more greatly
informed of his motivations in Aaron’s rendition of PunisherMax but are
forced to rethink all we know of the Punisher as a character, through every
story in which we have ever encountered him. Aaron shows us that Castle is
not haunted by an event that occurred <em>to</em> him, either through the
Vietnam War or through the murder of his family, but by the memory of a
single decision that occurred <em>within</em> him, vocalized only at the last
moment of his normal life. He is haunted by his own failure as a father, as a
husband and as a soldier who either failed to recognize the imminent attack
or, as Aaron subtly implies, allowed it to happen to release him from the
bondage of being a workaday family man. He is tormented by the guilt that no
reader, until this moment, ever thought that this seemingly black and white
character was capable of: on finally admitting the truth of the event, Castle
tells the reader against the backdrop of a gruesome flashback of his family’s
death, “The thing that haunts me now isn’t the moment they died. The moment
my daughter’s belly exploded and my son’s brains came out the back of his
head. No, it’s the moment right before that, when I had everything… And I
threw it all away. There was a time when I wish I’d died with them that day.
But I know the reason I survived. It wasn’t so I could seek revenge in their
name. So I could wage my little war.” With the images shifting into the
present, he continues, “It was so I could suffer …  A lifetime of punishment
... It will never be enough” (Aaron 16, 7-8). Ultimately, Aaron turns the
entire character on his head, in all of his past incarnations, by revealing
that the reason that Castle became the Punisher at all was to punish himself.
The series concludes, just as Aaron foreshadowed, in the final arc titled
“Homeless,” with the Punisher and Kingpin killing each other, neither
character ultimately able to come to terms with their irreconcilable past.
Castle dies on the steps of his family’s long-abandoned home; even in his
final act, he forfeits the present in order to return to his motivations and
his guilt over his personal failures. These final panels of PunisherMax
vacillate consistently between past and present, leaving the reader unsure as
to which story Aaron is more intent on telling.

	Though it is difficult to sum up the merits of an entire series in a
single post, Aaron’s deft handling of characterization in PunisherMax
exemplifies how significant a theme memory can be in understanding comics. In
manipulating the memories of both his readers and his characters, Aaron shows
us that even the most static, morally rigid heroes can be overwhelmingly
complex if provided the right treatment and if we choose to see past
archetypal renderings of familiar protagonists. By closely juxtaposing hero
and villain, employing flashbacks to an extent rarely seen in mainstream
comics and forcing us to see the past as present, he provides a depth to the
Punisher that, on rereading, resonates into previous incarnations of the
character without conflicting with other authors’ stories. His work on the
series is “retconning,” or employing retroactive continuity, at its most
impressive: Aaron takes a character who is fueled by memory and exploits this
fact to revision the most fundamental attributes of what compels him to
action, showing us that memory for a fictional character can be just as
complex as it is in the “real” world. In Aaron’s refusal to understand his
characters as two dimensional and stock, we are reminded that even superhero
archetypes can – and likely should – be approached with the same critical eye
with which we address all characters in literature. Their memories, like our
own, reveal much about their actions in the present and inform every story in
which we encounter them.

_SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>I love Oscar Wilde.

	Of course, who doesn't?  Announcing an adoration for Wilde is about as
controversial as declaring that sunshine is pleasant or cookies are
delicious.  Are there Oscar haters even out there?  I can't imagine it.  But
I've aways felt a particular affinity for the man, and for a short period in
my life considered being a Victorianist exclusively so I could work on Wilde
(and then I saw all the other stuff I'd have to read and thought again).

	So when we decided we were doing a <em>Cerebus</em> cycle, I knew
immediately that I was going to focus on issue 6, <em>Melmoth.</em>

	<em><!--more--></em>

	By the time <em>Melmoth</em> comes along, Cerebus needs some downtime.
 He believes Jaka is dead and, basically, he's catatonic.  And in his state,
he ends up at a café near the hotel where Oscar Wilde is living out the last
days of his life.  "Melmoth" was the alias Wilde lived under in Paris after
he was released for Reading Gaol, and that's where the title of this issue
comes from.  In Cerebus's monomythic cycle of the hero, I suppose this issue
fulfills the role of an apotheosis; Cerebus is resting up for his return to
battle (though he doesn't know it in the moment).  As a result, we get an
exquisitely beautiful and touching interlude about the final days of Oscar
Wilde's life.

	Dave Sim intersperses excerpts from Robert Ross's letters about Wilde's
declining condition with images of Wilde's suffering body and Cerebus's
catatonia.  One of the most striking things about this is the way Sim
constructs the dying Wilde to be, well, frankly grotesque.  Which is, one
supposes, as it should be; Wilde is wasting away as he dies slowly and
painfully of meningitis.  But how often do we see cultural representations of
Wilde looking ugly?  It's jarring to see a representation of our favourite
aesthete brought degraded and low.

	This choice to make Wilde look, well, human and fallible in his death is
an interesting one, as is the choice to have this story told not by Cerebus
(the protagonist of the larger story) or Wilde himself (ever the performance
artist and protagonist in the drama of his own life), but by Robert Ross.
 Ross, a Canadian journalist and critic, was Wilde's companion in his final
days (and off-and-on through his life); Ross is a side-kick figure in the
historical record, known more for his role as Wilde's literary executor than
for any of his own works.  I think this is important.  With both our
protagonists fallen silent for a time, Ross fills in where neither Cerebus
nor Wilde is able.

	Wilde rendered both silent and ugly is a drastic departure from his
cultural role.  But it's an important one, given that Sim seems to parallel
Wilde's death with Cerebus snapping out of his catatonia.  Indeed, it is not
until the epilogue that Cerebus finds both voice and action, the very things
that Wilde has been robbed of throughout the text.

	Why?

	When people talk about the resurgence of interest in Oscar Wilde,
especially in the 1990s, they often talk in terms of a resurrection; not a
biblical one, of course (though imagine!), but a resurrection of reputation.
 Wilde was great, then brought low, but is now pretty much universally
thought of as great again.  His death, paradoxically, became the first step
towards his reparation.  Likewise, Wilde's death becomes a catalyst for
Cerebus's own reanimation; not until after Wilde dies is he able to snap out
of his disconnected state.  In fact, he sits and witnesses the funeral
procession but immediately afterwards drifts off to sleep, seemingly for the
first time since his arrival.  Wilde's death releases Cerebus into sleep;
when he awakens, it is to overhear a conversation that jolts him into deadly
action and he is back on his own quest.  But Wilde's death spurs on that
rebirth, much as it spurred on his own.

	If you love Oscar Wilde, <em>Melmoth</em> is puzzling and upsetting but
ultimately quite moving.  Sim forces us to renegotiate some of our ideas
about who Wilde was and what his final days were like.  There is little of
Wilde's wit and whimsy here, and a whole lot of tragedy and sorrow.  But it's
a choice that both humanizes Wilde and mythologizes Cerebus, allowing them to
share in the power of the death of Oscar Wilde.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong
id="internal-source-marker_0.13162503438070416">I have to admit to knowing
almost nothing about Cerebus, Dave Sim’s magnum opus of 300 issues. I have
only heard vague rumblings of Sim’s genius and eccentricity. Scott assures me
that the series becomes complex and literary, as Brenna’s post on the
“Melmoth” Oscar Wilde sequence will show.  My problem in writing this post is
that I couldn’t just jump to the genius issues. I had to start at the
beginning. And the beginning of Cerebus is nothing much: funny animal as
Conan the Barbarian about sums it up. Many associate Cerebus with Howard the
Duck, a comic that I never read as a kid because it violated my sense of
realism, which is funny considering that I read a ton of super hero
comics.</strong>

	Apparently, Cerebus began as a parody of the “Sword and Sorcery” genre.
It is a truism that in order to parody something, you must understand it in
detail. Because I never had any affinity for this genre, a parody of it is
more or less meaningless to me. The one time my attention sparked during the
first ten issues was when a character spoke in the manner of Foghorn Leghorn
from the Warner Brothers cartoons. But I had no idea why an artist would do
such a thing. The “accent” seemed as out of place as an aardvark seeking
adventure and treasure.

	Because I was having trouble reading Cerebus in a disciplined way, I
decided that the only thing to do was skip ahead. I decided to read every
tenth issue, and so jumped to issue #20. This move was fortuitous because
this issue marks a key transition for Sim. The serial nature of many comics
frequently entails several shifts in approach. The artwork and themes
transform over time so that a comic can become radically different from how
it started out. Because Cerebus is mostly a one-man work (Gerhard, Sim’s
background artist, teamed up with him in 1984) rather than a comic produced
by different teams of artists and writers, these transformations bear the
mark of an auteur, reflecting Sim’s relationship to comics and the world.
Cerebus ultimately shifted to political and religious themes as the comic
became less of a genre parody and more the expression of a worldview. Issue
#20 is an important step in the development of this worldview.

	If you unstaple the pages of the comic, you can put them together like a
simple jigsaw puzzle so that they form a large image of Cerebus’ body. The
dialogue of the issue weaves around this image. As Cerebus moves through the
plot of the comic, his relationship to his own body determines which
conversation he is in. The comic essentially does away with panels, and plays
fast and loose with the left to right, top to bottom reading process. The
reader has to do some mental adjustments to his or her comics reading
paradigm to follow along. Because Cerebus is drugged, these adjustments
correspond with the main character’s predicament; he is initially disoriented
and confused. In reorienting the conventional comic reading path, Sim is able
to play with ideas of mind and body, inside and outside, and hedonism and
austerity.

	Through the issue, Cerebus conducts two conversations, one with Perce and
Wenda, who are “Cirinists,” a group devoted to an austere matriarchal
religion opposed to fun of any kind, and one with Suenteus Po, the founder of
“Illusionism,” that celebrates intoxication and bodily pleasures.  If he is
within the outlines of his body, he speaks to Po, while if he is outside of
those outlines, he speaks to Perce and Wenda.  Apart from Cerebus’ the voices
are disembodied, so instead of speech bubbles with tails, we see radiant
bubbles for the Cirinists and double-lined bubbles for Suenteus Po. After an
initial disorientation, we soon sort out who is speaking and what order we
should read in. Our brains are  like cameras on autofocus: what was initially
blurry becomes clear as the lenses adjust. So, although we depend upon
conventions to understand how to read a comic, if those conventions
disappear, it does not take us long to figure out the new pattern, as long as
there is a pattern.

	Presumably, most western comics are arranged so that the narrative
proceeds from the top right of the page to the bottom left of the page,
moving left to right along each row because they emulate text, so the
organization of text determines the organization of images. But while there
is a necessity that text move in that direction, there is no necessity for
images to do so, partly because we don’t read each panel in the same way that
we read the sequence of panels. Rather, our eyes move over the panel
following the dictates of perspective in art: vanishing points, focal points,
and such. Cerebus # 20 is an example of comics that reflects on the medium’s
relationship to text and attempts to establish a different visual order. Thus
the issue is an exercise in disorienting and re-orienting, so the reader
enters an altered state like that a drug might bring on. We can conceive of
the struggle between hedonism and austerity that Cerebus mediates in the
narrative as also being a struggle between creativity and convention in the
comics medium that Sim struggles with to bring this comic out of
convention-bound parody into a philosophical and aesthetic space in its own
right.

	Readers of my previous posts will know that one of the things that
fascinates me is the presentation of double worlds in comics, the way comics
use their mapping of time onto space to create two worlds operating
simultaneously. For instance, the world of the super hero and the world of
mundane reality. Issue #20 is Cerebrus’ entry into that aspect of comics.
Perhaps one the reasons I had trouble getting to grips with Sim’s comic is
that the Sword and Sorcery genre, however fantastic, tends to be a one-world
genre even in Cerebus’ parodic model. You are either in it or out of it in
that Dungeons and Dragons sort of way. Here we see a narrative and artistic
doubling that remains patently fantastic, but adds an interesting complexity
that goes beyond Foghorn Leghorn voices.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[The artwork in the
“Melmoth” sequence of <em>Cerebus</em> is meticulously rendered and puts one
in mind of <a title="#43 There Are No Words, but…"
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2011/10/12/43-there-are-no-words-but/"
target="_blank">woodcut artists such as Lynd Ward</a>. Coming on the heels of
the Jaka’s story sequence and the desolation it creates in Cerebus, who takes
up residence at Dino’s and stares into space clutching Jaka’s doll, “Melmoth”
is a good, albeit, arbitrary starting point for a discussion of the
aesthetics at play in <em>Cerebus</em>.

	The focus here is on the covers for the “Melmoth” sequence and how they
reinforce several aesthetic markers for both the narrative and the
characters. Taken together, the covers signal different character and
temporal foci while at the same time suggesting the recurring thematic and
structural markers for the storyline. <p style="text-align: center;"><a

674x1024.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="368" /></a></p> Given the
subject-oriented focus of the other “Melmoth” covers, the above two covers
might seem like an odd starting point, but they introduce two key components
of the artistic iconography: the first is arcs over doorways or windows and
the second is close ups that signal a relationship between the iconography
and character--in this case, Wilde and flowers. These aesthetic templates
repeat themselves throughout the storyline, appearing in nearly every panel
in one form or another. The covers then “set the aesthetic tone” for the
reader, introducing the key iconographic repetitions into the narrative—one
has only to think about the role of the repeated “happy face” in
<em>Watchmen</em> for successful applications of such iconographic symbology
in constructing narrative sequences in comic books. <p style="text-align:
center;"><a

691x1024.jpg" alt="" width="249" height="368" /></a></p> The above covers,
while maintaining the characteristic rounded doorways and windows, and
clustered close-ups or obscured frames, focus on characters in the act of
contemplation. Itself a major theme in “Melmoth,” contemplation is of course
something the readers of <em>Cerebus</em> must do as we try to penetrate the
sometimes restrictive detail of the interior artwork. In short, the cover
suggests a reflective narrative that turns inward, signalling Cerebus’
contemplation of Jaka’s death. Of course, the primary figure of death in
“Melmoth” is Wilde and the act of contemplation is something he desperately
wishes to avoid throughout the narrative. The cover images themselves demand
our contemplation, and when taken in concert provide a parallel narrative to

that depict characters in the act of contemplation, the covers above suggest
exteriors that are tilted and shift according to temporal shifts between
Cerebrus’ present and Wilde’s past. The recurring iconography of curves,
crossed windows, and gas lamps continues, but the covers expose the different
atmospheric conditions of the storyline. At times dark, light, close, far,
and empty the covers juxtapose the parallels between Cerebus’ Dino’s Cafe and
Wilde’s Hôtel d’Alsace, the presence and absence of humanity, longing and
anxiety, bringing the two main characters of the overall sequence into closer
relief while at the same time emphasizing similarities in psychological
states. <p style="text-align: center;"><a

focus on Wilde and the immediate surroundings of his hotel room. They
iconography, at once bright and colourful in contrast to his sickly presence
and failing health and dark and shadowy symbolizing his own secrecy and
denial. The cover images also bring forward the curved windows and panelled
doors, in this case bringing them inside, and set in place the connection
between Wilde and flowers (both an allusion to Wilde’s dandyism / sexual
orientation and his death). They also vary the perspective of Wilde from
cover to cover--close up, from his point of view, and far away from above.
The covers represent Wilde's fractured psyche while carrying forward the
essential symbology of the narrative arc and the notion that death sets one
free, where one can look down on the elegant scene. The repeated iconography
crosses over settings when we take the wallpaper into account (the source of
perhaps the most famous Wilde quote of all: “My wallpaper and I are fighting
a duel to death. One of us has to go” (Ellman 546)). Bringing forward the
colour scheme from Wilde’s room, the birds traversing the sky and casting
shadows over a contemplative, imbibing, Wilde recall the dominant iconography
of the wallpaper and his fast-approaching mortality. <p style="text-align:

above that dominates the middle of the final episode in Wilde’s narrative arc
solidifies the iconography of the covers by bringing together the dominant
motifs of the cover images (settings, curves, squares, sitting figures,
compressed frames, and a downward walk instead of upward struggle) as it also
brings together the two central characters of the broader narrative arc,
effectively closing off the Wilde storyline and rejuvenating Cerebus’
storyline.

	Sequences such as “Melmoth” remind us that covers play an essential role
in establishing the iconography central to reading comics. Covers are often
teasers—the <em>Cerebus</em> covers are in colour, something the interior is
not—both distorting and foreshadowing the content of the book it buttresses.
At the same time, they set the important symbology of the narrative, coaxing
us to read the content in a particular way, keeping relationships between
symbology, the characters, and the narrative they all work to enact.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[When I first
recommended Dave Sim’s magnum opus Cerebus for a Graphixia theme, I have to
admit that I had forgotten how unwieldy a tome the series was – I had first
read it over the course of two decades as each individual issue came out and
become an immediate fan, following the series i<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/
CerebusSketch1.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-1448"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CerebusSketch1
-217x300.jpg" alt="My Cerebus Sketch" width="217" height="300" /></a>n great
detail and even commissioning a sketch of Cerebus from Sim himself (I don't
have much reason or opportunity to show it off, so I've included it to the
right) . Spanning three hundred issues over the course of nearly thirty
years, Cerebus is comics’ longest running maxi-series and has inspired a
legion of fans from across the globe; there are many fan websites devoted to
the character, a secondary series exploring nuances and themes in the comic
titled “Following Cerebus,” as well as a <a title="Cerebus Wiki"
href="http://www.cereb.us/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page"
target="_blank">Cerebus wiki</a> in which users contribute analysis of the
many (often ambiguous) themes that parallel the central narrative. The series
is also comics’ longest running and most successful independent title, having
been produced in-house at Sim’s own Aardvark Vanaheim publishing company. The
series began in 1977 as a straightforward parody of Conan the Barbarian in
which the protagonist was replaced by a diminutive (but deadly) talking
aardvark, but Cerebus quickly became the outlet for many of Sims’ lofty and
often highly contentious ideas. There is also arguably no other series in
popular comics that is so self-consciously literary, to the degree that by
the midpoint of the series, in what has now been collected in the graphic
novel “Reads,” Sim forewent regular comic panels altogether and replaced them
with full pages of tiny-font text in which he took on the alias Viktor Davis
to espouse his philosophies on gender. Cerebus has been wildly experimental
in terms of content, style and form over its lengthy run, and many of comics’
more mainstream creators and artists, such as Todd McFarlane, point to Sim’s
epic as being an inspiration for their own processes. It will undoubtedly be
under continued study for decades to come, underappreciated in its time as
many of the great literary works tend to be.

	It would be impossible to offer a summation of the series in a single
posting (as I’ve vainly tried to do with much, much shorter runs on
Graphixia), and any attempt at doing so would likely come off as
unapproachable as someone attempting to get a friend on board with the
intricacies of “Lost” near the end of its run. Cerebus is many things over
the course of the eponymous title: an aardvark, an hermaphrodite, a Prime
Minister, a Pope, a living voice of God (or Tarim) on Earth, a simple
mendicant who finds himself in impossible situations, a barbarian, a jealous
lover, a self-aware yet still fictional construct, and so on. We watch him
progress throughout his life with bemusement as he falls prey equally to
slapstick comedy as well as the machinations of politics, thoughtful
reveries, existential crises and religious epiphanies. The story of Cerebus,
as intricately woven as it is, however, is interspersed with Sim’s own
philosophies that ultimately supplant the narrative. After weaving a highly
complex story of Cerebus’ quest to meet with God, finding that each
civilization (and there have been many before his own) have attempted the
same goal, Cerebus finds himself encountering Sim himself. This volume,
Minds, which will be the focus of my post, arguably marks the end of the
Cerebus story, with the title afterwards becoming almost entirely a vehicle
for Sim’s exploration of the then-current changes in his personal life (most
notably in his religious studies of the Torah), delving into literature
(through parodic characters in F. Stop Fitzgerald and Ham Ernestway) and
sociological commentary in the form of open attacks on what he believes to be
the rise of Marxist-Feminism and the subsequent downfall of modern society.
“Minds” is a turning point for Cerebus both as a character and as a series,
because it is in this chapter that Cerebus literally meets his maker, as Sim
injects himself into the story, breaking the fourth wall in such an elaborate
way as comics, and perhaps even literature in general, has never seen before.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CerebusMinds.
jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1449"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CerebusMinds-
221x300.jpg" alt="" width="221" height="300" /></a>At this point in the
overall narrative, Cerebus is attempting to rival one of the other Aardvarks,
Cirin, to meet with his creator and find out, most importantly, whether or
not the divine Creator is male or female (some have argued that this
correlates directly with misogynic statements that run throughout the title).
Flying through space on a throne (see what I mean about tough to explain?),
Cerebus begins to hear a voice in his head that identifies itself as “Dave.”
As the dialogue between the two progresses in Cerebus’ thought balloons, Sim
clears up some minor mysteries for his readers by openly resolving some
dangling narrative threads: Cerebus was stabbed in the uterus when he was a
child so he can’t bear children, he misplaced some important idols in his
past which was the reason that he never attained the level of conquest he
dreamed of in the series’ early issues. Sim explains to a bewildered Cerebus
that he is his creator, in essence the God that the protagonist has been
looking for, and Cerebus attempts to rationalize being a character in a
densely wrought universe that exists on an entirely different plane from that
of Sim himself. Interestingly, when juxtaposed with the earlier volumes of
the Cerebus storyline, this is really what all civilizations make an attempt
at – reaching a transcendental plane in which we can see beyond the
narratives of our own lives.

	Sim, however, implies that Cerebus’ actual actions in the story are not
entirely in Dave’s own hands. In direct dialogue with his creation, he
explains to Cerebus that “I introduce a situation into your life, you react
to it. I neither approve or disapprove of your reaction, I don’t punish or
reward you. I note your reaction and provide the consequences – in the form
of the next situation. Your reaction implies the next situation … and so on”
(133). In a sense, Sim is explaining what characterization in a long running
serial truly is: Cerebus, because of his detailed history as a character, is
expected to behave in particular ways. He is no longer under his creators’
control and, in a sense, has transcended fiction because of this. This is not
to say that Cerebus is a predictable character – far from it – but it’s that
even any unpredictability becomes part of his character itself. Sim is left
with little more recourse than providing the next element of the story to
which his creation, now in a sense under his own control, must react. He
extends this idea further as Cerebus asks him to make his long-lost love,
Jaka, fall for him again for the duration of the three hundred issue
storyline. Sim shows Cerebus the ultimate folly of this through narrating and
visualizing what the story would be like: Sim could create the situation of a
loving relationship, but Cerebus would, in the end,<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CerebusJaka.
jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1450"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CerebusJaka-
300x250.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250" /></a> remain Cerebus despite
Dave’s best efforts to the contrary. Run to its conclusion, Cerebus would
remain aggressive, abusive and unsatisfied with her because that is the
nature of his established character. Though it may seem paradoxical that a
creator cannot reshape his creation, Sim shows us that this is truly the
case; in a way, because of readers’ expectations and because of the nature of
character development, Cerebus’ actions are mandated by a reality that exists
beyond Sim’s control.

	Frustrated with explaining himself to his creation and what he has
become, Sim beats Cerebus and explains how much his actions have hurt others.
Sim also interestingly explains how Cerebus’ actions have hurt him over the
many years he has spent writing him – Sim has suffered himself, having had to
make other characters suffer because of how Cerebus’ character has naturally
evolved. As a result, Sim openly provides the next “situation” for Cerebus,
giving him a stye that must be lanced, a very traumatic surgical process that
he explains to his character (and readers) that he went through himself as a
youth. Sim <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/
CerebusScalpel.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1451"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CerebusScalpel
-193x300.jpg" alt="" width="193" height="300" /></a>explains the “injury to
eye” motif and how it arose in early 1950’s pulp, then proceeds to take a
scalpel to his creation’s eye, hauntingly stating “let me show you what you
have done unto others … let me show you all at once” (243). As a storyteller,
then, Sim is left with at least some power – though he can’t compel his
character to act in a particular way, he can in fact make him suffer through
tragic and fearful situations.

	After making Cerebus endure the surgery, Sim seems at a loss as to what
to do with him. He tells his creation that his life and situational contexts,
from at least this point in the narrative forward, are his own: “you are the
baker, and your life is the bread” (127), offering Cerebus a choice as to
where the narrative will go next. Given the unlimited possibility of any
situational context in which to act out his final hundred issues, Cerebus
ultimately decides on none – he merely wants his creator to go away. Sim,
surprised at this, actually draws himself into the story; hunched over his
desk, he suppresses a laugh, and wishes Cerebus a happy epilogue.

	Cerebus does, however, finally decide to return to a narrative life,
refusing to be stranded out of his creators’ eye on the distant planet on
which Sim has deposited him. Cerebus makes a phone call in his own head to
the offices of Aardvark Vanaheim, begging “Dave” to pay attention to him
again and take him back. He finally decides that he’d like to spend his final
days at an inn, playing sports and drinking the remainder of his life away
with his friends, a decision that prompts the next arc in the series, “Guys.”
At the last, the reader is left with the sense that, perhaps, Sim has
finished the telling of the surface Cerebus story of fantasy and political
intrigue. The ostensibly benevolent act of giving his creation complete
control over his own situational context, as previously mentioned, descends
over the next hundred issues into a personal journey of Sim’s own interests
and bugbears in modern life, with Cerebus as both character and narrative
taking a backseat to this fundamental focus. This is not to say that the
remainder of the text is not worthy of study – far from it – but Sim seems
content that his creation has come to his ultimate fruition, existing in a
reality that ironically surpasses Sim’s own. I’m reminded of Grant Morrison’s
own reflection regarding his run on Animal Man in the early 1990’s here, in
that he acknowledged that the character will long outlive him and, in doing
so, is in a sense more real than he as the author could ever hope to be.

	With “Minds,” as elsewhere in Cerebus, Sim explores what it means to be
an artist and the creator of an intricate universe coupled with the complex
nature of free will – as rich and dense a history as he concocts throughout
the first two hundred issues of his story, he ultimately acquiesces to the
power that his creation has over him. One could argue that he loses himself
in the task and, faced with being superseded by his creation, falls prey to
his own interests that become the brunt of the story in the final third of
the series while openly and regularly publishing opinionated essays in the
endnotes of the individual issues. This said, “Minds” is an ideal and
fascinating examination of the necessary duality inherent in the creative
process, showcasing the mindset of a creator who has had complete control
over his comic character longer than any other writer in comics’ history.
Though even the surface story of Cerebus is one of comics’ most intricate and
self-consciously philosophical sagas, punctuated with slapstick and running
the gamut of the disciplines in its varying themes, it is also an intensely
wrought exploration of the artistic process on the whole.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[“It’s about this really
unlucky guy who finally hits rock bottom and ends up getting killed in a case
of mistaken identity...And here’s the thing. The man writing the story is
gay, and he hangs around this other guy and just observes him” (41).

	A typical representation of trauma in narrative is where one character
reports on another’s horrific or mysterious death. Psychological trauma thus
becomes identified with concepts like loss, mourning and memory that demand
analysis and interpretation of the relationship’s meaning, as if a
relationship can only be properly understood after it has been traumatised.
Furthermore, the dead other transforms into something like a saintly cipher.
Who was that person? What did he or she mean? Through asking such questions,
the character who lives on comes to understand something about him or
herself.

	Natsume Ono’s manga <em>Not Simple</em> presents such a relationship
between two characters, Jim and Ian, where Jim is in a position to interpret
Ian’s trauma. Jim writes a novel about the traumatic life of his friend and
then disappears. While <em>Not Simple</em> has an omniscient point of view,
the relationship it creates between Jim and Ian recalls novels like
<em>Moby-Dick</em> and <em>The Great Gatsby</em> in which the narrator acts
as a lens through which we see the main character’s story, as if perceiving
that story directly would be like staring at the sun. But the relationship
between the teller and the told-about creates a feedback that makes us think
about what the story means to the teller. In <em>Moby-Dick</em>, Ahab remains
after the wreck of the Pequod, the only survivor to report on events. In
<em>Not Simple</em>, Jim would appear to be in Ishmael’s position, but
ultimately he is not the “voice” of this manga, tempting as it may be to put
him in that role. Rather, he is the enigma of the narrative: the mysterious
counterpart to the all-too-clear story of his friend.

	Jim’s interest in Ian starts when he interviews him for a Melbourne
newspaper. Ian is a competitive runner who creates curiosity when he
extravagantly celebrates finishing fourth in a race. In the course of this
interview, Ian reveals things about himself that Jim can’t use for the paper,
but preserves for an idea for a novel. From then on the two are linked. When
Ian discovers that his lost sister is in America, he accompanies Jim, who has
a new job in New York. Ian drifts away from Jim in his search for his sister,
but always returns to haunt him.

	At first read of <em>Not Simple</em>, Ian, with his horrible life, is the
dominant character; the story is structured around his search for his sister
across the United States. Ian’s story is so complex that it would take two
pages to account for its twists. Here are the key points:

	&nbsp; <ul> <li>He is child of an incestuous relationship between his
father and his sister.</li> <li>His father’s wife is an alcoholic who lets a
pimp shop Ian as a child prostitute.</li> <li>His “sister” goes to prison for
a botched bank job and takes up with Ian’s old pimp (though neither knows
about this prior relationship).</li> <li>He is infected with HIV</li> <li>He
is murdered by the henchman of an angry father, when a girl poses him as her
boyfriend</li> </ul> Ian’s story depicts the worst possible life one could
imagine. Consequently, we might dismiss it as implausible, overly
melodramatic, or perhaps only distasteful to bourgeois taste (because we know
many people live such lives of disaster and ruin). Ian’s narrative is what
Greek tragedy looks like when the characters aren’t kings and queens. And
with its incest plot and uncanny revelations, <em>Not Simple</em> is
something of an Oedipus story.

	“Not simple” refers not only to the plot but also to Ian himself. He
initially appears to be somewhat simple-- “a person unclouded by too much
thought” as Jim puts it (181)-- in the way he accepts the things that happen
to him without much reaction. For example when he tells the story of his
experience as a child prostitute, he does so without any affect or moral
indignation, as if he doesn’t know that it is strange or wrong. And Ian
persists in his belief in the integrity of families, no matter how terrible
or ‘not simple’ they are. This lack of reaction, as a form of understatement,
sparks our own horrified response.

	We expect Jim to respond as well. But he and his friend Rick just tell
Ian not to talk about his prostitution experience with anyone else. Jim
remains an observer even in the most traumatic moments. For example, the one
time that Ian does shaken--when he returns from visiting his sister’s
ex-boyfriend, who turns out to be the pimp who gave him gum in exchange for
sex--Jim immediately puts on his jacket to go visit the pimp for information
for his novel. Jim’s relationship to Ian is not quite prurient, but it has a
dimension that makes us question his ethics. He seems to be using Ian as raw
material for his novel, with a writer’s objective distance. But this
indulgence in someone else’s trauma makes us see that Ian is a mirror for
Jim, a way of coming to grips with his own problems.

	Whereas Ian’s story is all about shocking revelation, Jim’s is about
quiet repression. Ian desperately seeks his family, but Jim carefully avoids
his because of their reaction to his sexuality: “Here I am trying to avoid my
family...but they keep finding me. Meanwhile, Ian’s still searching for his
family...” (208).<a

2012-04-02-at-7.53.52-PM.png" alt="" width="513" height="265" /></a> The
image of Jim that stands out is him standing before the phone or a phone
booth on the verge of making a call home. Ian’s traumatic life, coupled with
his nonchalant response to it, exposes Jim’s inability to deal with his own
family issues, the biggest of which is his father’s inability to accept his
homosexuality. When Jim does make a call to his family, and his mother tells
him that his father has rethought his position and that he can come home, we
see that as the sticking point of the story. The plot of mistaken identity
involving Ian, murdered by an angry father who believes he is his daughter’s
boyfriend, appears as a displacement of Jim’s own fears of paternal
retribution. No forgiveness from his family can relieve these fears--the
manga repeats the image of characters whose faces have been bandaged after
they have been struck by family members. By representing Jim in this way,
<em>Not Simple</em> is not so much criticizing him as presenting his position
as complex to balance Ian’s apparent simplicity.

	Jim’s response to Ian’s death is to narrativize it. He immediately starts
thinking about writing his book, figuring out characters and names: “You’ll
be in it too...Your name’ll be...Alicia” (34). So doing, he neatly packages
up the traumatic experience and pushes it away from himself. <em>Not
Simple</em> is not Jim’s novel; rather it is the graphic displacement of that
narrative so that it re-frames the focus of interpretation and mystery. We
know everything there is to know about Ian, in all its melodramatic horror.
Jim, the writer/novelist, becomes the cipher. And with that twist, Natsume
Ono turns <em>Not Simple</em> from a narrative that lays out a traumatic
story for all to see to one that conceals its traumatic kernel and maintains
its secrecy.

runaways_comic_book_cover_01.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="545" /></a>So I
really like young adult fiction, and I really like comics.  And sometimes, a
series pops up that allows me to blend my love of both.  Marvel's
<em>Runaways</em> series, initially by Brian K. Vaughn but later taken over
by Joss Whedon and then something of a rotating cast of folks, deals with a
group of young people who are forced to hang out together because their
parents are friends.  Except their parents aren't friends.  Their parents are
a group of supervillains called The Pride, and the teenagers find this out
when they witness their parents sacrificing a young girl.  While this would
drive a non-Marvel group of teens into therapy, the Runaways, as they come to
be known, decide to be good to their parents' evil and right the wrongs in
their family legacies.  The series started in 2005, though I kind of lost
interest when Whedon left the series at issue #30, so this post focuses on
issues 1-30.  <em>Runaways</em> has been on hiatus for some time, but there's
a movie slated for 2014 -- so I'm either behind schedule or ahead of schedule
in writing this, I suppose.

	When we set the theme for this month at Graphixia as trauma, I knew I
would talk about <em>Runaways</em>.  The series operates on the premise that
trauma can be overcome with good deeds, and that one's traumatic past is not
necessarily one's destiny.  The tagline for the series is, "At some point in
their lives, all young people believe their parents are evil... but what if
they really are?" -- the protagonists are torn between running from the
legacy of their past traumas and facing the reality of where they come from
head on, especially when they discover their own mutant powers and their
status as outlaws in the mutant world (particularly with the series
dovetailing with the <em>Civil War</em> storyline).

	In the first issue, a number of different ways of coping with trauma
emerge as the characters decide what to do about their names.  Many of the
characters opt to completely distance themselves from their parents.  Nico
rebrands herself as Sister Grimm, and Karolina becomes Lucy in the Sky upon
the discovery of her ability to fly.  Others exemplify the tension between
the lives their parents led and their own, like Gertrude who renames herself
Arsenic and wants to eschew all knowledge of her parents, but is accompanied
by the dinosaur her parents genetically engineered to protect her.  And
finally, some develop a truly complicated sense of self in the wake of
trauma: Alex Wilder opts to retain his name, asserting, "I recognize that my
parents have ruined that name, but I don't want to run from it.  I want to
redeem it."  While the characters allow Alex the space to feel this way, in
the narrative the decision <strong>not</strong> to rename himself comes to
represent his loyalty to his parents in spite of their evil; when the
Runaways are finally able to destroy the Pride and a resurrected version of
Alex's father, he is unable to act and dies in the process.  In the world of
<em>Runaways</em>, renaming is an essential part of truly reframing one's
life in the wake of trauma.

	Interestingly, however, the renamings don't last.  What is important is
not the new identity that the names represent, but the name as a symbolic
choice to distance oneself from the trauma imposed by the parents.  The
choice not to rename brands Alex as separate and apart from his friends,
unable to develop his own identity distinct from his parents and eventually
leading to his betrayal of his friends and ultimate death.  But as the
Runaways destroy the Pride, the need for separate selves seems to dissipate
and the characters return to their original names.  The characters' growth no
longer needs to be symbolized by names as it has begun to be exemplified by
actions as the Runaways dismantle the legacy of the Pride. Instead, they are
able to make sense of themselves as whole people, distinct from the choices
made by their parents but products of a difficult, traumatic history.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Created to function as
a commodity, something to be purchased, read, and thrown away, quickly
replaced by the next issue, comics have always had an inferiority complex.
Though the medium has gained traction in elite intellectual circles and
expanded its story arcs beyond black and white moral tales, it clings to its
underdog status. It does so because without the impending trauma that comes
with obsolescence, comics would cease being innovative.

	As a subject for interpretation in the comics medium, trauma is a
foundational theme. Superman’s arrival on earth from a dead world, Batman’s
ascension from the psychological cave created as he bore witness to his
parent’s death, Jimmy Corrigan’s ongoing disassociation from anything
resembling a father, Valdek’s stationary cycling through memories of the
Holocaust, all serve to prime readers for the character’s battle with
traumatic events.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/maus-cover12.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1519" title="maus-cover1"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/maus-cover12-
211x300.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="300" /></a>

	<span style="text-align: left;">Trauma is so frequent in comic narratives
it is almost overwrought. It’s presence a requirement for any story within
the medium. Even Archie and Jughead dance with the trauma common to all, of
being in high school, relationships, sexual innuendo. Trauma is the necessary
fissure in any storyline that moves the characters to action—the classic
example of course being Rorschach whose psychological trauma pulsates in his
mask, his social outlook, and his behavior toward the criminal
element.</span> <p style="text-align: left;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/rorschach.png
"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1520" title="rorschach"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/rorschach-
300x158.png" alt="" width="300" height="158" /></a></p> Not only is trauma
present, it’s worked over. One of the essential elements of the genre’s
narrative form is to constantly revisit the traumatic moment, both to remind
readers and rev the engine that will propel the character development into
new regions. As Eco notes, superheroes are doomed to repeat their storylines
lest they be “consumed,” just as “slice of life” comics are doomed to revisit
the character’s past, the causes of her present predicament, or the impending
crisis of some looming moment. Even seemingly innocuous comic treatments such
as the graphic version of the 9/11 report themselves rely on the traumatic
event itself to justify such visual retellings.

	Littered with failed relationships, murdered family members, suicide,
dead fathers, dead worlds, parallel dimensions, military coups, last stands,
comics are the medium for the traumatic.

	<a

superman_origins.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1521"

src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/
superman_origins-193x300.png" alt="" width="193" height="300" /></a>

	Of course, comics also work it through. Constantly on the verge of being
rendered redundant by failing sales, flagging readership, and other media
overwhelming their position, comics are a medium in the habit of responding
to trauma. Their story arcs reflect this perseverance. In fact, it’s
ingrained into the medium itself. The very presence of the traumatic
consistently through all the varied narrative modes comics have to offer
speaks to the central role coping with the traumatic plays in the medium.

	<a

300x213.png" alt="" width="300" height="213" /></a>

	Comics, better than any other medium, responds to the threat of
obsolescence by reinventing itself. An ironic twist in that its storylines,
particularly in the case of superheroes, are repetitive; its non-superhero
formats dominated by the personal memoire, which revisits and repeats a
familiar narrative. What keeps comics innovative and adaptable to myriad
onslaughts from other media is their experience with the traumatic. The
medium and its storylines are built on the traumatic; its readers expect the
traumatic. To put it baldly, comics never need to develop a set of rules in
order to perpetuate the genre. Instead, they rely on a set of guidelines
formed around experiences with the traumatic intersections of obsolesce and
the new, futility and hopefulness, sickness and cure, fracturing our
expectations for their resolution.

	Unlike Goofy on the dance floor in <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5QTaaqBhXY&amp;feature=related"
target="_blank">Firehouse Five + Two</a>, comics expect to be unprepared for
the traumatic event, or better, predict the traumatic event because the genre
knows it’s coming; it has to, that’s how the medium works after all, and
makes for the dance floor legs akimbo coping with the trauma of its own
obsolescence as only it can—by representing trauma.

Kirkman’s “The Walking Dead” is, at first glance, a tough sell for those
readers not interested in the zombie / horror / post-apocalyptic genre of
storytelling – many are affronted by the concept, recalling its gory
predecessors with hollow plotlines that centred solely on survival and left
little room for character development. Trying to push the text on others has
been a challenge, and my attempts at defining the nuances of what makes the
long running comics’ series so worthwhile are typically met with “but still,
zombies aren’t my thing.” “The Walking Dead,” however, from its outset defied
all genre expectations and has continued to do so for nearly a hundred issues
and counting. It is a character-driven story that problematizes the
experience of being human in ways that few texts are capable of
accomplishing.

	At first, trauma in “The Walking Dead” may appear to be a no brainer (pun
intended). We have characters who are subjected to the horror of reanimated
corpses (who are often friends and loved ones), who are physically and
emotionally distraught at every turn, who are left without the common social
structures which we normally turn to for support in times of crisis. Left in
an apparently godless world ruled by the dead who are roaming in search of
living, human flesh to feed on, the broad strokes of the series seem to
embody the entire horror genre tha<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/cover.jpg"><
img class="alignleft  wp-image-1539"

jpg" alt="" width="297" height="225" /></a>t preceded it, accessing the most
basic of human impulses of fight or flight. This, however, is only the
surface trauma that the characters experience, and Kirkman is unfathomably
deft in showcasing what psychological trauma actually is through the
survivors of his zombie apocalypse.

	The trauma inherent in “The Walking Dead” comes not from the zombies
themselves, but from the human characters as they learn to cope with one
another (and themselves) in their raggedy band of survival – the title itself
is here an interesting pun, as it’s the humans who are truly the walking
dead, bereft of their personalities and their former social selves. These
characters, facing nearly insurmountable and horrific challenges, have to
reinvent themselves in Kirkman’s post-apocalyptic world in which the simp<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lorishot.jpg"
><img class="alignright  wp-image-1540"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lorishot-
189x300.jpg" alt="" width="189" height="300" /></a>le experience of being
human carries very different connotations than it does in our own. Rick, the
group’s leader, consistently struggles (at least early on in the series) with
the greatness that has been thrust upon him; he has to rise up to the
expectations of his group in ensuring their safety, all the while incapable
of resisting the guilt that comes from so many having died under his
protection, including his best friend (killed by his son who was protecting
him) and his wife and newborn baby daughter. Similarly, Rick’s pregnant Lori
had to toil with the decision of bringing a life into a world in which there
was little to no hope for even her survival – which was ultimately a losing
battle. “The Walking Dead” tests its characters with the intensity of social
roles in a new, concentrated dynamic, challenging what it means to be a
leader, to be a mother, in the stress of the most extreme situations
imaginable.

	Though the story sees its characters faced with the expected challenges
of the zombie genre, it’s in their human struggles that we see them in the
most pain – Rick experiences far more loss when facing down the barrel of a
gun held by Shane, his best friend and whom he has discovered has been
sleeping with his<a

300x150.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="150" /></a> wife during his absence,
than he does on being attacked by endless hordes of the undead. Likewise,
Michonne is most traumatized not by zombies, but by her vicious rape at the
hands of the Governor. The most brutal vignettes that Kirkman gives us
throughout the series never actually involve zombies, but what we are capable
of doing to each other when all of the chips are down (and they’re never more
down than after a zombie apocalypse). The scenes during which we feel most
for these characters are during their human encounters which have been
heightened due to their impossible environment.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/carlshoots.
jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1544"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/carlshoots-
300x226.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a>When the social world of
bills and taxes has been stripped away, the travails that these characters
experience are amplified because they’re all in the process of rediscovering
who they are, and redefining what it means to be human in the absence of the
trivialities that consume our daily existences. “The Walking Dead” shows us
the trauma of what real human life actually means when it’s been divorced of
all of the mundane functions that we must attend to on a daily basis, begging
the reader to similarly question what kind of person he or she is at the core
– and ultimately be afraid of answering that question. The zombies act as a
backdrop, little more than an irregularly occurring motif in the series that
focuses intensely on character development and situational redevelopment.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/hope.jpg"><
img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1546"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/hope-216x300.
jpg" alt="" width="216" height="300" /></a>Despite all of the pain and loss,
however, Kirkman ultimately offers us hope: the extremity of the environment
also serves to heighten the emotional connection that the characters feel for
one another. These characters, in the face of the same impending death that
we all face (via zombies or otherwise), experience life, friendships and love
in a way that only those fully aware of their own mortality are capable of.
In recognizing that we are all the walking dead, we can experience what it
really means to be alive. The trauma of true human existence, stripped of its
facades, is punctuated in the series by equally profound moments of joy in
the ability to see another day and to face it together. “The Walking Dead”
offers us an entrypoint into an unfettered reality with realistic characters
and an impossible situation, and it’s in this that Kirkman’s narrative
transcends the typical zombie survival story: in facing immanent death, he
reminds us, and often surprises us, with what it truly means to be human.

	In previous posts we have addressed the issues in comics of continuity,
retconning, and the radical alternation of drawing and colouring styles to
indicate different sorts of worlds. All of these issues illuminate the force
that the history of comics exerts over creators. Chris Ware cannot separate
his own work from the legacy of Superman in <em>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest
Kid on Earth</em>. Ed Brubaker engages with Archie in <em>Fatale: Last of the
Innocent</em>. Every writer and artist who works on <em>Superman</em>,
<em>Batman</em>, <em>Spiderman</em> or any of the other franchise books at DC
and Marvel feels the weight of past incarnations of the characters on their
shoulders. In issues 11 and 12 of <em>The Sandman</em>, Neil Gaiman engages
with previous Sandman incarnations in order to assert his own power over the
title, just as within the narrative Dream (or Morpheus) must assert his
authority over the Dreaming, having been imprisoned for so long. While
Gaiman's approach to his predecessors is playful, even mocking, he ultimately
returns his power to the DC empire, like Prospero breaking his staff at the
end of the Tempest.

	In issues 11 and 12 we meet the 1974 version of the Simon/Kirby
<em>Sandman</em>, appropriately enough in the dream of Jed Walker. In that
<em>Sandman</em>, the hero protects Jed from nightmares and the traumas of
reality by controlling his dreams. In issue 11, the story of Rose Walker
moving into a shared house in San Francisco is interrupted by a page that
looks like it is from a different comic. A ribbon banner at the top of the
page announces: "In the Land of Marvelous Dreams." On that page, the Sandman
and a white-haired, pregnant woman take Jed by the hands and they fly, until
"the skooky bird," a white bird released by two ugly figures in a hot air
balloon, tickles Jed's hands and he falls.

	The page has a fantasy, fairytale quality. It looks like a page from a
comic for children, in stark contrast to the horror story that surrounds it.
The language of the page is stilted, largely due to the absence of
contractions: "Do not let go of my hand, Jed. Or you will fall." "Oh no! It
is the skooky bird." The phrasing sounds archaic and unnatural. So when we
get to the transitional, final panel on the page, in which the dream Jed
shifts to real Jed, we are shocked: "Shut up you little bastard! Or I'll
really give you something to scream about!" Jed's uncle screams at him.
Gaiman thus stresses the radical generic and stylistic alterity of his
version of <em>The Sandman</em> relative to previous versions. <em>The
Sandman</em> comics of the past appear innocent, removed from reality, and
the stuff of nostalgia. The world of Gaiman's <em>Sandman</em>, however, is
serious, dangerous, and psychologically traumatic. Gaiman thus co-opts the
history of <em>The Sandman</em> to show us how far the medium has come, not
only since 1942 when the first Kirby/Simon <em>Sandman</em> appeared, but
since the 1970s and 1980s as well. Of course, we can locate Gaiman's
<em>Sandman</em> within a period aesthetic of its own. Morpheus looks like a
version of The Cure's Robert Smith, a period Goth.

	In "inheriting" <em>The Sandman</em>, Gaiman does not have to deal with
the weighty past of a <em>Superman</em> or <em>Batman</em>. Simon and Kirby
may have been great creators of comics, but <em>The Sandman</em> is a
relative light-weight. After all, this is a superhero who helps Santa Claus
in one issue. Indeed, the prior incarnation of The Sandman in Gaiman's verson
appears hyberbolic and idiotic: "Say guys, do you think this nightmare
monster is gonna be a tougher battle than the skeleton men from Pluto? Do
you? Do you?" Norman Mailer called Gaiman's <em>Sandman</em> "a comic book
for intellectuals;" but Gaiman obviously does not feel the same way about his
predecessors.

	Nevertheless, Gaiman takes Simon and Kirby's second version of <em>The
Sandman</em>, in which the title character monitors and regulates dreams, as
raw material for his own work. He takes what is essentially a cheesy story
and turns it into a masterwork. For instance, we learn that Brute and Glob,
the Sandman's nightmare assistants from the second Simon and Kirby go round
of the title, have hijacked the dead Hector Hall and have turned him into a
sort of Sandman placeholder as they try to gain control over The Dreaming
while Morpheus has been held captive for 70 years. Morpheus has to put his
world back in order, and part of that project is usurping the continuity of
<em>The Sandman</em> of the past and asserting his own vision.

	However, Gaiman also returns the franchise to the DC universe when he is
done with it. The white-haired pregnant woman in the "In the Land of
Marvellous Dreams" page is Hyppolyta "Lyta" Trevor, daughter of Wonder Woman
in one DC continuity and daughter of Fury in another. While Hector Hall is
the biological father of the fetus Lyta carries, Morpheus is in a way his
spiritual father, and Daniel Hall, Lyta's son becomes the new Dream when
Morpheus dies. Thus Gaiman, having taken the Dreaming hostage for 75 issues
and bending it all out of shape, politely gives it back. After a strange and
wonderful deviation, normal programming resumes. Like Morpheus himself,
Gaiman's run of <em>The Sandman</em> occupies a liminal space, between the
generic constraints and conventions of mass market comics conventions and a
complex literary imaginative space. When we read it, we lose track of the
distinctions, entering a hypnagogic state.

Skulls" metaphor is one that runs deep in comics. [Turns out it runs deep in
a lot of things: <a
href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingButSkulls"
target="_blank">check this out.</a> Eds.] It certainly represents the
standard metaphors of death, power, and enslavement within the stories in
which it appears. However, the metaphor seems especially powerful in comics
as a representation of the creative act or, more appropriately, the fears
associated with the introduction of the new. As heavily populated with
intertextuality as comics are, they are also an emerging medium with space
for inventive story-lines and characters. The difficulty for practioners is
how to tell the new story without offending the sensibilities of the genre.
For such a young medium, comics carry an incredible weight in terms of the
genre's history, expectations, and formal requirements. Every artist draws on
a palimpsest of bodies and skulls--historical, literary, and artistic--no
matter the subject / story. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/maus_bodies.

src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/maus_bodies.
png" alt="" width="472" height="335" /></a></p> Just as Hamlet searches for
answers to an ambiguous world in his conversations with Yorick's skull, the
Jester who he "once knew," comic book authors seem to address their forbears.
It's not a consistently straight-up allusion, but a weighted one that carries
with it the pressures of being the antecedent. On the one hand, the skull
provides guidance and council, asserting themes, tropes, and formal
expectation and on the other hand, the skull (a jester's after all; shadows
of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yellow_Kid"
target="_blank">Yellow Kid</a>) mocks the artist for his derivative approach
(as a comic book fan might).

	Appearing in <em>The Doll’s House</em> section of Gaiman’s
<em>Sandman</em> series, The Corinthian is an apt example of the wrestling
comic book artists seem to do with the conventions—loose though they may
be—of the genre. The Corinthian’s speech to the Cereal Convention in “The
Collectors” is reminiscent of a manifesto on the art of comics, or at the
very least, its paradigms for expression—the speech is a metaphor here
remember, so don’t let all this talk of killing fool you; comic book artists
are all "entrepreneurs in an expanding field." <p style="text-align:
center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/corinth_weare
.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1569" title="corinth_weare"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/corinth_weare.
png" alt="" width="287" height="210" /></a></p> <p style="text-align:
left;">The Corinthian's taste for the "eyes of young boys" further points the
alert reader in the direction of metaphors for artistic creativity in the
comic book. Comic books are traditionally--and perhaps always will be--hungry
for the eyes of young boys. Even a rudimentary scan of comics' history will
reveal the situations upon which the merits of horror / murder / sexual
plot-lines were weighed and outlawed for fear of corrupting the eyes of young
boys. With that in mind, Dream's declarations about his intentions for The
Corinthian reflect a nervousness with the creative act; an uncertainty about
the merits of the creation itself in the face of its purpose. All of which is
the classic dialogue between the creator and the creation.</p> <p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/
corinth_create.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1570"
title="corinth_create"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/corinth_create
.png" alt="" width="390" height="605" /></a></p> <p style="text-align:
left;">The duality of both being blind and yet seeing clearly is another
aspect of The Corinthian that deserves attention given its clear allusion to
the role of reader. The willing suspension of disbelief is a universal
component of becoming immersed in the kind of story Gaiman is putting forward
in <em>Sandman</em>. The parallels between the "dream state" and the "state
of reading" are drawn clearly in the tropes of the series, particularly as it
continues to unfold. Here, as we read through the dual representation of the
anxiety of authorship and the vile actions of a murderer, we are both seeing
and suspending--seeing some things clearly while choosing not to see others
at all--because the act of interpreting both the storyline and its metaphoric
layers requires that we reject one in the service of understanding the
other.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">In <em>The Doll's House</em> episode,
The Corinthian is represented within a fairly transparent metaphor for the
cereal (vis: comic book) convention, as an all-star:</p> <p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/corinth_fans.
png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1571" title="corinth_fans"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/corinth_fans.
png" alt="" width="397" height="403" /></a></p> <p style="text-align:
left;">At the same time, the anxiety of authorship emerges as, despite his
all-star status, The Corinthian's credentials are required and must be
prominently displayed. The Corinthian--or the metaphor for authorship--is
both anonymous and infamous; both friend and potential foe; he is both seen
and unseen. At a convention where a large man with a mustache asks, "The
Devil? Uh, would that be the Kentucky Devil, or the Oregon Devil? I got both
here" (Gaiman 14.4) and one conventioneer exclaims, "The TV version? The TV
version butchered it! But I hear you can get it uncut on video in Canada"
(Gaiman 14.4), we find the anxiety of the comic book author on full display
as The Corinthian in a room full of authorities of the genre. Moreover, there
is a deep allusion to the dreamworld itself, which is both "seen" in the
sleeping mind, bit "unseen" in the conventions of waking daylight.</p> <p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/
Corinth_collect.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1572"
title="Corinth_collect"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/
Corinth_collect.png" alt="" width="371" height="278" /></a></p> <p
style="text-align: left;">As the above suggests however, The Dream seems to
assert that a new age is upon us. Another symbolic allusion associated with
the comic book genre, that of collecting or, historicization, is itself
rejected. In a transformative moment, the true author of dreams emerges to
vanquish the impostor (or, perhaps, the traditionalist looking for easy
re-imaginings)--exchanging the comfort of daydreams for realities. The
Dream's final words on his creation are, "The next time I make you, you shall
not be so flawed and petty, little dream" (Gaiman 14.36). Itself a caveat for
a renewed creative / aesthetic paradigm, the soliloquy ties together the
numerous symbolic lines let out throughout the course of the narrative.
Perhaps an assertion to probe deeper levels of story-telling in the medium, a
call to reject conventions in favour of renewal, the end of The Corinthian
signals the beginning of something new.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Corin_death.
png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1573" title="Corin_death"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Corin_death.
png" alt="" width="224" height="185" /></a></p> <p style="text-align:
left;">When The Corinthian is "uncreated," the metaphoric skull re-appears
and with it all the allusions--literal, historical, generic--that suggest
tensions between the new and the traditional. Gaiman's <em>Sandman</em> then
becomes a commentary on the nature of the creative act as it applies to comic
books, with its own generic conventions that are hard to break and
its iconographic metaphors that are fluid and individual. The final reading
suggests that making comics is about "uncreating" rather than creating, a way
out of established conventions and into that liminal somnambulance (please,
if you're a student, do not use the previous phrase, ever) that allows
connections to be drawn without the logic or anxiety associated with their
connection. The artistic voice awakens to drown.</p> <p style="text-align:

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Continuing Neil Gaiman
month here at Graphixia, I'm pretty excited to talk about <em>Marvel
1602</em>, an eight-issue series penned by Gaiman and published in 2003.  It
won both a 2005 Quill Award and 2003's Worst Comic of the Year rating from
Time Magazine, so it's a controversial title and certainly not one that
appeals to everyone.  But I really enjoyed it, particularly as someone who
likes to talk about September 11 and its cultural impact -- because 9/11 is
all over this book.

	In the Afterword to the trade paper edition of <em>1602</em>, Gaiman
discusses how after September 11, he didn't want to write a traditional
Marvel storyline with explosions and death and war.  He wanted to do
something different -- but still needed the conflict and tension that war
stories provide for comics.  So he went back in time to 1602, setting the
Marvel characters in an England under Queen Elizabeth, now aged and dying.
 Elizabeth doesn't love the mutants -- she doesn't know quite what to make of
them, and she's concerned by their powers -- but as British subjects, she
seeks to protect and tolerate them, even as the Spanish Inquisition hunt them
as witchborn.

	But James is coming to power, and he hates himself some witchborn, so the
mutants are undercover and on the run.

	(I find this choice really interesting, given that the opposite was
basically true for Catholics at the time and instead of having the mutants at
odds with the Pope, Gaiman could have had the mutant experience acting as
analogous to non-Protestant experience in England; instead, the rising power
of Catholics in England is absolutely the worst thing that could happen to
the mutants.)

	Just as Marvel's <em>Civil War</em> was all about anxiety around power
and authority in the post-9/11 era, either with us or against us era,
<em>1602</em> is ultimately a comic informed by immediate post-9/11 anxieties
and fears.  The thrust of the comic centres around being able to change
history -- to go back and fix a wrong that has been committed.  It's also
about America as the space of freedom: the mutants eventually must flee to
Roanoake to find a space where they can escape the tyranny of King James
(America, we are unsubtly told, has no need for the machinations of kings and
queens).  And finally, its about wishing and hoping for someone to intervene
in the tragedies of the present, in the form of Marvel's Watchers.

	The Watchers are here, in this series, and what makes them interesting in
<em>1602</em> is their willingness to betray their own policy of
non-interference.  The Watchers exist in the Marvel universe but typically
they do not meddle.  Here, in this post-9/11 historical space, they do
meddle.  They repair the Earth so it may continue.  That the Watchers lift a
hand here is typical of post-9/11 art that seeks to show a hand out there,
somewhere, that can and will intervene on our behalf and protect us from
trauma.  The Watchers are ambivalent about their choice to act, but they do
it -- and the sense of resolve in the series and its happy ending suggest
this was the right choice.

	<em>Marvel 1602</em> is an interesting read; the art is beautiful, and as
with all alternate histories, if you've put your time in as a Marvel fan
there are a lot of in-jokes for you.  It feels too easy, the resolution --
too quick and too straightforward -- but as a product of its temporal moment,
that makes sense.

	Also, one time it was on Jeopardy:

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Neil Gaiman is one of
those rare triple-threats of the publishing industry – he is an accomplished
New York Times bestselling novelist, a successful author of children’s books
as well as one of the most lauded comics writers in the industry. Though his
canon in this latter medium is rife with excellent recent material (the
“Eternals,” for example, or the miniseries “1602” that Brenna discussed last
week), it’s difficult to avoid his much celebrated Sandman series as the
defining triumph of Gaiman’s career. Sandman speaks to us because of <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SandmanPandN.
jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1606"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SandmanPandN-
200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>the universalities that it
evokes through its central characters of the Endless: anthropomorphic
constructs of the features that define us as a species. Gaiman uses Sandman
as a vehicle for his lofty ideas, drawing equally on literary allusion,
conventions of horror and fantasy as well as classical mythology in order to
drive his storytelling, keeping the eponymous character often in the
background to pursue interests that are peripheral to the concerns of the
central narrative. The result is that, by the close of Sandman’s run, Gaiman
offers his readers a fictional universe that is nearly beyond comparison in
its depth, and his tone gives the work a feeling of timelessness – it is
often easy to lose oneself in the high-minded abstractions that the Sandman
evokes. However, these aspects of his work only take shape in his later
volumes, as in his opening collection, “Preludes and Nocturnes,” we see a
very different Gaiman than the confident visionary that he is often described
as.

	Prior to Sandman, Gaiman had only written one other mainstream comic
book: “Black Orchid,” a prestige format, three-issue miniseries, which he
wrote with his then-recent collaborator Dave McKean (who would later paint
all of the covers for Sandman’s seventy-five issue run). British-born Gaiman
has admitted, however, that he was apprehensive about beginning a career in
writing US comics, unsure of his ability to write superheroes or even work
within North American culture in crafting his narratives; as he notes in an
interview, he was part of a “generation in the UK who’d grown up reading DC
comics from a bizarre perspective. In America, those comics were perceived
without irony; in England, they were like postcards from another world. The
idea of a place that looked like New York, the idea of fire hydrants and
pizzerias, was just as strange to us as the idea that anyone would wear a
cape and fly over them” (qtd in Bender 21). It is largely because of this
that Gaiman elected to work with the least known of DC’s cast of characters,
concentrating more on his focus of fantasy and mythology by requesting the
Phantom Stranger and the Demon. Thankfully for us, even these characters were
reserved for more well-known authors, and Gaiman was rejected and left with
reinventing a little-known character from the Golden Age for his first
attempt at a monthly book.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Sandman1.jpg"
><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1607"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Sandman1.jpg"
alt="" width="272" height="186" /></a>These first issues of the Sandman, for
a reader familiar with the DC universe, show great trepidation in entering
such a large universe with demanding expectations. Though he has mentioned in
later interviews that he enjoyed working with Sandman so much because it
“freed [him] from the baggage of DC continuity,” (qtd in Bender 24), the
consistent (though subtle) references to both contemporary works and current
events in the DCU show that Gaiman was quite concerned with positioning
himself inside of this larger dynamic, often in a highly self-conscious way.
Even the central premise of the story, Morpheus having been trapped by mortal
magic for seven decades, stems from the desire to explain why so important a
character has not been present in the DCU up until the point that Gaiman
constructs him – Gaiman effectively writes Sandman into continuity ostensibly
by writing him out of it, explaining away the absence of a significant
character he intends to be a major player in future crossovers, a literary
trick that his since been replicated by the likes of, among others, Brian
Michael Bendis in his highly popular Marvel character the Sentry. Though we
now think of Sandman as having kickstarted DC’s Vertigo imprint through a
confident construction of an entirely new universe, Gaiman was actually
catering to the conventions of the superhero comic and attempting to
fabricate a place in it for both himself as well as his creation.

	This happens at several other points in Preludes and Nocturnes, notably
in the guest role that John Constantine plays, a character that Gaiman
borrowed from Alan Moore’s “Swamp Thing.” On breaking into an office to find
Morpheus’ lost pouch of sand, Constantine encounters a run of texts in a
drawer, one of which is titled “Crisis.” (90) <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/
SandmanCrisis1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1612"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SandmanCrisis1
.jpg" alt="" width="645" height="181" /></a>This nod, lost to readers of the
reprinted graphic novel, was a direct reference to the changing nature of the
DCU at the time and the company's “Crisis on Infinite Earths.” The following
issue, Gaiman incorporates Etrigan, a DC character who he’d been told in his
early dealings with DC that he wasn’t allowed to write for because he didn’t
have a large enough name in the industry at that point. His inclusion of the
character, to one familiar with Gaiman’s history with DC, shows that the
writer was bent on asserting himself as a strong voice within the American
comics market very early on in his career.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SandmanMM2.
jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1617"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SandmanMM2.jpg
" alt="" width="433" height="690" /></a>Moreover, in the later issues of
Preludes and Nocturnes, Gaiman shoehorns in more mainstream DC characters in
the then-recently revamped Justice League, making brief mention of the
restructuring of the team due to the events spinning out of “Crisis.”
Interestingly, Gaiman shows Martian Manhunter’s familiarity with the Sandman
even though other DC characters do not know who he is – the Manhunter, one of
the most powerful characters in the DCU with a long running history, drops to
his knees in fealty to Gaiman’s creation (146). This is quite clearly
Gaiman’s attempt at giving his Sandman some credibility in the DCU,
highlighting the import of his characters only a few issues in to his new
series even though, as readers, we’re just being introduced to them now.
While the story of Sandman takes front and centre in these early issues, in
the subtext and nuances one can see the workings of a fledgling artist
attempting to establish himself in a marketplace that is quite cloistered and
bent on nepotism – it is notoriously difficult to get a start in the comics
publishing industry (particularly with the big two) without first knowing
someone who has already achieved success.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/
SandmanArkham1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1620"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SandmanArkham1
-113x300.jpg" alt="" width="113" height="300" /></a>We can see elements of
this nepotism at work in the early issues of Sandman as well. Gaiman’s
partner, Dave McKean, had been assigned the role of artist for Grant
Morrison’s “Arkham Asylum” hardcover graphic novel in order to build up a
reputation for the release of Gaiman and McKean’s “Black Orchid” miniseries,
released in tandem with the first few issues of the Sandman. McKean, as new
to the American comics market as Gaiman, needed all the promotion that he
could get, and Gaiman was happy to contribute to the cause – the final three
issues of Preludes and Nocturnes feature Arkham as an important setting for
the events of his story, as Doctor Destiny escapes from the madhouse and is
eventually brought back there for punishment. The illustrations and text draw
particular attention to the Asylum itself at multiple points in the narrative
(209). Featuring Arkham in this way not only allowed Gaiman to support a
friend and a fellow UK unknown, it also contributed to Gaiman’s own success
as McKean had signed on to do all of Gaiman’s covers for Sandman: an attempt
at cross pollination that proved to be very effective for both of them.

	Though the Sandman proved to be a very important and highly studied
series over its seven-year run, in its beginnings, a reader who is familiar
with the workings of the DCU at the time and the machinations (and sometimes
ostracizing qualities) of the American publishing industry giants can see the
underlying forceful attempts of a new author struggling to make a name for
himself in a challenging new milieu. One could argue, as Gaiman sometimes
hints at himself, that this entire first run had far less to do with crafting
an interesting story than it did openly establishing Gaiman as a new voice in
the comics market, a feat accomplished through narrative trickery and
inclusion of references that incorporate his work into the larger universe of
familiar characters and summer events. Though Gaiman is now considered a
force unto himself in both universes offered by the big two publishers, a
look at his less auspicious beginnings and early forays into the industry
show that he is not only a talented writer but an adept marketer of his and
his friends’ work, eager to make a name for himself in whichever artistic
field he decides to participate in.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Disclaimer: I am only
part way through <em>20th Century Boys</em> and my fragmentary comments on
the series reflect this partial reading.

	Naoki Urasawa's <em>20th Century Boys</em> presents the fate of a group
of young friends in 1969 who effectively write the future. From their secret
base, they create a fantasy in which they rescue the world from evil threats
like germ warfare, laser guns, and giant robots. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-
2012-05-28-at-9.12.48-PM.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1629"
title="Screen Shot 2012-05-28 at 9.12.48 PM"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-
2012-05-28-at-9.12.48-PM.png" alt="" width="486" height="437" /></a>When two
bullies, Yanbo and Mabo, destroy the base towards the end of summer, Kenji,
the group leader, decides that it is time to put fantasy aside and do
homework in preparation for the upcoming school year. And that's the last of
the fantasy, until the boys are adults, thoroughly enmeshed in reality, all
hopes of heroic action dissipated. Kenji runs a liquor/convenience store, and
is saddled with the care of his missing sister's daughter. Kenji's friends
have similarly mundane occupations. A wedding of one of the boys is an early
event. The groom, Keroyon, says, "Kenji, you guys are gettin' old now! You
gotta get yourself settled down" (2.6) Thus, <em>20th Century Boys</em>
begins with the concept of subjectification, the point at which a person
gives up on childish fantasies of power and significance and integrates with
the grown-up world. In his speech at Keroyon's wedding, Kenji talks about
this reduction in expectation: "Maybe now Keroyon-Kun can now protect the
peace of his household or the neighborhood" now that the dream of protecting
the world from evil has passed (2.15).

	But just at this point, the childhood fantasy re-asserts itself. Kenji
spots a strangely familiar icon, the boy's symbol of friendship, as graffiti
on a fence. One of the group, Donkey, dies suspiciously, having sent Kenji a
note about the icon. And a mysterious figure named "Friend" has adopted the
icon for his cult. Soon, utopian childhood fantasy becomes dystopian present
that demands heroic action from Kenji and his friends. In this sense,
Urusawa's plot has something of the superhero narrative about it, and the
scenario plays upon the similar concerns about being an ordinary person with
limited capability of acting in or upon the world whose problems seem
insurmountable even when cities are not being terrorized by science fiction
monsters. As a sort of internal allegory, A homeless man with a bowling
obsession, nick-named "God," appears to have visionary power. His abilities
in relation to his social situation represent an extreme version of Kenji's.

	That the story begins in 1969, the year of Woodstock is significant
because the narrative uses rock and roll as a metaphor for meaning in the
world. The title comes from the T-Rex song, and Kenji has had aspirations to
rock stardom. When Kenji's sister buys him a guitar when he is a teenager, he
looks at himself in the mirror and sees himself as a hero with a weapon: the
electric guitar as phallus.<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-

2012-05-28-at-9.06.13-PM.png" alt="" width="576" height="790" /></a>

	The rock musician is a twentieth-century analogue of the mythical hero.
The image of Kenji in the mirror as "invincible man" (18.13) gives way to the
image of the man from the convenience store head office, who represents
everything that unmans Kenji, telling him that he has to stop carrying around
his sister's baby on his back because it is putting off customers. Kenji's
failure in this realm is emblematic, perhaps, of his status as a warrior. He
requires redemption. And yet this redemption demands a re-configuring of the
masculine hero, the exchange of the phallic but ultimately ineffective guitar
for the niece Kenji carries on his back and cares for is not an emasculating
one. Rather, it is the link between Kenji's individual acceptance of
responsibility for his world, a responsibility that the return of childhood
fantasy as malevolent force magnifies.

	That the force the group must fight as adults is associated with
friendship and that their enemy goes by the name of Friend gets at the root
of what Urasawa is doing with the theme of nostalgia. The bond of friendship
defines the childhood of these characters, and adulthood threatens that bond.
Other bonds, like marriage, become more significant. Because "Friend" uses
the icon that symbolized the childhood group, Kenji and the others believe
that he must be one of them. An early suspect is Otcho, who has gone missing
in India and Thailand, but Otcho turns up and works with Kenji. Otcho is
interesting because he actually has a heroic persona; he gets Zen training in
India and rescues prostitutes in Thailand. He earns the nickname "Shogun."
But he is who he is because he has neglected marriage and fatherhood and has
had to pay the price. Although Friend is ultimately identified as one of the
boys, Fukubei, it is perhaps best to think of him as a psychological entity,
the spectre of childhood friendship in adulthood, returning from the
repressed to torment the boys with their failures.

	In keeping with the theme of repression, there's a lot of digging up of
the buried past in the early going of <em>20th Century Boys</em>: Kenji and
his friends unearth a time capsule that they buried as children. Kenji ends
up hiding underground with the homeless guys, earning the moniker "Kenji the
underground emperor," which is itself a kind of backhanded way of pointing
out his insignificance.<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-

	The idea of 'being someone' drives the idea of nostalgia. We yearn for
our youths because we were able to imagine ourselves as central figures in an
engaging story, not just peripheral make-weights. Our yearning is not so much
for the idyll but for the power that went with it. We had a secret base; our
imaginary adventures were meaningful. We felt the ominous threats of the
world in the form of bullies. Like Donkey, who runs especially fast when he
takes off his shoes, we had special powers bestowed upon us by our
imaginations. In adulthood, we cannot sustain those powers. We know too much
about the mundane world we occupy to imagine ourselves rock stars, heroes, or
even villains.

	Urasawa's vision is a stunning one. For he not only presents a "science
fiction" narrative in images, but also provides a kind of analysis of why
such a narrative is necessary from a historical, psychological perspective.
Like all good science fiction, 20th Century Boys is less about escapism than
it is about confronting our history by projecting it into the future, where
we see what we might look like through the lens of what we imagined ourselves
to be.

lightbox="off"]Canadian comic book practitioner Seth is well-known for his
forays into false histories. His <em>It's A Good Life If You Don't
Weaken</em> was so spot on in its representation of the author's search for a
long lost <em>New Yorker</em> cartoonist that it fooled a lot of people into
believing it was a true story. What makes Seth's representations of such
false histories so authentic is his ability to render the nostalgic, or the
emotional connection to a lost idealized moment. What's interesting about
this creative practice is that Seth's "idealized moment" is itself fictional;
the moment isn't actually lost, because it never was. <p style="text-align:
center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/seth_trudeau.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1665" title="seth_trudeau"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/seth_trudeau-
805x1024.jpg" alt="" width="483" height="614" /></a></p> Among his many fine
skills mentioned above, Seth also works to construct physical manifestations
of the fictional world he creates. These object sketches, I suspect,
themselves lend an air of authenticity for the author and help one imagine
the actual physical space occupied by the fictional "Dominion City," which
frequently stands as the story's backdrop. Seth's penchant for building
physical objects, sometimes trophies and bits of clothing to accompany the
buildings, points us toward a key facet for his evolving representation of
idealized moments that, taken together, help to create a sense of nostalgia
in the reader.  <a

src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/seth_tophat-
300x297.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="297" /></a>  Beginning with <em>Clyde
Fans</em> (serialized in the <em>Palookaville</em> series) and continuing
into the recently published <em>The G. N. B. Double C</em>, Seth relies on a
narrative structure in which the speaker / narrator of the story walks about
describing different objects and their relevance. In Seth's work, the comic
becomes a space for displaying different artifacts with the narrator
supplying the necessary context. The comic becomes a museum for an idealized
past (which never existed). As we move through the narrative, we learn the
fate and/or history of the objects the narrator encounters.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/seth_wolf_01.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1668" title="seth_wolf_01"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/seth_wolf_01-
300x131.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="131" /></a>  These objects take on
emotional resonance in Seth's work for two primary reasons: their scarcity
and their importance to understanding the larger narrative. In essence, the
objects are important because they mean something to the narrator, but they
also mean something to the reader because there is a discovery awaiting--one
in which the narrator or narrative is privileged to know (just like in a
detective narrative).  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/seth_wolf_02.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1669" title="seth_wolf_02"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/seth_wolf_02-
300x244.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="244" /></a>  Perhaps the most
important aspect of the objects in Seth's stories is their state of decay.
It's a general statement, but the object's state of decay is also indicative
of how idealized the narrator's version of the past has become. The
narrator's reaction--usually emotional--to the object's state of decay calls
up the resistance to the passing of time that usually accompanies the
nostalgic exhibit of idealized moments.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/seth_headless
.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1671"
title="seth_headless"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/seth_headless-
240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" /></a>  In Seth's work, the
object is what allows the narrator to mine the emotional resonance that comes
with loss and its nostalgic recovery. Nostalgia is then expressed not as a
longing for an idealized past, but as a particular historical sequence, which
is, as is the case with most memories viewed through the nostalgic lens,
entirely fictional.  All this suggests a powerful polemic at play in Seth's
work. Comics collectors and practioners expend a great deal of energy
accumulating and representing the cultural capital of comics without
justification. Sure, the histrionics of Superman, or even the Holocaust as
represented in other formats, are essential components of the medium's
creative possibilities. However, the intensely personal perspectives that lie
behind those historiographies--hence the common turn to memoir--suggest that
the comic's past so often referenced, built upon, and expanded results from
an essentially nostalgic viewpoint. Every comic is at its root a walk through
the practioner's nostalgic encounters with the medium. For Seth, the power of
comics is not in the objects--the comic books themselves--but in the
narrators' description of them; in the stories they tell. Comics history,
then, is a deeply personal one, often stained with the a nostalgia that
attempts to assign value to that which was produced to be disposable.  Work

of Comics Fans</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignleft"
src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00978/Beano-today_978351c.
jpg" alt="" width="460" height="288" />It's fitting that we're doing
nostalgia month while I'm teaching a field school in Wales, because in a lot
of ways this return to the UK, my first since I was about 15, has been all
about nostalgia for me.  And conveniently, that nostalgia is all wrapped up
in comic books -- and sweets, and sugary drinks, and other trappings of
childhood -- so here I am.

	This post is all about <em>The Beano</em>, a comic book published weekly
since 1938 (with a brief break due to a shortage of supplies in WWII), having
published 3500 issues as of 2009.  The comic includes the regular adventures
of characters like Dennis the Menace, Mini the Minx, the Bash Street Kids,
Lord Snooty (since phased out), the Numbskulls, and Roger the Dodger.  The
individual strips are usually stand-alone comics, with the exception of some
occasional through-lines.  As a result, like any long-running series
(<em>Archie</em> comes to mind), there is occasional repetition of storylines
or ideas, but as generations move through comics (like <em>Archie</em>, the
readership for <em>The Beano</em> is primarily children and young teenagers),
this doesn't really matter.  The Grand Comis Database has loads of issues
logged <a href="http://www.comics.org/series/11285/">here</a>.

	The first thing I did when I got here, once the students were settled and
I was over the jet lag, was find a newsagents where I could buy (a) <em>The
Beano</em> and (b) candy.  I have fond memories of my grandfather going out
early in the mornings to retrieve both for me.  <em>The Beano</em> looks a
little different than I remember it -- it is glossy now, instead of the old
stick-to-your-hands newsprint of yore, and the characters are a little
slicker in the way contemporary Spider-Man looks slicker than 1960s
Spider-Man, but the essence remains the same.  So much the same, in fact,
that I realized just how much you cannot go home again when it comes to
comics: the gags I once found hilarious are no longer funny.  I am, in fact,
an adult.  Boo.

	This realization got me thinking about the role nostalgia plays in
keeping long-running comics series going.  As children, do we stumble upon
comics ourselves or through referral, being purchased issues by parents or
older siblings who have vetted these series from their own experiences?  And
when we look back at the comics from our youth, do they hold up?  Thinking
back to our series on early Spider-Man, one would say no -- the naive
idealism and cheeseball fights come to mind.  And yet adult readers do find
something in contemporary retellings of Spider-Man, which is a title that
seems to have reinvented itself regularly to maintain relevancy.  Even
<em>Archie</em> has busily kept up with the times, making itself
issue-oriented recently in order to grab both press and market share.

	<em>The Beano</em>, however, seems to have made a conscious choice to
stay locked in a particular version of youth: fart jokes and puns, practical
jokes from the 1950s, stay-at-home moms and strict tie-bedecked dads. 
There's a comic included in this issue from 1982, and it doesn't seem any
different or removed from the comics in the rest of the issue.  And that's
not to say there's not a place for this particular brand of nostalgia; the
series seems to hearken back to an England that doesn't exist anymore (if it
ever really did).  But it's an interesting choice for a comic to make in an
era of contemporary appeal.  And it means there's very little for an adult
reader to connect to.

	This in and of itself is interesting. As a viewer or reader, I tend to
privilege children's entertainment that operates on multiple levels, engaging
with an adult audience alongside its child one. <em>The Beano</em>'s choice
to lock itself in time means it appeals to a child audience exclusively,
which makes it effective as nostalgia but not as adult
entertainment.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[As I anxiously await
the birth of my first son (due in five days from the time of this writing), I
can’t help but be immersed in a sense of nostalgia on a number of different
levels – nostalgia for the bachelor life, for the freedom of mobility that
comes with being unattached, for knowing that there is no one dependent on my
actions or inactions save myself. This nostalgia, like all nostalgias, is
infectious, and has also gotten me reflecting on my personal habits when it
comes to comic collecting. My current collection stands at more than 20,000
issues, each of them bagged and boarded and housed in a monstrous
custom-built library. In thinking about the collection as a whole, I find
that I’m nostalgic not for the experience of reading them over the course of
the years or for any particular storyline, but for what the collection
represents in terms of the moments of acquisition that surround each
particu<a

img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1693"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/comics-300x225
.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>lar issue. Flipping through long
box after long box, as impossible as it seems I can remember the date of
purchase of nearly every comic that I own. In each box is housed the memories
of who I was at the moment I acquired these comics, and I carry the
collection with me both cognitively and physically as I move through my life.

	Here at Graphixia we infrequently acknowledge the materiality of comics
as objects, items that are often collected for the sake of being collected,
and that are just as often purchased not to be read but to fill in a gap in a
run of issues. Many of my own comics were acquired for this reason, both
online and at conventions. Though I ostensibly buy my comics for the stories
they contain and do value them for this reason, the larger collection is more
important to me for the very different rationale of the order that it
represents. Walter Benjamin is well aware of this aspect of collecting, and
I’m often drawn to his “Unpacking my Library” when thinking of my own
collecting habits. He writes:

	There is in the life of the collector a dialectical tension between the
poles or order and disorder. Naturally, his existence is tied to… a
relationship with objects which does not emphasize their functional,
utilitarian value – that is their usefulness – but studies and loves them as
the scene, the stage, of their fate … Everything remembered and thought,
everything conscious, becomes the pedestal, the frame, the base, the lock of
his property (60).

	Though Benjamin is writing about his books, the application is the same
for the comic collector – these often simple superhero stories, diverse and
unrealistic as they are, are intertwined with my own. One could argue that
the same could hold true for all literature, that comics don’t hold a special
place for the collector, but this isn’t exactly true – comics lend themselves
to memory and nostalgia because they are visual, allowing for a more
immersive experience in the fictional moment. These images, grafted in
juxtaposition with those of daily life, allow me to be nostalgic for the
story in the comic, the physical properties of it, as equally as I am for the
moment in time during which I experienced them. For me, owning these comics
is, in a way, taking ownership of these moments as well.

	As I reflect on my childhood (and, to be fair, my adulthood as well), I
am immediately filled with all of the images of the comics I read as I am the
places in which I grew up and the people who I met. Standing in front of my
library, I’m standing in front of myself – in my mind’s eye I see the stark
lines of Frank Miller’s Dark Knight Returns as I, at eight years old in 1988,
read the comic for the first time while waiting in the Surrey Public Library
for my younger brother to finish his art class. Equally, I’m drawn back to
the Time and Time Again Superman crossover arc, reading each weekly issue
with a friend who, in junior high, skipped class every Wednesday to pick up
the next installment. Even a few years ago, I’m sitting in my Aunt’s
apartment, reading the final issue of Cerebus maxi-series, a comic I’d been
waiting for for over a decade at that point. These and endless other
characters, storylines, even particular panels surface in my memory, always
juxtaposed with the moment during which I consumed them. The interplay of
these forces and the synaesthetic quality of the experience makes comic
collecting an important aspect of why I choose to hoard, alphabetize and
maintain them and why I will continue to read and collect likely for the rest
of my life – I feel a sense of pity that the next generation could be unaware
of this facet of comics, as trades, digitals and webcomics replace the
ephemera that are permanently bound to my most formative experiences.

	This post has been, perhaps, more nostalgic than it has been about
nostalgia, but this kind of self involvement is what reading and collecting
fiction of any kind – and particularly tales of the fantastic – is ultimately
founded on. I know that when I pass the vast number of comics in my
collection on to my son, years from now, I’ll be quietly giving him all of
the moments that make up who I am, stamped on these lifeless things, captured
unassumingly (and unknowably) in the stories that he will one day hopefully
read.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The Third
International Conference on Comics Conference: Comics Rock!</em> took place
over Thursday, June 28 and Friday, June 29, 2012 at Bournemouth University in
England. Previous versions were held at Manchester Metropolitan University.
Julia Round of Bournemouth University was the main organizer. Each day of the
conference covered a different theme: <em>Comics and Education</em> for June
28 and <em>Comics and Multimodal Adaptation</em> for June 29. I will deal
with each day in a separate post. What follows is a synopsis of the panels
and events that I attended plus some added material from Damon Herd of the
University of Dundee, who kindly offered notes on panels that he attended but
I didn't. My intent is to present content rather than critique to give people
who were unable to attend a sense of what the papers were about. If you
attended the conference and/or presented one of the papers I discuss but have
a different view than I present here, feel free to add a comment and we'll
update the post.

	Julia set up a drinks and dinner meet-up on the Wednesday evening before
the conference began. This event created a strong camaraderie among the
participants. We ended up drinking ales and talking comics late into the
night, which was a bit worrisome for me because I had to present in one of
the first sessions the next morning. By the end of the evening everyone knew
what everyone else was doing anyway, so it wasn't so bad. <h2>Comics in
College</h2> [caption id="attachment_1781" align="aligncenter" width="189"]<a

Paul Williams (left) chats with Paul Davies[/caption] <p style="text-align:
left;">This was my session. I presented alongside Paul Davies of the
University of Sussex and Charles Stephens from Texas A&amp;M University. In
“Comics Creation as Enrichment in an FE/Sixth Form College,” Paul talked
about the usefulness of having students produce comics as part of their
activity days, days for pursuing activities that are not conventionally
academic. Paul used Scott McCloud's 24 Hour Comics Challenge to engage the
students. While some students had trouble getting started and getting
finished, the project was highly successful and produced several anthologies.
Alas the project has finished.</p>

height="300" /></a> Charles Stephens and Christina Meyer[/caption] <p
style="text-align: left;">In “Social (and Metaphysical) Justice:
<em>Hellblazer</em> in the College Composition Classroom” Charles talked
about the efficacy of using comics to allow students to talk about social
justice issues as concrete representations and not just ideological
positions. Furthermore, <em>Hellblazer</em> provided a useful bridge for
ideological positions between Charles and some of his "conservative"
students. In addition to reading and discussing <em>Hellblazer</em>, students
had to produce a script for a six-panel comic that presented their position
on a social justice issue. The constraint of the comic format produced more
interesting work than conventional essays because it engaged the students as
creative, reflective producers, quite the contrast to the uninvested work of
the typical first-year composition class. Charles did a great job,
considering his own constraint: he had lost his flash drive during a bag
inspection at the Dallas airport.</p> I won't say much about my own paper, as
I will discuss that elsewhere, but the topic was the relationship between
comics and document use literacy: how we might use comics to teach people to
negotiate the complex network of signs, tables, charts, and instructions that
define our perceptual world. To put it briefly, such teaching would involve
resisting discussing comics as if they were prose and engaging with their
visual array instead. <h2><strong>Comics as Inspirational Teaching Tools
(Notes from Damon Herd)</strong></h2> <strong></strong> Nicola Streeten &amp;
Lisa El Refaie began their presentation, “Comics as a Tool for Transformative
Meaning Making,” with a mime performance, each wearing a mask. The point was
to show how the audience projected their own meaning onto the performance and
create their own story. They quoted Micheal White and David Epston's
<em>Narrative Means to Therapeutic Ends</em> (WW Norton, 1990) “All stories
have the potential to be transformative because they are full of gaps” and
claimed that comics make the gaps more explicit and concrete. They compared
Streeten’s Billy, Me &amp; You with Willy Linthout’s Years of the Elephant to
discuss dealing with bereavement without god or religion. Traumatic events,
they asserted, invoke a search for a meta-narrative.

	In “The Iconography of Illness: Comics and Medical Education,” Ian
Williams discussed visualizing disease as the 'other' and how medical
practitioners have been using comics to present and discuss illness with
patients. [I was disappointed that my session conflicted with Ian Williams'
talk. I've read quite a bit about his project and was keen to hear him in
person.--PW]

	Kym Tabulo, in “Developing Aesthetic Skills and Self-esteem: Using
Conventional and Abstract Comics in Art,” discussed the use of abstract
comics in classroom and the difference between them and abstract polyptychs
in fine art. She talked about how her students created their own abstract
comics, influenced by Andrei Molotiu’s <em>Abstract Comics: The
Anthology</em>.  Damon continued the discussion with Kym over lunch as she
presented a quiz she does with students in which they have to guess which
slides are comics and which are fine art.  Interestingly she said there was a
right answer. <h2><strong>Comics as Resources for Research and
Life</strong></h2> [caption id="attachment_1783" align="alignleft"
width="227"]<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Ian-Hague-and
-Simon-Grennan-small.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1783"

Simon-Grennan-small-227x300.jpg" alt="" width="227" height="300" /></a> Ian
Hague (left) talks with Simon Grennan[/caption]

	<strong></strong>Ian Hague of the University of Chichester detailed his
ambitious plans for expanding <em>The Comics Forum</em>, his organization
that runs an academic conference alongside Thought Bubble, an annual comics
convention in Leeds.  Ian outlined the resources that the<em> Forum</em>
already had, such as the website, the scholar's directory, and the blog, and
plans for future, the most exciting of which was perhaps the creation of a
professional scholarly body for comics scholars.

	Heather Wilson of Glyndwr University presented a conference highlight in
"Why Girls Need Comics and Comics Need Girls." Heather was not used to
speaking before a large audience and had to pause at moments, but her
material made everyone sit up and take notice. She demonstrated the typical
array of magazines available for girls in the UK and the banality of the
narratives they provide as models. Heather and her colleagues have been able
to produce a tonic to such magazines with <em>Clockwork Express</em>, which
presents more intellectual stories that don't conform to the gender-code
straight jacket. She also talked about "She Inspired" a project that involved
classroom visits to schools in which both girls and boys created comics about
notable women in history. The boys were just as into the project as girls and
showed no hesitation at getting involved with the subject matter. At the
conclusion of her talk, there was a rush to purchase copies of <em>Clockwork
Express</em>. I was in that rush because I have a 9 year old daughter  who
fits into the category Heather described as "the middle-aged kid": girls
between 8 and 13. <h2>Roundtable: The Place of Comics on English Degrees</h2>
Paul Williams (Exeter University), Chris Murray (University of Dundee), Matt
Green (University of Nottingham), and Dean Chan (University of Wollongong)
talked generally about what comics were being taught in degree programs and
how they related to other literature. For example, in one introduction to the
novel course at Exeter, Alison Bechdel's Fun Home is taught as "the future of
the novel." This struck me as odd because Fun Home is a memoir rather than a
novel but still.... Chris Murray talked about setting up his degree program
at Dundee as well as an available module in the undergraduate English program
on "Contemporary British Writers of Comics and Graphic Novels." The most
striking thing for me about this panel was that Dean Chan referred to the
popularity of teaching Ann Marie Fleming's <em>The Magical Life of Long Tack
Sam</em> in Asian-American literature courses in Australia. Ann Marie and I
were in the English program at the University of British Columbia together,
and it was uncanny to have travelled to Bournemouth from Canada to hear
someone from Australia talk about the work of someone I used to know!
<h2><strong>Teaching Literature</strong></h2> <strong></strong> Di Laycock's
(University of Sydney) paper, “Teacher Tales from the Graphic Novel
Classroom” stood out the most for me among this group because her
phenomenological case study of how Australian teachers were using and
responding to graphic novels struck me as timely. We usually rely on
anecdotal evidence for what works in the classroom without ever putting the
information together in a comprehensive fashion. So, when Laycock reported
that teachers had a highly positive experience with graphic novels in terms
of their own pedagogy and student outcomes, it meant something because it was
based on a wide-ranging study. Shari Sabeti (University of Stirling) and Mel
Gibson's (Northumbria University) papers (“Comic Book Adaptations of
<em>Hamlet</em> for the Education Environment” and “<em>Macbeth</em>:
Adaptation, Teaching, and Fidelity” respectively) on adapting Shakespeare
bridged the two themes of this year's conference, and could easily have fit
into the next day's "Multimodal Adaptation" sessions, particularly Sabeti's,
as she talked about how a contemporary student's relationship to Shakespeare
was transmedial and multimodal: students read the play, watch the film
adaptations, and look at images of the Globe Theatre. Sabeti had some
interesting things to say about how comics artists used visual means to
represent Hamlet's "To be or not to be" speech. Gibson's talk focused on
adaptations of <em>Macbeth</em> and how they tended to replicate a
"historical" image of the play and did not attempt science fiction versions
and the like. She argued that the banal imagery of comic book adaptations
tended to counter the horrors of the play. These discussions of the
adaptations of Shakespeare led me to think that such adaptations tend to be a
millstone for the serious consideration of comics because they promote the
idea that the comics are subordinate to "literature" in terms of content and
complexity. As Gibson noted, reading the adaptation is often equated with
"cheating." More mashups and remixes are required I think. <h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Teaching Socialization and Values (Notes from Damon
Herd)</strong></h2> <strong></strong> Kenan Kocak (Glasgow University) in
“Comics in Education: <em>Cin Ali</em> from Turkey” discussed this series of
10 picture books, whose reading level increases with each book, used to teach
reading to children in Turkey. Cin Ali translates as cunning Ali, although he
appears to be well-behaved with no real evidence of cunning. Kocak noted
there was nostalgic affection for these books although on close examination
they could be seen as tools of the conservative State to encourage children
to conform.  Interestingly, the drawings are all stickmen/women--even the
animals have stick bodies and limbs-- but the heads, feet and hands are all
quite detailed. This odd combination makes one re-consider McCloud’s idea of
how icons function to produce identification in comics.

	Michael Freund (Webster University, Vienna) was unique in presenting on a
newspaper strip in “Deconstructing Berzerkistan and Other War Zones: Satire
in Doonesbury as an Educational Tool.” Freund discussed the press reception
of the BD character’s experiences in the war zones of Vietnam, Afganistan,
Kuwait, and Iraq. <h2><strong>Plenary Session</strong></h2> [caption

Hannah Means-Shannon talks with David Lloyd[/caption]

	<strong></strong> The plenary session was David Lloyd (<em>V for
Vendetta</em>, <em>Kickback</em>), and Steve Marchant (<em>The Cartoonist’s
Workshop</em>) of Cartoon Classroom talking about their work. Lloyd offered a
polemic on the necessity of separating "sequential art" from "comics" because
there are too many preconceptions and too much media baggage surrounding the
term "comics," preventing practitioners such as himself from attaining
"artist" status. Lloyd's talk and the responses to it suggested that comics'
place in the world of art and literature is still vexed even among those who
study and produce them. Marchant talked about his work with troubled youth
and kids with special needs, showing how making comics helped them with their
problems. Marchant's talk captured perhaps the prominent theme of the day:
making comics can be an empowering experience for school kids, college and
university students, and people on the margins of society, making them
invested creators whose artistic production gives them self-esteem and a
sense of place in the world. My favourite example from Marchant's talk was
some of his work with senior citizens who turned their memories into comics.
I don't believe that the results were anthologized and published, but if they
were to be, they would make a fabulous work of comic book history.

	A review of the second day of the conference, whose theme was "Comics and
Multimodal Adaptation" will follow in the next day or so.<strong

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[That’s why Abstract Comics is important. Like
any comics anthology, it has some pieces I like a lot more than others, but
the sheer existence of the book itself establishes a precedent and a meeting
place for the small community of readers who do, in fact, give a shit (or who
might give a shit after looking through the book’s pages). Equally
encouraging to me are the casual asides in your responses, Derik, about
hearing Sokolin speak at MoCCA and attending the “Silent Pictures” exhibit:
there’s clearly an art world coalescing around the idea of abstract comics, a
community of artists provoking each other to create better work. Blaise
Larmee won an Xeric grant (hollah!), Abstract Comics is in my university’s
library, and I can’t wait to see the comics that you, Andrei and your fellow
experimenters make next, Derik. Apathy be damned!]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[When I first came across images from "Abstract
Comics: The Anthology" online, I was worried that a lot of it would be
non-objective paintings cut out and put next to each other as more of a
series. When I received my order and flipped through the book, I was happy to
see that I was mostly wrong. Some of the images do seem a bit
uncharacteristic of comics, but most of them still conform largely to comic
style, just with abstracted story telling. Upon first glance all the images
might seem random, but taking the time to "read" the comic, they still are
able to read as having a narrative of some sort.I really liked the brief
introduction including in the beginning of this book, it helped give a
history of the idea of abstract comics and where it came from. It's hard to
say how accurate it is, since there aren't any other references to compare it
to. There was also a description explaining that since all comics are in one
way or another abstract that "abstract" in this sense does not refer to the
painting style, but to the form of story telling where characters and
settings are simplified down to their basic principles.If you're looking for
more concrete narrative, you might be disappointed in this book. However if
you're interested in comics or abstract artwork, I'd still recommend giving
this book a chance.]]></wp:comment_content>

<title>#76 The Bayeux Tapestry: The World&#039;s First Graphic Novel?</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hiya, Graphixians.
 I've been away for a while and wrote this post "on location" in France where
I had the chance to view the Bayeux Tapestry up close and personal.* It was a
marvellous experience, even with the crowds and the constructed setting, but
as I looked at it I was mostly finding myself thinking of how this historical
artifact fits the parameters for a graphic novel.

	I'm not the first person to have this thought.  Lots of us who want to
see comics taken seriously in an academic context have looked to historical
examples of graphic communication as a way to validate or historicize this
field of study.  What makes the Bayeux Tapestry different than examples of,
for example, cave paintings, is that the tapestry combines images and text as
we've come to expect graphic narratives to do.

	The tapestry is also interesting because its narrative follows a long
period of time and includes historical backstory.  It tells, as I'm sure you
know, the history of the Norman Conquest of England in 1066.  It's a
fantastically detailed text; we come to understand motivation, the passage of
time, intrigue, deceit, and the complexity of victory.  It's a testament to
the depth and complexity of the text that people make arguments for it both
as a work of victor's history and a challenge to the dominant narrative about
Norman Conquest.  In and of itself that's kind of cool.

	I want to focus on the interplay of time in the Bayeux Tapestry, because
I think it's the element that makes this storytelling most sophisticated,
thereby speaking to the way we read graphic narratives now.

	<img class="alignleft"
src="http://www.bayeuxtapestry.org.uk/Images/Bayeux/Bayeux13.jpg" alt=""
width="650" height="180" />

	Notice here the order of events.  King Edward's funeral is occurring in
the central panel of the portion shown here.  This is the main event in this
part of the tapestry because it moves the narrative along.  Without Edward's
death, we don't have Harald's betrayal and the story doesn't roll forward.
 So that's the present moment.  But look to the right -- the tapestry does
not always move chronologically.  In this panel, we see the king very ill in
the top portion (Harald at his side), and dead in the bottom portion.  All of
this comes <em>after</em> the funeral scene.  The tapestry weavers seem
intent on us knowing that the funeral is the central focus, with the next
panel serving to explain and illustrate rather than moving the action along
chronologically.

	Isn't that <em>cool</em>?

	If you're wondering why all this matters, that's totally ok.  I'm not
sure where I'm headed with these** observations.  But I think it's
interesting to see the depth and complexity in early graphic texts and to
recognize the history of interpretation that we draw upon when we approach
graphic narratives.

	Also, man, I saw the Bayeux Tapestry!  And it was really cool!  So this
is also a post about that.

	--

	* This should be read to mean "through a glass cabinet, mediated by
careful lighting and an audio guide, and in a throng of German tourists."

	** Or any.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[As with my report on
Day 1 of <em><a title="http://comics.bujournalism.info/"
href="http://comics.bujournalism.info/" target="_blank">The Third
International Conference on Comics: Comics Rock!</a></em>, what follows is a
discussion of the panels that I saw on Day 2 when the theme was Comics and
Multimodal Adaptation. I have presented ideas as I remember them with some
help from my Twitter feed. I have also once again used Damon Herd's notes for
a couple of concurrent panels. If you attended the conference and remember
things differently, please leave a comment. If you went to different panels
than I did, and would like to contribute to the report, please let us know.
<strong></strong>

	<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Analytical Frames for
Adaptation</strong></span>

	Day 2 of the Comics Rock! conference began for me with the panel on
“Analytic Frames for Adaptation.” This panel was Canadian-heavy in a
Canadian-heavy conference, featuring <a
title="http://cinema.concordia.ca/current-students/student-work/graduate/phd-
in-film-and-moving-image-studies/jeffries-dru.php"
href="http://cinema.concordia.ca/current-students/student-work/graduate/phd-
in-film-and-moving-image-studies/jeffries-dru.php" target="_blank">Dru
Jeffries</a> from Concordia University and <a
title="http://english.ucalgary.ca/profiles/bart-beaty"
href="http://english.ucalgary.ca/profiles/bart-beaty" target="_blank">Bart
Beaty</a> of the University of Calgary alongside <a
title="http://www.kartoonkings.com/" href="http://www.kartoonkings.com/"
target="_blank">Simon Grennan</a> of Kartoon Kings as the lone UK
representative. This panel was also, for me, the most intellectually exciting
of the conference, a real treat.

	In "The Comic Book Film as Palimpsest" Jeffries discussed how film
adaptations “remediate” comics, that is how they not only recast story and
character as cinema but attempt to capture and reframe the medium of comics
itself. He outlined different kinds of textuality and showed examples of
films such as <em><a title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416449/"
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416449/" target="_self">300</a></em>
creating “panel effects” using slow motion and freezing. One of Jeffries’
points that struck me was how film operates in “landscape” mode and has
difficulties remediating vertically oriented “portrait” panels. Jeffries’
presentation also made me re-consider the argument that Hollywood is
destroying comics by co-opting them. The examples of intertextuality showed
efforts to satisfy and an allegiance towards the comics aficionado, the
person who will be comparing the film adaptation to the original. The film
directors appear to be saying, “Don’t hate me; I like the comic too.”

	Simon Grennan came between the two Canadians. I have seen Simon present
before and admire his ability to present theoretical concepts succinctly and
precisely. His talk, "Register in the Guise of Genre: Instrumental Adaptation
in the Early Comics of Grennan and Sperandio" was about how he and
Christopher Sperandio, his partner in Kartoon Kings, have adapted comics to
new sociological situations, playing with generic expectations of comics, to
produce a kind of discord, a mismatch between generic expectation and social
function or context. Grennan and Sperandio adapted covers from 1950s EC
comics and used them as covers for museum programs, oral histories, and other
public, social forms of art that Grennan and Sperandio perform. I would call
the effect of this “misapprehension” a version of the uncanny, a term that
Grennan did not use, but that captures the generic familiarity and the
alienation of the new context.

	Beaty’s talk, "Toward a Theory of the Site-Specific Comic: Dave McKean's
<em><a
title="http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DEOJDMpieAZM%
26feature%3Dyoutube_gdata_player&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player&amp;v=

26feature%3Dyoutube_gdata_player&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player&amp;v=
EOJDMpieAZM&amp;gl=US" target="_blank">The Rut</a></em>," linked
interestingly with Grennan’s because he too was discussing comics and context
in the case of Dave McKean’s <em>The Rut</em>. <em>The Rut</em> is a
site-specific comic, adapted to the gallery space; Beaty saw it at the
Pumphouse in Battersea Park in 2010. While comics of late have made their
entry into the gallery, Beaty argued, that space is not particularly suited
to them; there is a mismatch between the medium and the context, as curators
try to figure out how to place comics pages on the gallery wall. But <em>The
Rut</em> is a comic taken apart and reconfigured for the gallery space.
Pieces of it are on the floor; pieces hang on the wall, and pieces are
sculptural. While such an exhibit challenges the notion of the comic as book,
it remains comics, said Beaty. In the discussion afterwards, Grennan argued
that <em>The Rut</em> worked because of the sociological context of the
piece. As “art,” he said, it is awful, but as comic it is something else.

	The second sets of panels for the day were <a
title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha"
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha" target="_blank">Pecha
Kucha</a> sessions. Pecha Kucha requires 20 slides with the presenter
spending 20 seconds on each slide. An interesting way of stressing the visual
dimension of presentations, the Pecha Kucha put a constraint on the speaker
analogous to constraints that comics artists place upon themselves.

	<a

Contact-Page,id=27740/"
href="http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-Contributor,a=M/view-
Contact-Page,id=27740/" target="_blank">Hannah Means-Shannon</a> of Georgian
Court University at first thought that format did not allow the presenter to
speak, and that the audience would examine each slide in silence for 20
seconds. Fortunately, she was put right before her presentation, “Towards an
Auteur Theory of Comics.” Means-Shannon examined the validity and
desirability of adapting auteur theory from film, particularly the French New
Wave, to comic book production. Auteur theory essentially gives all creative
vision and power to the director, and one way of looking at auteur theory is
as a means of diminishing the notion of film as a collaborative work. In the
case of the comics that Means-Shannon was discussing, the penciller was the
auteur, and for comics that adapt works from other media, the auteur theory
is a way of exploring how visual artists can assert authority over the work.
Means-Shannon focused on <a
title="http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-Contributor,a=M/view-
Contact-Page,id=27740/" href="http://www.artofpcraigrussell.com/"
target="_blank">P. Craig Russell</a>’s adaptation of the <em><a
title="http://www.darkhorse.com/Books/Previews/11-532"
href="http://www.darkhorse.com/Books/Previews/11-532" target="_self">Ring of
the Nibelung</a></em> and <a title="http://www.garethhinds.com/"
href="http://www.garethhinds.com/" target="_blank">Gareth Hinds</a>'
adaptation of <em><a title="http://www.garethhinds.com/beowulf.php"
href="http://www.garethhinds.com/beowulf.php"
target="_blank">Beowulf</a></em>. The fact that the artists are working with
classics whose authors are long-dead gives them an authority and autonomy
that is frequently lacking when artists have to work with living writers. In
the comic book world, the writer is still king. Consider the position of Alan
Moore relative to the artists who have rendered his ideas. Means-Shannon used
three criteria from Andrew Sarris to assess auteur theory as it applies to
comics: technical competence, personal style, and interior meaning. The two
artists in question fulfilled these criteria, but not in a way that totally
validated auteur theory. Indeed, Means-Shannon expressed concerns about the
applicability of this theory to comics, quoting....who said that auteurism
led to a cult of personality. I found this presentation interesting in
relation to the vexed issue of authorship in comics, both in terms of
collaboration between writers and artists and in the notion of the comic as
property owned by a large media corporation.

	<a title="http://www.damonherd.com/" href="http://www.damonherd.com/"
target="_blank">Damon Herd</a> of Dundee University and Duncan of Jordanstone
College of Art and Design presented on <em><a
title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four:_Unstable_Molecules"
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four:_Unstable_Molecules"
target="_blank">Unstable Molecules: The True Story of Comics’ Greatest
Foursome</a></em> by James Sturm as the adaptation of superhero comics to
biography. As with several of the other presentations on this day, the
boundary between “story world” and reality was contested or at least made
permeable in Herd’s discussion of the two texts and their relationship to
each other. The most interesting aspect to me of this presentation was the
way in which Sturm’s indie comic project co-opts the superhero comic. The two
genres are usually viewed as polar, competing opposites in the comics world,
that have nothing to do with each other except for medium, but, as Herd
showed, they are in fact wound around each other, each unable to exist except
in relation to the other.

target="_blank">Ian Culbard</a> talked about their process for adapting
well-known works of literature into comics. They began by discussing their
adaptation of <em><a
title="http://www.selfmadehero.com/title.php?isbn=9780955816932"
href="http://www.selfmadehero.com/title.php?isbn=9780955816932"
target="_blank">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a></em>, particularly Culbard’s
issues with drawing Dorian's beauty, which is one thing to describe in prose
and another to present in cartoon form. One of Culbard’s friends suggested
that he use a stick figure as a kind of inversion of that beauty and a
testament to the impossibility of drawing it. I thought this suggestion a
brilliant one, but Edginton and Culbard did not choose that route.

	From Edginton’s writer's perspective, the issue for adapting well-known
literary works is always what language to include and what to cut out. He
knows that whatever choice he makes, readers who love the original text will
criticize. Never underestimate the power of a contraction when adapting a
literary work to comics, he said.

	With their <a title="http://www.selfmadehero.com/sherlockholmes/"
href="http://www.selfmadehero.com/sherlockholmes/" target="_blank">Sherlock
Holmes</a> adaptations, of which there have been four, the pair wanted to
strip away elements of Holmes' dress and persona that movies and television
have created to get at Conan Doyle’s vision in the texts themselves. This
desire for fidelity struck me as at odds with other presentations at the
conference that argued fidelity wasn’t necessarily the key term in
considering a successful adaptation.

	Culbard spoke of the time and effort they put into rendering roomscapes,
which made me think about how mapping space was so important in comics.
Culbard also made an interesting comment about an artist finding his or her
style by failing to copy successfully the work of an artist he or she
admired.

	All the plenary speakers for the conference were creators rather than
critics, so the emphasis was on giving an insight into the creative process,
on showing rather than arguing or uncovering some new way of reading comics.

	<span style="text-decoration:
underline;"><strong>Authorship</strong></span>

	In "Moral Rights of Authors and <em><a
title="http://www.dccomics.com/batman" href="http://www.dccomics.com/batman"
target="_blank">Batman</a></em>," <a
title="http://courses.nus.edu.sg/course/hisilg/gordon.html"
href="http://courses.nus.edu.sg/course/hisilg/gordon.html"
target="_blank">Ian Gordon</a> of the University of Singapore discussed the
issue of who counts as the author of <em>Batman</em> in the light of the
<em><a title="http://www.dccomics.com/superman"
href="http://www.dccomics.com/superman" target="_blank">Superman</a></em>
court cases surrounding <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Shuster"
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Shuster" target="_blank">Joe
Shuster</a> and <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Siegel"
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Siegel" target="_blank">Jerry
Siegel</a>. Gordon pointed out that while <em>Batman</em>’s authorship has
never been legally contested--<a
title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kane"
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kane" target="_blank">Bob Kane</a> has
been credited with inventing the superhero, and his name appears on
<em>Batman</em> comics to this day--questions of who has the moral right over
the work persist, as they do in many comics that have multiple writers and
artists. For example, Kane ultimately did have to acknowledge <a
title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Finger"
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Finger" target="_blank">Bill
Finger</a> for his role in <em>Batman</em>’s creation. Gordon also discussed
the plight of other contributors to the comic such as <a
title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Robinson"
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Robinson" target="_blank">Jerry
Robinson</a> whom many credit with the invention of the Joker. Gordon
recounted how <a
title="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/The_Joker_(Jack_Nicholson)"
href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/The_Joker_(Jack_Nicholson)"
target="_blank">Jack Nicholson</a> received 17% of product royalties from the
<em>Batman</em> film in which he played the Joker, but that Robinson, who
consulted on the film, got nothing of those royalties. The question
authorship and the moral rights that go with it is a troubling one for
comics, whose titles tend to be corporate properties. Gordon’s talk thus
intersected with Means-Shannons’ discussion of auteur theory.

	In "Constructing The Pier: Writing for Comics within Transmedia
Narratives," <a title="http://staff.glam.ac.uk/users/1705-bfagence"
href="http://staff.glam.ac.uk/users/1705-bfagence" target="_blank">Brian
Fagence</a> of The University of Glamorgan talked about the role of comics in
the transmedia project of <em>The Fallows Narratives</em>, in the segment
called <em>The Pier</em>. Fagence went through some examples of transmedial
storytelling: films and television shows that have video games and music
associated with them, for instance. While in those cases, the transmedia
elements tend to be superficial product add-ons, <em>The Fallows
Narratives</em> ambitiously has a story world that jumps across media
platforms, with no particular one dominating, in order to see how the media
transform the message. Fagence showed how Punch and Judy were originary
figures for <em>The Fallows Narratives</em> and were transmedial figures in
their own right. Because <em>The Fallows Narratives</em> is also a
multi-author project, I asked Brian how he was going to avoid the kinds of
authorship problems that Ian Gordon was talking about. He said he had no idea
but that he would have to start thinking about it. It is worth noting that
many of the people working on the project are Fagence’s students, so this
project is another of the many mentioned at the conference that bridges
creative and critical thinking.

href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305206/" target="_blank">American
Splendor</a></em> to challenge the notion of identity in the autobiographical
work. In Gianni De Luca's Shakespeare adaptations we see pages that are not
broken down into panels but several images of the same characters moving
across the ‘set’ of the page. This effect made Damon think of <a

<em><a title="http://www.richard-mcguire.com/"

	In “The Universal Grotesque: Multimodal Film Adaptations and Harvey
Pekar, <a title="http://selkirk.ca/discover/staff/detail/?staff=10845"
href="http://selkirk.ca/discover/staff/detail/?staff=10845"
target="_blank">Ian Dawe</a>--yet another Canadian from Selkirk College, used
Bakhtin’s theory of carnival and grotesque realism to claim that comics are
inherently grotesque and carnivalesque, reflecting our own anxiety about our
animal form, so there was a nice link here to Shail’s presentation.

	Dawe discussed the <em>American Splendor</em> film adaptation and the
difference between movement image and time image from Gilles Deleuze's theory
of film. "<em>American Splendor</em> the film is like a Russian doll," said
Dawe, with layers hidden beneath layers, and characters and actors being
different versions of themselves. In one scene the characters are watching
themselves portrayed by other actors in a play about their life; the scene in
the play has already been depicted in the movie.

	At this point in the day I was losing my sharpness, which was not a fault
of the presentations, just too much information to take in in one day!

	<a title="http://e-merl.com/" href="http://e-merl.com/"
target="_blank">Daniel Merlin</a> Goodbrey of The University of Hertfordshire
is an artist who creates web comics. His “Digital Comics--New Tools and
Tropes” showed how digitalization was both transforming the possibilities for
creating comics and the definition of comics itself. One of the main
challenges to this definition is the use of animation in web comics. Usually,
animation and comics are considered separate media, but computer technology
allows us to embed animations in comics. Goodbrey said that when people ask
him if what he’s doing is still comics, his response is that if the viewer
controls the reading experience, then whatever he or she is looking at is
comics. I was unsure of this point because it made me think of how a remote
control on a television, particularly with a digital video recorder, gives
the viewer control over the material. At the end of the day, though, these
ontological questions don't matter as much as the degree of invention and
artistry in play. For example, Goodbrey also showed how scrolling on the
computer allows for longer frames than the printed page would allow, such as
in <a title="http://scottmccloud.com/" href="http://scottmccloud.com/"
target="_blank">Scott McCloud</a>'s <em><a
title="http://scottmccloud.com/1-webcomics/zot/index.html"
href="http://scottmccloud.com/1-webcomics/zot/index.html"
target="_blank">Zot</a></em>, refigure the the possiblitities for artistic
expression.

	<a title="http://www.shakescene.tw/member/chaotiang.html"
href="http://www.shakescene.tw/member/chaotiang.html" target="_blank">Tien-yi
Chao</a>, of National Taiwan University gave the only presentation on
Japanese manga and anime that I saw in “Transmutation of Worlds:
Intertextuality between <em><a
title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist"
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist" target="_blank">Full
Metal Alchemist</a></em> and <em><a
title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist_the_Movie:
_Conqueror_of_Shamballa"
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist_the_Movie:
_Conqueror_of_Shamballa" target="_blank">Conqueror of Shamballa</a></em>.
Chao talked about the different versions of the manga as it has been adapted
for TV and film and how they revised the original, in some case presenting
the opposite of the original. As with many adaptations under discussion on
the day, adaptation was more about taking liberties and presenting different
versions than fidelity to the "original." Creators and audiences want new
spins on the material, not the same again.

	Besides the theme of liberation from the concept of fidelity, the
dominant idea of the day was that of the mise en abyme of the storyworld, or
infinite diegesis. By jumping from one medium or mode to another, a narrative
can create the effect of abandonning any relationship to reality or realism
and becoming suspended in a multimodal mirror space. <a
title="http://www.artdes.mmu.ac.uk/profile/jormrod"
href="http://www.artdes.mmu.ac.uk/profile/jormrod" target="_blank">Joan
Ormrod</a>, of Manchester Metropolitan University, addressed this issue in
“Adapting the <a title="http://www.fvza.org/" href="http://www.fvza.org/"
target="_blank">Federal Vampire and Zombie Agency</a> from Website to <a
title="http://radicalpublishing.com/shop/comics/series_all/federal%20vampire%
20and%20zombie%20agency"
href="http://radicalpublishing.com/shop/comics/series_all/federal%20vampire%
20and%20zombie%20agency" target="_blank">Comic</a>: History, Realism,
Narrative." Ormrod discussed the cult status of the website and the way it
created an alternative reality in itself with lots of true believers in the
vampire and zombie world. In this instance, the line between fiction and
reality becomes somewhat porous, as fiction invades or infects reality.
Ormrod discussed how this porousness affected the adaptation of the website
into the comic, particularly in the creation of characters, as the only
character on the website is the mysterious Hugo Pecos.

	To sum up, the theme of adaptation turned out to be intellectually
provocative, inviting more theoretical and technical presentations, perhaps,
than the previous day's topic of comics and education. The discussion of
education tended to be pragmatic and demonstrative: "here's what I did in the
classroom and how successful it was." Adaptation lent itself to more "here's
how it works" arguments. The multimodal quality of comic books in themselves,
makes the issue of adaptation to and from different media, different
contexts, and different worlds particularly complex and thought provoking.
The genius of the organizers, particularly <a
title="http://www.juliaround.com/" href="http://www.juliaround.com/"
target="_blank">Julia Round</a>, was to put a day of praxis next to a day of
theory in a way that created a distinct experience for each day.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Nicolas Mahler , recently distinguished with the
Max and Moritz Award three times in a row, is surely the internationally
best-known Austrian comic artist. His spare lines and figures without eyes,
ears or mouths, but with all the more striking hairstyles, are unique. Above
and beyond their idiosyncratic humour and wit, Mahler’s comics are always
subtle, sophisticated studies of human behaviour. The spectrum of his comics
ranges from autobiography (Kunsttheorie versus Frau Goldgruber / i.e. art
theory vs. Frau Goldgruber), humorous short strips and cartoons (Das
Unbehagen / i.e. discontent), genre parody (Engelmann: Der gefallene Engel /
i.e. Engelmann, the fallen angel), to comic adaptation (Thomas Bernhard’s
novel Old Masters / Alte Meister). His Flashko series has been adapted as an
animated fim, and his comic Kratochvil as a puppet
show.]]></wp:comment_content> <wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hannah Means-Shannon of Georgian Court
University at first thought that format did not allow the presenter to speak,
and that the audience would examine each slide in silence for 20 seconds.
Fortunately, she was put right before her presentation, “Towards an Auteur
Theory of Comics.” Means-Shannon examined the validity and desirability of
adapting auteur theory from film, particularly the French New Wave, to comic
book production. Auteur theory essentially gives all creative vision and
power to the director, and one way of looking at auteur theory is as a means
of diminishing the notion of film as a collaborative work. In the case of the
comics that Means-Shannon was discussing, the penciller was the auteur, and
for comics that adapt works from other media, the auteur theory is a way of
exploring how visual artists can assert authority over the work.
Means-Shannon focused on P. Craig Russell ’s adaptation of the Ring of the
Nibelung and Gareth Hinds ‘ adaptation of Beowulf . The fact that the artists
are working with classics whose authors are long-dead gives them an authority
and autonomy that is frequently lacking when artists have to work with living
writers. In the comic book world, the writer is still king. Consider the
position of Alan Moore relative to the artists who have rendered his ideas.
Means-Shannon used three criteria from Andrew Sarris to assess auteur theory
as it applies to comics: technical competence, personal style, and interior
meaning. The two artists in question fulfilled these criteria, but not in a
way that totally validated auteur theory. Indeed, Means-Shannon expressed
concerns about the applicability of this theory to comics, quoting….who said
that auteurism led to a cult of personality. I found this presentation
interesting in relation to the vexed issue of authorship in comics, both in
terms of collaboration between writers and artists and in the notion of the

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[However, after much research, I can finally
report that Frank’s comment about David Mazzucchelli’s theory of comics
simultaneity (“The page is taken in as a whole, the two page spread. It’s not
one image at a time. And it’s not necessarily linear in so much that it’s all
absorbed at once and then accepted as ‘ordered.’”) is absolutely spot on. At
least when you’re reading Mazzucchelli comics. It’s kind of amazing really.
It works with everything from Batman to Asterios Polyp . I don’t know how he
does it, but it’s true: entire spreads enter the reader’s brain
instantaneously.]]></wp:comment_content>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignleft"
src="http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article1144488.ece/ALTERNATES/s1227/The+
Dark+Knight+Rises+-+Rain+Poster" alt="" width="274" height="412" />...
prepare to have the fun sucked out of your favourite franchise.  Ok, maybe
not, but this is not a gushing, glowing review of <em>The Dark Knight
Rises</em>.  It is a deeply confused review of the film.  I will endeavour
not to include too much in the way of spoilers, but you might want to wait to
read this until you've seen the film, if only because I don't want to impose
my philosophical reading of the film on your experience of it.  So, it's a
movie about Occupy Wall Street, right?  More specifically, it's a movie about
rich white Hollywood's anxieties about Occupy Wall Street, right?  I'm not
the first person to make this observation, but even without having read the
reviews discussing the parallels I found myself so distracted by the
ham-fisted use of Occupy imagery that I couldn't fall into the story as I
expected to.  The film shows us just how misunderstood the rich are; they're
usurious, sure, and they oppress and suppress without really knowing that
they're doing it.  But what we find out once they're overthrown is that they
were really saving us from ourselves all along.  Because poor people go evil
*fast*.  Like you've got no idea how many people poor people would murder if
they got half a chance.  The villains of this picture have risen from poverty
specifically to kick ass, take names, and destroy World Order.  There is no
framework in this narrative where the world can be restructured from below
and have a positive outcome.  Also, visually, let's represent felons as
protestors -- let's conflate those two worlds.  Also, when we let wrongly
imprisoned people out of jail, they're still evil.  Just in case you were
wondering.  The writers say <a
href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1690715/dark-knight-rises-occupy-wall-
street.jhtml">the connections weren't intentional</a> -- of course they
weren't.  That's how cultural anxieties get worked out on the screen.  That's
why Godzilla is really about nuclear war and King Kong is about cultural
others and Twilight is about anxieties relating to the power of feminism.
 <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> demonstrates just how deeply anxiety about
class warfare has permeated popular consciousness.  Batman is about justice,
whether justice aligns with the rule of law or not.  Perhaps that's why I
found it so frustrating to watch a retelling of Batman's story that seems so
careful to infer that, once empowered to act for themselves, the collective
99% are a bunch of fucking morons.  And that only Gotham's wealthy patron and
caretaker -- even once brought low by the selfish, thoughtless poor people --
can rescue the city and save the people.  The benevolence of the elite.
 They're just better than us.  There are some beautiful performances in this
film; Joseph Gordon Leavitt and Anne Hathaway are tremendous additions to the
franchise, and the film ends on a letter-perfect note for fans of recent
developments in the comics.  The explosions are fantastic and the
cinematography is exquisite.  But the confused and problematic politics
undermine the positive aspects of the film to leave the end result muddled
and unsatisfying.]]></content:encoded>

Not in the slightest. The only thing I find disappointing in Cronenberg’s
professed absence of desire to ever direct a superhero movie is that his
sensibilities with regard to genre would go a long way toward toward
achieving the state he describes. Not to mention his skill as a director. But
it’s undeniably best for all concerned if directors continue to make the kind
of movies they want to make and not force themselves to work in forms that
don’t interest them. To Cronenberg his. To Christopher Nolan his. To each

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is why you can’t pay too much attention to
the buzz and get all wrapped up in Twitter noise that all of sudden made
everyone go, “Oscar frontrunner!” Early screenings of “Les Miserables” did
provoke audiences to burst into applause after certain song performances and
yes, many were in tears by the end of the film. And that’s because Tom
Hooper’s “Les Miserables” has two incredible sequences (both of which
audiences thundered over in our early screening), but the rest of the movie?
Well, maybe not so much. Though there’s actually lots of positive things to
say about the film. Its scope and ambition are to be admired, and Hooper’s
certainly stepped up his game from the rather pedestrian, but effective “The
King’s Speech.” It’s great to see the filmmaker challenging himself and “Les
Miserables,” at nearly two hours and forty minutes, is a huge, epic
undertaking. Anne Hathaway, as you’ve likely heard, is breathtakingly good in
her small, but unforgettable role as Fantine. She essentially brings the
house down with her stirring rendition of “I Dreamed A Dream.” Hugh Jackman
is also strong, and similarly emotionally committed to the role. And then
there’s that moving and spectacular finish, which will leave audiences
floored.]]></wp:comment_content> <wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved>

<title>#80 Of Pulp and Circumstance: The Forbidden Fruit of Y: The Last
Man</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[The cover art of <em>Y:
The Last Man</em> cultivates a paradox between the representation of
morality--the sexual status quo, the politics of gender--and the
representation of a world in which those morals have been subverted. <em>Y:
The Last Man</em> is about a subverted world, but it's not about an
enlightened world. In fact, the cover art suggests that the comic is
established in a long tradition of representing exploitation, perversion, and
immorality that is more juvenile fantasy than attempt to challenge the status
quo.

	On the surface, Brian K. Vaughn's <em>Y: The Last Man</em> holds infinite
promise. The premise, a world without men, is an old one (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Man" target="_blank">Mary
Shelley</a> had it first), but one that might allow space for alternate
representations of our social melieu, political methodologies, and cultural
tensions. Moreover, the subject of the comic's narrative seems oddly suited
to a medium that tends to target young boys and renders women into objects of
the reader's gaze, stripping them of agency in favour of the caped crusaders,
web-slingers and men-of-steel.

	With its allusions to Shakespeare (Yorick is the skull of self-reckoning
in Hamlet--a play in which the lead male character was once played by a Sarah
Bernhardt, even) and its consistent cleverness (Dr. Mann is a world full of
women), <em>Y: The Last Man</em> isn't shy on literary panache. However, it's
the visual allusions to pulp that seem to play against type most
significantly.

	<a

class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1890" title="issue8"

><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1895" title="killnowpaylater"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/killnowpaylater-
211x300.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="300" /></a>

	The covers above illustrate <em>Y: The Last Man</em>'s play on the
graphic tropes of pulp and romance. The covers both place emphasis on the
eroticized female, usually on the verge of some sexual triste and about to
become involved in something that will affect her moral purity in a negative
way--the act of taint usually visualized by some weapon or symbolic phallus.
It's all about potential, the potential of what fantasies are between the
pages (insert your vagina metaphor here). In <em>Y: The Last Man</em>,
potential answers to the source of the plague and the whereabouts of Yorick's
girlfriend are continually subverted by female "cat fights" and attempts to
corral the last remaining male on earth and his monkey (insert your <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0DXFQG5H2U&amp;feature=related"
target="_blank">Mike Myers Sprockets joke here</a>).

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/issue29.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1891" title="issue29"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/issue29-193x300.jpg"
alt="" width="193" height="300" /></a>

src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/murderontheside-
191x300.jpg" alt="" width="191" height="300" /></a>

	The above juxtaposition shows the emphasis the covers' art places on
draping fabric, light and shadow, postures of fear and submission,
accentuating the female body,  showing the reader a little of what's
underneath hiding just beneath the surface--an interpretive clue in visual
form. Those interpretative clues in visual form are what comics are all about
and <em>Y: The Last Man</em>, through both its cover art and the art in its
pages, to address the underlying queerness of the storyline.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/leathergirls.jpg"><
img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1896" title="leathergirls"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/leathergirls-187x300.
jpg" alt="" width="187" height="300" /></a>

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/issue33.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1893" title="issue33"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/issue33-193x300.jpg"
alt="" width="193" height="300" /></a>

	Here, the queerness is "fully realized,"  but in the story, itself based
on a man's epic quest to find his girlfriend, the emphasis is on traditional
causes, effects, relationships, not on the shifting grounds for sexual
politics the plague might bring forward. This point is one of the most
frustrating things about <em>Y: The Last Man</em>: it could have done so
much, but instead it is and always will be the story of how much women need
men and how much, if men were to disappear, women would become like men. For
all its potential, <em>Y: The Last Man</em> represents women, for the most
part, as idiotic, unable to control their own destiny. Women do everything
men would do and cling desperately to the notion that they will get pregnant.
The emphasis placed on breasts, whether present or lopped off, suggests a
male gaze in control of representing these curvacious, comic-book
stereotypes.

alt="" width="192" height="300" /></a>

	The literary critic Stanley Fish once noted that the reader of John
Milton's Paradise Lost--a subverted moral allegory if there ever was one,
albeit unintentionally--was "simultaneously a participant in the action and a
critic of his own performance" (i). The covers in the <em>Y: The Last Man
series</em>, all heavily indebted to the archetypes of pulp, resist the
story's potential as an enlightening glimpse into alternative spaces where
gender politics and morality as they are traditionally constructed might be
subverted. Instead, the comic relies on a mode of visual representation that
cultivates the allure of moral perversion. A world without men, it follows,
would be a perversion, but a perversion in which men benefited. The images of
the comic nullify any possibility of enlightened representation or discourse
in <em>Y: The Last Man</em> by asserting the visual trope of pulp that
prioritizes the male's voyeuristic gaze upon the feminine form as the
signifier for benign, even exciting, moral perversion; a situation in which
the only the female is objectified. All this despite the last man's lonely,
singular, and anxious position as object to be gazed upon in possession of
the forbidden fruit--one we never see lest it be judged--that will save the
human race from extinction. <p style="text-align: center;"><a

alt="My Y: The Last Man run" width="300" height="225" /></a> My "Y: The Last
Man" run[/caption]

	The first issue of Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra’s “Y the Last Man”
came out at the time that I was at the peak of my comic collecting, and from
the moment it was advertised (three months prior to its actual publication)
it was acknowledged as a guaranteed success solely because of its thesis: the
male population is decimated, and there is a single man left to represent and
continue humanity (published under DC’s “adults only” Vertigo imprint, no
less). Given the predominantly young male readership of comic books, it was a
formula that didn’t allow for much in the way of error; Vaughan could have
done nearly anything to the plot and the series would have been a best seller
if only because of this underlying principle. Surprisingly, however, he did
not take the easy way out and follow a lascivious, sex-soaked story of a man
taking advantage of being the last male on the planet. Even the characters
themselves are aware of this absence, as R.J. points out in issue 22: “You’ve
been the last cock on Earth for ages. How could you not bone one girl in that
whole time?” Instead, Vaughan capitalizes on the built-in audience and uses
the story as a vehicle for often poignant (though sometimes strangely
misogynistic) thoughts on gender dynamics, on his politically Democratic
leanings and on his thoughts on the Academy. It’s this final point that I
find most compelling now, in that Vaughan is so self-consciously literary
throughout Y while so openly disparaging of these elements at the same time:
Yorick, the Arts’ academic with his self acknowledged “useless BA” (12.11),
is presented as a generally static and dull character, important only in that
he has survived the plague by happenstance, though he is incredibly pompous
besides. He is consistently surprised at womankind’s ability to survive and
makes subtly sexist comments throughout the narrative. Despite being very
well read (a point that he draws attention to ad nauseum), his character is
confounding – one wonders why Vaughan would have left us with such a man, if
we were only allowed one, throughout his story.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/yorick.jpg"><img
class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1914"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/yorick.jpg" alt=""
width="262" height="192" /></a>That Yorick is an academic is a point that
Vaughan returns to repeatedly in Y, and in the most blatant of ways; not only
are he and his sister named after characters from Shakespeare (his father
being a Shakespeare professor), he refers to obscure works of literature
throughout the series, references that the vast majority of comic readers
would not get (mentioning Nathaniel West in issue 18 is a clear example).
There are other nods to the literary throughout Y, nearly in every issue, but
they’re so blunt that one wonders at the point that Vaughan is making – the
play within a play aside, a clear nod to Hamlet, serves no purpose other than
to delay the action for two issues. The snide mockery of those who haven’t
mastered a language is also an undercurrent of Y, and at times it’s
affronting; the Russian spy Natalya who can’t communicate in English states,
when allowed to express herself in her own language, “&lt;Thank Christ! I
sound like a fucking retard when I try to speak English!&gt;” (11.17). Of the
same woman, Yorick notes in a comical way, “Cookie monster speaks better
English than you” (13.11). In a story with so compelling a premise, Vaughan
keeps bringing us back to the import of communication in a way that seems of
little relevance to the central plot, openly belittling those who can't
communicate effectively.

	The references to language and texts become so consistent that their
meanings become ambiguous – issue 24 opens with Yorick entering a church,
stating “Are you there God? It’s me, Margaret,” followed in the next panel by
“Little Judy Blume humor for ya” (24.2). This line isn’t actually humorous,
and one wonders who the “ya” is here – Vaughan is attempting to, in a way
that is almost pedantic, drop in as many textual references as can be allowed
within his narrow page count regardless of their usefulness. Yorick, in the
same issue, when Beth attacks and lights him on fire, puts himself out while
explaining the correct grammatical usage of articles in a sentence. Being an
English guy, I’m all for instruction, but to place it so consistently and in
so unrealistic a way disrupts the narrative. In this universe, we have
characters discussing their thesis papers and majors set to a backdrop of the
potential annihilation of the human race. It’s also important to note that
the only other character who highlighted her academic degree is also the
first character he deems worthy of <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Berkeley1.jpg"><img
class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1919"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Berkeley1.jpg" alt=""
width="461" height="267" /></a>pursuing sexually, despite his loyalty to his
fiancée to this point in the narrative. Beth in turn continues this type of
academically-bent, unrealistic mindset when being attacked by Amazons, asking
“you were a theology major too, huh? Where at? Berkeley?” and then, snidely,
“yeah, I thought so” (25.17). When the conflict is over, she tells the woman
“you’re too smart to be running with those air-heads. When you figure that
out, you’re welcome to come back here.” Vaughan makes the same pitch to his
readers: read my work in the right context, and make sure to look up my
references.

	Though there are certainly quotable profundities scattered throughout Y
(“Once you make it past the scales and blindfold, justice is a woman with a
sword” from issue 9 being the most memorable for me), it is, at times,
overwhelmingly geared towards justifying itself as being most correctly
viewed in an academic context through its dialogue and obscure references, a
habit that followed Vaughan into his career in writing for the TV series
“Lost.” Moreover, the series is insistent on hyping itself – even by the
third issue, it was offering testimonials on its front cover that highlight
the fact that “it’s rare to find a comic with such universal appeal, and this
book is going to be the next big thing,” with similar quotations following
for the next twelve issues. Y the Last man remains a worthwhile read and is,
at points, a highly nuanced fable that explores gender construction in a
provocative way. It’s also, as is quite<a

of the typical graphic novel; apropos nothing, Agent 355 notes “they can say
Fuck in comic books? Jeez, they never said stuff like that in Superman”
(11.3). Vaughan offers us a compelling (if convoluted) 60 issue story that
seems bent on being as academically minded as possible in order to guarantee
discussion long after the story itself has been told in a way that mainstream
superhero storylines are rarely granted – the same tactics have been arguably
used throughout literature just as obviously, with <em>Finnegan’s Wake
</em>being a prime example. Yorick is a dull and generally static character
who is often self-deprecating, and while there is some everyman quality in
this, the literary references and consistent acknowledging of the import of
formal, academic education is too evident to be ignored. It’s also clear that
Vaughan’s style has paid off to this end, with a trilogy of films currently
on the edge of pre-production and his collected series earning new reprints
in expensive, deluxe hardcover editions. By avoiding the obvious approach to
his central concern given his market of predominantly adolescent males, he
offers us a story that is worthy of rereading in the classroom, even if the
self-conscious desire to be perceived as such is immediately visible in the
text.

following is a Guest Post by Ashley Olien who has recently completed the
Master of Liberal Studies Program at the University of Minnesota.  Her
Master's thesis, <em>How GLBTQ Characters are Depicted in Contemporary Comic
Book Fiction: Ethical Implications</em>, examines some of the ways that

about <em>Y: the Last Man</em>, <a

the-female-form-in-y-the-last-man-and-locas/" target="_blank">Peter

take a hard stance regarding Vaughn and Guerra’s representation of gender.
While I agree that this series both reflects and reinforces a long standing
fear of gender non-conformity and sexual freedom, I feel that these recent
posts have failed to take some important factors into consideration.

	In his book, <a
href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0613027825/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;
camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=0613027825&amp;linkCode=as2&
amp;tag=thedigcullab-20" target="_blank"><em>Understanding Comics: the
Invisible Art</em></a>, Scott McCloud uses the word “icon,” defining it for
his own purposes to mean “any image used to represent a person, place, thing
or idea” (McCloud 27). Essentially, what McCloud points out is that comic
book artists often rely on socially recognizable images that convey a large
amount of information despite their simplicity. Wilkins discusses this idea,
arguing that <em>Y: the Last Man</em> does not provide enough information to
give the reader a sense of the female characters as discrete individuals. He
argues that “Guerra’s images of women as complete individuals are indistinct”
and that the “bodies of all the female characters are more or less
indistinguishable.” While I agree that, in general, many of these women share
the same general body shape, the art provides plenty of other information
which helps the reader to distinguish one character from another.

	In <a
href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1578067197/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;
camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=1578067197&amp;linkCode=as2&
amp;tag=thedigcullab-20" target="_blank"><em>Alternative Comics: An Emerging
Literature</em></a>, Charles Hatfield quotes Perry Nodelman who claims that,
with regard to picture books, “all visual images, even the most apparently
representational ones, … require a knowledge of learned competencies and
cultural assumptions before they can be rightly understood” (Hatfield 37).
Comic book artists use images which are easily understood by the general
public. They often depend on stereotypes to help define characters as certain
<em>types</em> of people. For example, an artist may use hairstyles, clothing
or other visual cues to help the reader quickly identify the race, gender and
sexual orientation of a character. Essentially, stereotypes become a type of
shorthand which allows the artist to communicate efficiently with the reader.

	The image that Wilkins chooses to provide as an example happens to be one
of a character who is a former super model. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/image00-
e1346174479875.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-1933" title="Y: The Last
Man"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/image00-
e1346174479875.png" alt="" width="180" height="283" /></a>Wilkins completely
neglects to mention all of the many images where characters with more variant
gender identities are portrayed. Agent 355, for example, is almost always
portrayed as very masculine. In this piece of cover art Agent 355 is dressed,
as usual, in a bulky black jacket and black pants. Her hair is pulled back
into braids, highlighting her square and masculine facial structure. In her
left hand she is holding a gun. Each of these features provides the reader
with a piece of information that helps them to interpret her as a certain
<em>type</em> of woman. This distinction becomes even more clear when her
image is contrasted with that of Dr. Mann, who is shown to be far more
feminine. This piece of art is consistent with the way that these two
characters are depicted through much of the series (a discussion of Agent
355’s growing femininity is, perhaps, best left for another time).

	As we have been discussing Agent 355’s masculinity, I think it is also
important to point out that <em>Y: The Last Man</em> addresses not only the
traditional gender binary (A gender system that classifies sex and gender as
two distinct categories: male and female), but also introduces the idea of
gender variance. Sex and gender are major components of the plot. The
“Gendercide” is an event in which all mammals with a Y chromosome are killed
off. The term itself conveys a strong message. “Gendercide” refers neither to
social gender nor the existence of sex organs, but to the most basic idea of
what constitutes male or female. Whether a character exhibits complex gender
identity or complex sexuality is of no significance. Having an X or Y
chromosome is the only factor that determines whether or not someone in this
story will survive. This is problematic because it minimizes the complexity
of what has come to be known as gender identity.

	In his book, <em>Imagining Transgender: an Ethnography of a
Category</em>, David Valentine lays out the ways that the term “transgender”
has evolved and grown into an umbrella category that encompasses multiple
gender identities. There are several instances in which <em>Y: the Last
Man</em> attempts to represent characters who could be identified as
transgender. One place where gender variance is shown is in the ninth book,
<em>Motherland</em>. Here, two women come across a man in a cemetery. One of
the women exclaims, “it’s a <strong>guy</strong>! We found a <strong>real
guy</strong>!” (Vaughn, 9. 99). This comment is problematic because it
implies that there is something specific that marks a person as rightly
belonging to one gender or another. The two women, shown wielding shovels,
appear threatening and clearly frighten the man. Afraid of what could happen,
the man exclaims, “No! I’m a <strong>working girl</strong>. I’ll rip off the
stupid goatee if you don’t believe me. I swear, I just dress up like men for
other <strong>women</strong>!” (Vaughn, 9. 99). One of the women, then,
responds by saying, “back up, you <strong>pretend</strong> to be part of the
patriarchy?” (Vaughn, 9.100). This comment suggests that to display a gender
identity contrary to one’s sex at birth is to pretend. This situation
suggests that there is something wrong and not genuine about the way the
character, and the real people being represented, perform gender. While there
are many issues with this depiction, its very existence demonstrates a
complexity that seems to have been neglected in the previous posts.

	While I do not always agree with the way that some of the characters are
represented, I do believe that Vaughn and Guerra have done a brilliant job of
exposing some of the problems that our society experiences when representing
gender identities. In fact, I so strongly disagree with Wright’s statement
that “it could have done so much, but instead it is and always will be the
story of how much women need men” that I question whether or not we read the
same series. <p style="text-align: center;">Works Cited</p> <p

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I am known for my
catchy post titles, readers.

	In Scott's post on <em>Y</em>, <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2012/08/21/80-self-consciously-academic-
brian-k-vaughan-pushing-y-the-last-man/">he talked about the self-consciously
academic nature of the text</a>.  It was an interesting post, but I think he
missed one of the most interesting metatextual/pseudo-academic debates in the
text that all centres around a lighter Yorick carries and the symbolism it
embodies.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/photo-1-copy.jpg"><
img class="alignnone  wp-image-1957" title="photo-1 copy"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/photo-1-copy.jpg"
alt="" width="1305" height="991" /></a>

	This moment comes about in Book 3, <em>One Small</em>
<em>Step</em>,<em> </em>and I think two important things are happening here.

	First, Vaughan is using Yorick to allude to the debate of nomenclature in
the world of comics scholarship.  While I think now most everyone has agreed
not to care so much, for a time there (around 2002 when <em>Y: The Last
Man </em>was first published), anxiety about having comics scholarship taken
seriously meant that we all sat around a lot of conference tables having a
lot of largely pointless discussions about whether or not it was okay to call
them comics or if we had to call them graphic novels or if they were really
something altogether different entirely.  Yorick's ironizing of the term
"graphic novel" (by using quotation marks) and his clarification that what he
means is, in fact and of course, a "comic book," speaks to the apparent
silliness of such a debate.  The anxieties were those of critics, not comic
producers or consumers, ostensibly; Yorick feels silly saying "graphic novel"
and knows that the clear and comprehensible term is comic book.

	Second, the comic book Yorick is alluding to is a series called
<em>Preacher</em> by Garth Ennis.   In <em>Preacher</em>, which ran from
1995-2000, Jesse Custer is a Texas preacher who gets possessed by an entity
that causes the destruction of his church and his congregation.  This
possession, complicatedly both evil and good in equal measure, make Custer
incredibly powerful and sets him on a path to find God.

	So why the lighter?  It's an incredibly masculinized symbol
in <em>Preacher</em>, and stands similarly in <em>Y: The Last Man</em>.
 In <em>Preacher</em>, the lighter had belonged to Custer's father -- a man
murdered before Custer's eyes when he was six.  So there's a patrilineal
heritage to the lighter that places it in a very masculine space.  Custer's
father received the lighter when he was serving in Vietnam, to amp up the
dudeliness quotient and little more, and was a gift from John Wayne, if we
just want to get ridiculous and stupid about the Y-chromosomal nature of the
lighter.  It's a boy thing, okay?  Passed down from boy to boy to boy forever
and ever, from the boyest boy who ever boyed, John Wayne.

	And now Yorick has it.

	This effectively ties Yorick to an alpha-male history in contemporary
comic book narratives.  So if you weren't sure that Yorick is the manly man
to man up this manless situation, you are now.  He carries a talisman of his
masculinity that gives him six degrees of separation from John Wayne, for
goodness sake.

	Which gets at the heart of what annoys me about <em>Y: The Last Man</em>.
 It's a rollicking good story most of the time and a lot of fun, but if
Vaughan thinks he's created some kind of feminist text he's out of his mind.
 I really wanted the female characters to have some kind of power but they
don't really.  They probably needed a penis lighter of their
own.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[The universe had been
trying to get me to look at some Eddie Campbell comics for some time now and
has finally succeeded.

	A year or so ago, a friend and colleague gave me a copy of <em>From
Hell</em>, the version of the Jack the Ripper story that Alan Moore wrote and
Campbell illustrated. I’m ashamed to say that I have yet to read it. The
cover image did not strike me at the time as my cup of tea: all blood and
gore. But my recent experience reading <em>Alec: The Years Have Pants</em>
suggests that I will be getting to it soon.

	Then I read Jared Gardner’s “Storylines” in <em>SubStance</em>, an
article that probes the notion of the comic book artist’s style or “line” in
which Gardner analyzes Campbell’s work in <em>From Hell</em> and
<em>Alec</em>, stating that “Campbell’s line is like Hemingway’s prose
style—distinctly his own no matter what he writes…” (62). By this Gardner
does not mean that Campbell’s work is always the same, just that once you’ve
seen it, if you see it again, you know it. Campbell’s style varies
tremendously through the <em>Alec</em> omnibus, but it remains his.

	When I was at the 3rd International Conference on Comics in Bournemouth
in June, a colleague I met there, <a title="http://www.damonherd.com/"
href="http://www.damonherd.com/" target="_blank">Damon Herd</a>, recommended
that I pay a visit to <a title="http://www.goshlondon.com/"
href="http://www.goshlondon.com/" target="_blank">Gosh Comics</a> in London
and made an aside that <a title="http://hayleycampbell.com/"
href="http://hayleycampbell.com/" target="_blank">Hayley Campbell</a>, Eddie
Campbell’s daughter, ran the Gosh Comics twitter feed.

	Also at that conference was <a title="http://www.paulgravett.com/"
href="http://www.paulgravett.com/" target="_blank">Paul Gravett</a>, who
figures prominently in <em>Alec</em>. I recall chatting with Paul on the
stairs of the Bournemouth University Executive Centre and him saying, “The
stairs are our friend.” Now when I picture that moment, I imagine it drawn by
Eddie Campbell. I knew Gravett from the big book he edited, <em>1001 Comics
You Must Read Before You Die</em>, but reading <em>Alec</em> made me see what
a pivotal figure Gravett has been in the comics scene in the UK since the
1980’s, with his <em>Fast Fiction</em> book stall and <em>Escape</em>
magazine.

	&nbsp;

	Once I started reading <em>Alec</em>, Damon and another friend whom I met
at a conference, <a title="http://pepoperez.blogspot.ca/"
href="http://pepoperez.blogspot.ca/" target="_blank">Pepo Perez</a>, had a
good twitter conversation about what we liked about Eddie Campbell. The
discussion mostly turned on two things: the “scratchy,” “rough and ready”
quality of Campbell’s line, and Campbell’s relationship to superhero comics.

	Campbell’s style could never be called “clear line”. Rather it appears in
a rough and sketchy pen and ink style. In <em>Kitchen Sink Grafitti</em>, for
instance, Campbell draws loosely, with less concern for outline than for the
volume and proportions of bodies and objects. Perfect scribbles is one way of
thinking of the drawings. Consider this bike.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-

09-at-8.59.21-PM.png" alt="" width="165" height="384" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	Eddie Campbell knows how to draw bikes. Damon said that after spending a
day trying to draw a bike, he really appreciated this cartoon.

	Because Campbell is the master of proportion and volume, the drawings
never look amateurish, but they do manage to convey the idea of a life lived
and recorded quickly, as if Campbell had to rush to get things down in order
to get on to the next event in his life. The extra scratchy, scribbly quality
of <em>Graffiti Kitchen</em> matches the “lost in the wilderness” aspect of
Alec’s life at the moment: he’s carrying on with an artist, Jane, and her
daughter, George, at the same time.

	Campbell uses this series to not only tell his own story but the story of
comics also: the story of how he fits into the history of comics. A key
moment is when young Eddie (I believe Campbell has given up the "Alec" name
at this point) is in hospital after being struck by a car. When the nurse
hands out comics, he gets <em>The Beano</em> while the boy in the next bed
gets a copy of <em>Strange Tales.</em> The grass, of course, is greener on
the other side, and when the boy falls asleep, Eddie goes over and examines
the comic, falling in love with Lee and Kirby’s style. The rest is history.

	So Campbell is yet another comics artist whose mileu is autobiographical
and/or ‘indie’ comics who deliberately invokes the superhero history of
comics by making frequent reference to them. Unlike Chris Ware, say, Campbell
makes no bones about his relationship to the superhero comic as the “other”
of more “serious” comics. It is a source of unadulterated pleasure for him,
and one of Campbell’s refreshing qualities is his big tent vision of comics.
Several panels in <em>How to be an Artist</em> are simulacra of other
artists’ work: from Milton Caniff to Art Spiegelman.

	Eddie Campbell seems quite happy to situate himself at the crossroads of
all the different styles of comics, even though his home in Brisbane,
Australia makes this crossroads stylistic and ecumenical rather than
geographic. If you fused Paul Gravett and Eddie Campbell, you would have some
kind of comics superhero. One man spreading the gospel, the other
illustrating it with the keen eye of the court sketcher.

Who&#039;s Writing &#034;Inside Woody Allen&#034;?</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[The answer to the
question in the title of this post is Stuart Hample, who wrote and
illustrated the daily / weekly strip from 1976 to 1984. The premise was
simple, take the persona of Woody Allen—the one you know from movies,
befuddled redhead anxiety attack with glasses—and transfer it to the comics
strip page. Hample received permission from Allen to produce the comic and,
according to Hample, Allen was loosely involved in its production, often
sending in one-liners or full jokes to be used in the serialized strip. <p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/allen_01.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter  wp-image-1999" title="allen_01"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/allen_01-1024x334.jpg
" alt="" width="614" height="200" /></a></p> My interest in the strip locates
itself not around Woody Allen per se, but how the strip enacts some
interesting problems associated with reading comics (strips or novels). The
first is the obvious question of authorship, as the title suggests. Who
exactly is writing “Inside Woody Allen”? Hample comes up with the bulk of the
material, but the persona in which that material materializes (sorry) is
already well-formed and worked through. Anyone who listens to Allen’s
nightclub act from the mid 1960s cannot help but be impressed with the
already fully formed persona that would later become irrevocably attached to
Allen himself. The pity one-liners, the intelligence of the routines (Kant,
Weber, Marx, all mentioned), and the self-depricating, self-referential,
deconstruction that leads to the punch-line. All these elements are present
in Hample’s strip, which leads me to ask: who’s writing? <p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/allen_02.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter  wp-image-2001" title="allen_02"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/allen_02-1024x320.jpg
" alt="" width="614" height="192" /></a></p> Of course, the above creative
trajectory is not isolated to “Inside Woody Allen.” Plainly, it mimics all
comicbook writing that takes place within the tradition itself: superheroes,
memoir, even those “for beginners” books. The characters within the comics
canon are, for the most part, near fully formed when they are taken up by new
authors who, while certainly re-writing and adding their own slant to the
traditional character, must write within established paradigms. To put it
baldly, they have to respond to the established routine by at the very least
acknowledging it. While Hample takes an actual living person as his
inspiration—and subject—he still must acknowledge and immerse himself in the
mimicry of the Woody Allen mythological character before proceeding. And, to
some extend, the audience needs to be in on the joke--they have to be aware
of, even steeped in Woody Allen's delivery, persona, and references. That
creative process, one steeped in learning about the subject to be represented
rather than inventing it,  is a very “modern” way of myth-making. What
“Inside Woody Allen” illustrates, well ahead of its time, is a kind of modern
myth-making in which the persona means more than the individual; the routine
more than the nobility of the deed or the lessons it teaches. We move away
from myth as repeated story to myth as repeated motif, and in the process we
read ourselves and our cultural production differently. In an odd twist given
the Woody Allen as subject motif, myth-making becomes more self-referential,
more historically bound, and more susceptable to shifting cultural currents.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/allen_04.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter  wp-image-2002" title="allen_04"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/allen_04-1024x698.jpg
" alt="" width="614" height="419" /></a></p> What “Inside Woody Allen” and
indeed most comics show is the transience of myth; its adapatability and its
mutations, rather than its moral certainty. We become conditioned to accept
variations in the routine, almost without bounds (Britney Spears starting
working on a whole new level when she shaved her head, but she was still
working). “Inside Woody Allen” had better not represent entirely the Woody
Allen we've already seen, or else we’re not interested. But, he better not be
too different than the Woody Allen we've come to expect.

	The same dichotomy is visible, to some extent, in any “re-writing” of
stable comics characters or within the reformulation of consistent
narratives. We are always jazzed by something like <em>The Dark Knight
Returns</em> or <em>Civil War,</em> but it’s still Batman, and it’s still
classic. Even something as innovative as <em>Watchmen </em>(itself in the
midst of a re-write) is locked within its own mythology, the mythology of
superheroes, and the mythologies of detective fiction. The most succinct way
to put things might be to say that reading comics is about waiting for the
punch line: the inevitable, but unexpected, arrival at an end-point from
which we will begin again. That “Inside Woody Allen” managed an eight-year
run by repeating Allen’s stand-up motifs from the ten years before the
strip’s creation is testiment to the power of the consistent set-up. And,
it’s a short step from such statements to iconic images of repetition in
comics such as George Herriman’s brick, Batman’s cowl, or Art Speigleman’s
cats and mice.

	To put all this in perspective is to say that comics represent some of
the most stable historiographies in modern life. The mythologies they create
and represent, no matter how up-to-date, necessarily call forth the past from
which they are born no matters the variables or transmutations. Moreover,
that past is irrevocably connected to whatever new storyline, punchline, or
representation that emerges, forever bringing forward and alluding to
previous acts. "Inside Woody Allen" re-writes Woody Allen not as an
individual or even as a persona, but as a immutable myth endlessly riffing on
a theme; immortality by not dying indeed.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[When I first arrived at
Graphixia, it was to write about Chester Brown's <em>Louis Riel</em> as a
work of Canadian literature.  (<a title="#18 Louis Riel’s Legacy"
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2011/04/01/louis-riels-legacy/">You can
read that post here</a>.)  That was almost 70 Graphixia posts ago now, and I
thought I'd take the opportunity of this theme-less round of posting to
revisit Chester Brown and his work, this time looking at his
autobiographical <em>I Never Liked You</em>, which tells the story of Brown's
teen years and his attempts to cope with both his own crippling introversion
and his mother's progressing schizophrenia.  It's a heavy read, but it's also
considered one of the best graphic novels of all time by wise and enlightened
people like Gilbert Hernandez and the folks at Comics Journal.  I thought it
might be time we take another look at Chester Brown's work.

	At heart, this is a coming-of-age story, albeit a
coming-of-age-in-difficult-circumstances story (though aren't they all).
 Hanging over the narrative is Brown's mother, a tragic figure who seems to
just exist on the edges of being whole and human in protagonist Chester's
life.  She is simultaneously an oppressive figure (her admonishments about
the use of foul language seem to effectively silence Chester's interactions
with his peers and damage his relationships with other people his age) and a
fragile one (she is on the edges of illness throughout the narrative, and
dies in absentia while Chester and his brother are visiting their
grandparents).  But she is, above anything else, emblematic of Chester's
inability to express himself emotionally.

	The title of the novel is <em>I Never Liked You</em>, which is hurled at
Chester by a scorned life-long crush, but it's Chester's own battle with the
phrase "I Love You" that forms the crux of the conflict in the novel.  And
what one does with such a declaration once it has been made is equally
puzzling for Chester.  It's relatively easy for him to blurt out his love,
sputtering and teenaged as it is, but what comes after?  The intimacy of
dating, the aspect of trying new things, is more than he can bear -- and
perhaps too the sense that love, as <a href="http://vimeo.com/41925151">the
philosopher John Mayer tells us</a>, "is a verb /  It ain't a thing."  It's
the action aspect of his love for Skye that he finds so difficult to work
out.

	<img class="alignleft"
src="http://autobdgraphie.fr/sites/autobdgraphie.fr/images/images/chester%
20brown%20jamais%20aim%C3%A9%201.img_assist_custom.jpg" alt="" width="400"
height="204" />

	With his mother, he can't express his love in either words or actions.
 His restraint is partly imposed by her volatility and discomfort in her own
skin, but also by his own lack of a sense of his role within the family.  As
the eldest son, he feels a sense of responsibility.  Crippled by his painful
introversion, he fears anything that takes him out of his comfort zone
(which, incidentally, is not that comfortable for our tortured soul --
depicted here by the use of the heavy, imposing black background that blots
out anything in his non-interior life).  So when she asks him to cycle to the
Metro to pick up hamburger meat, he refuses, upsetting and alienating his
mother and angering his little brother who is forced to fulfill his older
brother's role.  And then, when he visits her on her deathbed, he finds
himself unable to express his love in words.  He's unaware that it's his last
chance to tell his mother that he loves her, and he squanders it, which is
the central trauma of the text.

	Chester is a complex protagonist in that readers are not really sure
whether or not he wants to be rescued or released from this world or not.  He
seems at peace with his disconnection and not terribly troubled by it; in the
end, I think that's what makes the narrative compelling -- Chester is an
everyman, plagued by demons that ultimately bring him comfort and encourage
his complacency. At the end of the text, he is 17 and Skye, the object of his
crush, is 15 -- she asks him to go to the fair, and he says no.  He needs to
mow the lawn, he says, and then listen to the new KISS album.  He is left, at
the end of the text, alone in his silo -- and there's something likable in
him in that.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[As this is a
free-for-all month at Graphixia, I wanted to turn to what I’m perceiving as a
current trend in the big two publishers: the nature of villainy, in
mainstream superhero comics, is changing dramatically. From Classics
Illustrated onwards, comics have been pedagogical tools, used primarily for
the delivery of morality through black and white, binaristic perspectives of
right and wrong. We see these largely in the characters of early Captain
America and Superman, along with their nemeses Red Skull and Lex Luthor,
though comicdom in general is founded on these moral tales – the early heroes
always had their foils in the foreground, ready to serve as the antithetical
response to the how the reader was meant to react when faced with a moral
decision.

	The summer blockbuster “eve<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/whoseside.jpg"><img
class="wp-image-2019 alignright"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/whoseside-225x300.jpg
" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>nts” of the past few years, however,
have upset the binaries that superhero comics were founded on, problematizing
their use as morality texts in potentially very productive ways. Early
crossover events, such as Infinity Gauntlet or Crisis on Infinite Earths, had
villains at their cores (Thanos and the Anti-Monitor respectively) with whom
it was impossible to identify – their goals were always the destruction of
their universes or simple genocide, forcing the reader to read with the
heroes’ aims of foiling their devious plots. From Civil War onwards though,
this trend towards guiding reader response has shifted to demand more of the
reader, leaving ambiguity in place of the previous moral binary. Civil War, a
text that literally asked in its promotional materials, “whose side are you
on?”, pitted Iron Man and Captain America against one another in a contest
that was politically charged; it came to blows, as comics do, though the
heart of the conflict centred on registration of superheroes in order to make
them accountable for their actions and the potential destruction they cause
while fighting their nemeses. This plot, offered against the backdrop of the
institution of the Patriot Act in the United States, refused to offer a
discernible position. Gone, arguably for the first time in a summer event,
was the impetus to guide the reader to a predictable conclusion. Gone as well
was the heavy handed, singular morality, with each crossover demonstrating
the various authors’ political leanings.

age that plays to moral ambiguity, often ignoring traditional villains
altogether to pursue stories that involve readers more and make them question
their own values when engaging with the characters. Siege, Marvel’s event
from two years ago, proposed a similar conflict as was delivered in Civil
War, with Harry Osborne (the “reformed” Green Goblin), legally in charge of
Marvel’s version of the FBI in his nation-wide task force H.A.M.M.E.R. Though
the details of the crossover event are too varied to be discussed here, the
theme was again political in nature: a hard, Republican right represented by
the very effective Osborne regime, with the more Democrat leaning Avengers
who had been driven underground by the change in government structure. Though
Osborne eventually snaps under the pressure of his position and power returns
to the heroes, the storyline echoed through the Marvel Universe throughout
the following year, notably in the mini-series followup “Osborne,” begging
readers to continue to juxtapose the shifting worldviews of the fictional
world of Marvel comics with their own, media-skewed and uncertain political
environments.

	This hesitant moral structure in superhero comics’ events is still in
full swing, this summer in the crossover “Avengers vs X-Men.” While there is
certainly a blockbuster feel to the storyline (as evidenced by the parallel
mini-series “Vs” that simply offers fights without plots) the series again
shows the ambiguous turn in comics’ morality. Though the series is currently
running and its conclusion still uncertain, the crux of this conflict centres
on the individual freedom of a mutant girl, Hope Summers, who is about to be
possessed by a<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/avx.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-full wp-image-2017"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/avx.jpg" alt=""
width="949" height="946" /></a> lethal, possibly uncontrollable force from
the cosmos that has the potential to eradicate humankind. While the
human-but-powered Avengers want to contain the threat by imprisoning Hope and
thereby stop the impending disaster, the mutant X-Men see the possessing
force as a means of rebooting their dying species while touting Hope’s right
to individual freedom. That both sides of the conflict are represented by
"heroes" means that the reader is drawn not to the traditional good versus
evil but must make up his own mind as to where he stands regarding the
morally complex issue of sacrificing personal freedom for the greater good -
most significant is that both sides of the argument are legitimate, depending
on the reader's personal views. The series is, again, still running as of
this posting, and is worth reading if only for the intellectual appeals it
makes to its readers.

	Perhaps this trend towards complexity and upsetting traditional moral
binaries simply shows that superhero comics’ readership is aging and has had
its fill of the predictable pedagogical tales of the past. Possibly, however,
this turn is indicative of changing expectations of media more generally: as
entertainment becomes progressively more interactive and socially driven, a
storyline that makes demands of its readers regarding how to respond
emotionally to the events of the text may be anachronistic, a product of an
earlier age. These new summer events, in which the big two invest so much of
their resources and which represent the bulk of their annual sales,
intentionally lead the reader to question his or her personal worldview by
offering morally ambiguous situations that defy the use of comics as simple
instructional tools on right and wrong. Regardless of the reasons behind the
shift in storytelling, the nature of these complex plots and their open-ended
resolutions beg the question as to whether popular comics are on the cusp of
an academic turn more generally by eschewing moral certainties for greater
reader investment – in this new world, today’s villain may be yesterday’s
hero, and the moral of the story lies within you, not any artificial arbiter
of right and wrong.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[This month at Graphixia
we are writing about webcomics. While concerns abound about the fate of the
comics publishing industry, and newspapers fail daily, webcomics are slowly
gaining ground as a possible destiny of the medium. One of the most popular
webcomics is <em>Oglaf</em>, a sword and sorcery pornographic comedy; or as
the Australian creators Trudy Cooper and Doug Bayne write, “This comic
started out as an attempt to make pornography. It degenerated into sex comedy
pretty much immediately.” But <em>Oglaf</em> looks like it could be a Sunday
full-colour newspaper comic, apart from its overt sexual themes and explicit
depiction. Because Cooper and Bayne update <em>Oglaf</em> every Sunday, we
can view it as the flagship Sunday comic of the internet universe, where the
moral restrictions of the “family newspaper” hold no sway.

	The internet hasn’t exactly changed the content of sexual representation,
which has always been around, including erotic comics by artists like Guido
Crepax. There is nothing new under the sun. But what the internet has changed
is the relationship between the world of that representation and the world of
conventional media. The world of “porn” exists not beneath a veil of
repression, or compartmentalized behind the secret room of the “Adult”
section of the video store, but is instead a “parallel” world on the web,
existing next to, not beneath, conventional media. We don’t even have to hide
ourselves away to access it. While I’ve seen a lot of twitter commentary
chastising people reading <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> openly on public
transit, generally the sense is that the Kindle and the iPad allow us to
inhabit the world of the “family newspaper” bodily, while our minds can
inhabit erotic realms that technology makes possible.

	<em>Oglaf</em> revels in its status as the internet porn version of the
Sunday comic. For example its “Not Safe for Work” warning mocks the legal
status of such warnings: “Please click on the button below to certify you’re
over 18. Of course if you are under 18, you can’t legally certify anything.
So if you’re a minor, please get a parent or guardian to click the button
which says you aren’t. Thankyou.” The image of the latex clad woman with the
riding crop offers ancillary encouragement.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-
08-at-8.27.52-PM-e1349934440319.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium
wp-image-2031" title="Screen Shot 2012-10-08 at 8.27.52 PM"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-
2012-10-08-at-8.27.52-PM-245x300.png" alt="" width="245" height="300" /></a>

	Oglaf pokes fun at the way we try to convince ourselves that the boundary
between the porn world of the internet and the conventional moral sphere
still functions. The rotating jokes that introduce the comics include lines
like, “Don’t punish me for loving you. That’s the court’s job” and “All
models are over 18. Or over 21 where required by law.”

	<em>Oglaf</em> plays with the quasi-veiledness of our fetishes and
fantasies. In the comic’s take on <em>One Thousand and One Nights</em>
Scheherazade makes her story interesting to herself by fantasizing about men
making love while telling the story of a man and a woman:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-
08-at-3.57.23-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2034"

08-at-3.57.23-PM.png" alt="" width="679" height="307" /></a>

;

	But perhaps the most interesting feature of the <em>Oglaf</em> world is
the control the female characters exert over sexuality. The main thread
revolves around the Mistress, who practices magic, and her hapless
apprentice, Ivan. The Mistress toys with and torments Ivan, who never appears
to learn any skills. She has cast a spell on him so that every time he
masturbates, he releases a “cumsprite” who immediately runs to the mistress
to tell on him for a special reward:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-
10-at-8.49.25-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2036"
title="Screen Shot 2012-10-10 at 8.49.25 PM"

10-at-8.49.25-PM.png" alt="" width="511" height="263" /></a>

	The piratical Vanka uses her sexual powers against both men and women in
ways that assert her control of the phallus. And when the conventional male
hero fails to save a town by melting the Snow Queen with his lovemaking—his
penis breaks off because of the cold–the mercenary Greir takes over with a
strap-on dildo to claim the reward. She then straps the dildo onto the man
who lost his penis and walks out of town with her sack of gold.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-
10-at-8.38.23-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2037"
title="Screen Shot 2012-10-10 at 8.38.23 PM"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-
10-at-8.38.23-PM.png" alt="" width="391" height="281" /></a>

	This sexual empowerment of the female characters is perhaps the main
distinction between <em>Oglaf</em> and old-fashioned erotic comics. Female
agency is fun and funny in <em>Oglaf.</em>

	The main source of humour is Cooper and Bayne inverting and/or disrupting
the tropes of fairy tales and myth, adapting them to porn comedy and
breathing new life into them. My favourite examples are the sweary dwarves of
“One Sleep ’Til Princemas,” whose speech patterns immediately invoke a
certain masculine type:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-
08-at-4.04.14-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2039"
title="Screen Shot 2012-10-08 at 4.04.14 PM"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-
08-at-4.04.14-PM.png" alt="" width="777" height="630" /></a>

	The freedom with which Cooper and Bayne play with sexual imagery and
concepts invites a re-consideration of the role of the sexual imagination in
the “Big Two” comics. The pneumatic women and bulked up men of the super-hero
world start to look as if their bodies are overblown with pent up sexual
repression. If anything like what goes on in Oglaf were to enter their world,
they would pop like pricked balloons.]]></content:encoded>

Dark+Knight+Rises+-+Rain+Poster" alt="" width="274" height="412" />...
prepare to have the fun sucked out of your favourite franchise.

	Ok, maybe not, but this is not a gushing, glowing review of <em>The Dark
Knight Rises</em>.  It is a deeply confused review of the film.  I will
endeavour not to include too much in the way of spoilers, but you might want
to wait to read this until you've seen the film, if only because I don't want
to impose my philosophical reading of the film on your experience of it.

	So, it's a movie about Occupy Wall Street, right?

	More specifically, it's a movie about rich white Hollywood's anxieties
about Occupy Wall Street, right?

	I'm not the first person to make this observation, but even without
having read the reviews discussing the parallels I found myself so distracted
by the ham-fisted use of Occupy imagery that I couldn't fall into the story
as I expected to.  The film shows us just how misunderstood the rich are;
they're usurious, sure, and they oppress and suppress without really knowing
that they're doing it.  But what we find out once they're overthrown is that
they were really saving us from ourselves all along.  Because poor people go
evil *fast*.  Like you've got no idea how many people poor people would
murder if they got half a chance.

	The villains of this picture have risen from poverty specifically to kick
ass, take names, and destroy World Order.  There is no framework in this
narrative where the world can be restructured from below and have a positive
outcome.

	Also, visually, let's represent felons as protestors -- let's conflate
those two worlds.  Also, when we let wrongly imprisoned people out of jail,
they're still evil.  Just in case you were wondering.

	The writers say <a
href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1690715/dark-knight-rises-occupy-wall-
street.jhtml">the connections weren't intentional</a> -- of course they
weren't.  That's how cultural anxieties get worked out on the screen.  That's
why Godzilla is really about nuclear war and King Kong is about cultural
others and Twilight is about anxieties relating to the power of feminism.
 <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> demonstrates just how deeply anxiety about
class warfare has permeated popular consciousness.

	Batman is about justice, whether justice aligns with the rule of law or
not.  Perhaps that's why I found it so frustrating to watch a retelling of
Batman's story that seems so careful to infer that, once empowered to act for
themselves, the collective 99% are a bunch of fucking morons.  And that only
Gotham's wealthy patron and caretaker -- even once brought low by the
selfish, thoughtless poor people -- can rescue the city and save the people.
 The benevolence of the elite.  They're just better than us.

	There are some beautiful performances in this film; Joseph Gordon Leavitt
and Anne Hathaway are tremendous additions to the franchise, and the film
ends on a letter-perfect note for fans of recent developments in the comics.
 The explosions are fantastic and the cinematography is exquisite.  But the
confused and problematic politics undermine the positive aspects of the film
to leave the end result muddled and unsatisfying.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I didn't see this at all, Brenna, but I can see
it now.  Your interpretation of The Dark Knight Rises is brilliant.  Your
interpretation reveals your enviable knowledge of politics, sociology,
psychology, and the media.  But I must say I saw something else.

	Because I read different books and have a different field of reference, I
have a different sense of what this film may have been about besides a
fantastically loud future that contains an awesome flying machine stabled in
the black, wet basement of a stately home occupied by two amazingly lucky
characters whose lives contrast so dramatically the hapless lives of those
who struggle to rise (including Batman for a while, which shows no one is
safe from haplessness) from a well in which they have been  thrown by those
who hate and fear them.

	What a terrifyingly delightful thing it is to go to a movie: to step out
of the sun and enter a dark room where such scary alternative world, vaguely
representing aspects of our own, can be experienced for awhile.  But how
meaningful is it intended to be?

	I can see that this film may have a theme, although I'm not convinced
that sending a message was its main purpose.  If I think about what that
theme might be, I'd say it was the problem of action: the problem of
manifesting an ideal in the field of time.  Whenever one has an idea and puts
it into action, there will be results, some that the initiator may be able to
control, some which s/he may not...and these unforeseen and often terrible
results of a well-intentioned idea can be devastating to oneself and
others...sometimes many, many others.  Batman, we learn at the very
beginning, arrested his active life for a long time because he recognized his
power created problems he had not intended to create.  He recognized that
action is dangerous.

	This made me like Batman.  He was great and he was humble.  He'd become a
wise non-agent...but he stepped off his safe pedestal of non-agency to try to
change things for the better one more time.  That he died doing "a far, far
better thing" saved him from any negative consequences of his action.

	In sum, I enjoyed the fantasy.  I'm 61.  I went with my son who's 27, who
enjoyed the action.  Is it not wonderful to go to the pictures and enjoy the
same film differently?]]></wp:comment_content>

Caricature, and the Female Form in Y the Last Man and Locas</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Every few months
Graphixians meet to determine our themes and texts for the upcoming posts.
While this thinking ahead produces stability and coherence, it also produces
frustration, because we often find something other than the assigned theme or
text that captures our interest more than it does. The phenomenon is like
having to read books for a class when we would rather be reading something
else. This preamble is a long way of saying that while I'm supposed to be
writing about Brian K. Vaughn and Pia Guerra's <em>Y the Last Man</em>, I
really want to discuss Jaime Hernandez' <em>Locas</em> series of <em>Love and
Rockets</em>. So I'm going to cheat a bit by discussing <em>Y the Last
Man</em> in relation to Locas on the theme of gender and representation,
particularly on iconicity, caricature and the female form. <p
style="text-align: left;">DC's recent teaser of a <em>Catwoman</em> cover has
instigated a familiar discussion in the comics criticism world of the
depiction of women superheroes as sexualized fantasy objects, pneumatic porn
actresses in skintight costumes. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/jvpqb-357x550.jpeg">
<img class="size-medium wp-image-1845 aligncenter" title="jvpqb-357x550"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/jvpqb-357x550-194x300
.jpeg" alt="" width="194" height="300" /></a>We have participated in this
discussion on Graphixia before. While Catwoman's pose on the cover has been
described as unrealistic or even impossible, arguments about “realism” are
vexed when it comes to superhero comics or science fiction stories. The
discussion is reminiscent of arguments about Barbie dolls; they are less
about reality than about the suitability of icons. "Is Barbie or Catwoman an
appropriate icon for contemporary femininity?" is the real question. In this
context, iconicity has to do with ideals and what we can identify with, not
with what we actually are.</p>


	[caption id="attachment_1848" align="aligncenter" width="295"]<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/mccloud11.jpeg"><img
class=" wp-image-1848" title="mccloud11"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/mccloud11.jpeg"
alt="" width="295" height="288" /></a> (36)[/caption] <p style="text-align:
left;">Icons and iconicity are key to our understanding of comic books. Scott
McCloud argues in <em>Understanding Comics</em> that the more iconic an image
of a person or face is, the more the audience can identify with it. The less
the image looks like a specific person, the more the viewer can put him or
herself in the picture, so to speak. For McCloud, an icon is an image drained
of specificity. The image of the character must be recognizable as a person
but not one that would alienate the viewer or disallow him or herself from
imagining being that person. This idea is a puzzling one, as it suggests that
stick figures or the images that indicate who may enter what toilet are the
ones we most identify with.</p> Furthermore, the most famous comics
characters are instantly recognizable, thanks to features that make them them
and not others. Superman's curl, Clark Kent's glasses, Tintin's trousers, and
Obelix's pigtails and belly all allow readers to identify immediately whom
they are looking at. These identifying features make us consider the
relationship between icon and caricature. The two terms appear to conflict,
as one removes specificity and identity (at least in McCloud's definition)
while the other confers them by metonymy (or perhaps synecdoche). We might
even say that this tension defines the visual representation of character in
comics. The featureless “icon” and the distinctly-marked “caricature” work
together hand in hand; otherwise, we can't tell Charlie Brown from Lucy or
Linus. The skill of the comic book artist is to find a balance between
caricature and iconicity that is both aesthetically satisfying and  conveys
character. And the demands of comic book drawing, the need to repeat the
image of a character over and over again play their part in this balance. If
a character's image changes too much from panel to panel, the artist runs the
risk of having the reader lose the identification of that character.

	Vaughn and Guerra's <em>Y the Last Man</em> and Hernandez' <em>Locas</em>
allow us to explore this tension. To my mind the representation of women in
<em>The Last Man</em> fits McCloud's definition of iconic representation as
absence of feature in comic book pictoral characterization, while the
representation of women in <em>Locas</em> fits the notion of balance between
iconicity and caricature that I am trying to draw out. Or rather, <em>The
Last Man</em> presents women “universally” as a set of norms and ideals while
<em>Locas</em> presents women “particularly” as discrete individuals.

	[caption id="attachment_1861" align="aligncenter" width="252"]<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Boobs.png"><img
class="size-medium wp-image-1861" title="Boobs"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Boobs-252x300.png"
alt="" width="252" height="300" /></a> (12)[/caption] <p style="text-align:
left;">Guerra's images of women as complete individuals are indistinct; they
could be anybody. Certain features identify each character, certainly, but
only minimally. And the identifying features are all facial. The bodies of
all the female characters are more or less indistinguishable. You could take
the head off of one and stick it on the body of another and you wouldn't be
able to tell the difference. This is not to say that Guerra's art is somehow
"bad." Rather, it follows the pattern of the corporate comics project.
Vertigo, which publishes Y, is an offshoot of DC, which in turn is a
subsidiary of Time Warner. Artists working for such companies presumably have
to satisfy executives, who in turn have to satisfy their reading public to
sell sufficient copies. The reading public of Vertigo comics has certain
"iconic" demands. The effect of all this is that the drawings in your average
corporate comic book have the same relationship to ordinary people as
Hollywood movie stars do.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">When Paul Chadwick
draws <em>Y the Last Man</em>, as he does for a couple of issues, the images
become more sexually iconic to the point of becoming Barbie-like. In his
first issue, a tension emerges between this iconicity and the substance of
the story, which revolves around a troupe of women actors. In a reversal of
the acting conditions of Shakespeare's time, all the actors are, of course,
women, and women have to take on men's roles. The women of the Nebraska town
they are currently visiting want a gender-stereotyped production: they want
the troupe to re-enact and update soap operas such as <em>The Days of Our
Lives</em>. The actors have no interest: they want to break these stereotypes
and much of their dialogue revolves around this subject. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Y-Feminist-Outcry.
png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1853" title="Y Feminist
Outcry"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Y-Feminist-Outcry-
184x300.png" alt="" width="184" height="300" /></a>But Chadwick's art totally
contradicts this dialogue: the actors wear bright red lipstick and cropped
tops that show off their breasts--the post-male world has had no effect on
the presentation of femininity to the masculine gaze, apparently. Even as the
characters strike out against gender stereotypes the way they are drawn
reasserts them. What gets me about the Chapman-drawn issues is their have
your cake and eat it too approach to gender representation. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Y-Dead-Men.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1854" title="Y Dead Men"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Y-Dead-Men-300x205.
png" alt="" width="300" height="205" /></a>It makes me want to turn to
<em>Danger Girl</em>, of which I'm a fan because of its unabashed, over the
top sexualization of its characters. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/
danger_girl_comic_image_01.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium
wp-image-1858" title="danger_girl_comic_image_01"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/
danger_girl_comic_image_01-228x300.jpeg" alt="" width="228" height="300"
/></a>I am reminded here of Slavoj Zizek's argument that the "Stalinist"
father is ethically superior to the "liberal" father because, ultimately, he
is "more honest."</p> <p style="text-align: left;">In his <em>Locas</em>
stories in <em>Love and Rockets</em>, Jaime Hernandez does something
different with the female form--indeed with all his characters--in order to
establish both identity and the evolution of that identity. He focuses mainly
on two women, Maggie Chascarillo and Hopey Glass, who assume shapes and
personalities of their own as the series progresses. In the world of
corporate comics, women like Maggie are few and far between if only because
of her body shape, which is an integral part of her character. As Maggie
struggles with depression and ages, her body shows the effects. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Locas-Maggie.png"><
img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1850" title="Locas Maggie"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Locas-Maggie-300x194.
png" alt="" width="300" height="194" /></a>This transformation has less to do
with "realism" than with particularity and specificity. Hernandez embodies
Maggie in his artwork, and that embodiment evolves over time. Hopey, Maggie's
on and off again lover, also evolves. She gets skinnier and more “butch” as
Maggie becomes more zaftig. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Locas-Hopey-and-
Maggie.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1851" title="Locas
Hopey and Maggie"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Locas-Hopey-and-
Maggie-300x188.png" alt="" width="300" height="188" /></a>By the end of
<em>Love and Rockets: New Stories #4</em>, two characters who started out
looking kind of similar have each attained a drawn character that has a
complex, yet discernible relationship to gender norms.  Furthermore, each is
iconic but not interchangeable. You and I might identify with Maggie and/or
Hopey because of the iconic elements of the Hernandez' art, but we wouldn't
confuse them with each other or with someone else because of his mastery of
caricature.</p> At the end of the day, <em>Y the Last Man</em> is a fine
comic in spite of issues I raise here, and Pia Guerra deserves her awards and
nominations. The story is engaging and intellectually challenging. But Jaime
Hernandez' <em>Locas</em> is something else, perhaps the zenith of the comics
form, because Hernandez produces characters who are "iconic" in a different
sense than the one McCloud uses. Maggie is "iconic" in the way she
establishes a template, not in the way she follows one.  With Fagin, Oliver
Twist, Pip, and Miss. Havisham, Charles Dickens created types. He brought
certain kinds of people into existence by distilling them, filling them up
rather than emptying them. With Maggie and Hopey, Jaime Hernandez does the
same.

prepare to have the fun sucked out of your favourite franchise.

	Ok, maybe not, but this is not a gushing, glowing review of <em>The Dark
Knight Rises</em>.  It is a deeply confused review of the film.  I will
endeavour not to include too much in the way of spoilers, but you might want
to wait to read this until you've seen the film, if only because I don't want
to impose my philosophical reading of the film on your experience of it.

	So, it's a movie about Occupy Wall Street, right?

	More specifically, it's a movie about rich white Hollywood's anxieties
about Occupy Wall Street, right?

	I'm not the first person to make this observation, but even without
having read the reviews discussing the parallels I found myself so distracted
by the ham-fisted use of Occupy imagery that I couldn't fall into the story
as I expected to.  The film shows us just how misunderstood the rich are;
they're usurious, sure, and they oppress and suppress without really knowing
that they're doing it.  But what we find out once they're overthrown is that
they were really saving us from ourselves all along.  Because poor people go
evil *fast*.  Like you've got no idea how many people poor people would
murder if they got half a chance.

	The villains of this picture have risen from poverty specifically to kick
ass, take names, and destroy World Order.  There is no framework in this
narrative where the world can be restructured from below and have a positive
outcome.

	Also, visually, let's represent felons as protestors -- let's conflate
those two worlds.  Also, when we let wrongly imprisoned people out of jail,
they're still evil.  Just in case you were wondering.

	The writers say <a
href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1690715/dark-knight-rises-occupy-wall-
street.jhtml">the connections weren't intentional</a> -- of course they
weren't.  That's how cultural anxieties get worked out on the screen.  That's
why Godzilla is really about nuclear war and King Kong is about cultural
others and Twilight is about anxieties relating to the power of feminism.
 <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> demonstrates just how deeply anxiety about
class warfare has permeated popular consciousness.

	Batman is about justice, whether justice aligns with the rule of law or
not.  Perhaps that's why I found it so frustrating to watch a retelling of
Batman's story that seems so careful to infer that, once empowered to act for
themselves, the collective 99% are a bunch of fucking morons.  And that only
Gotham's wealthy patron and caretaker -- even once brought low by the
selfish, thoughtless poor people -- can rescue the city and save the people.
 The benevolence of the elite.  They're just better than us.

	There are some beautiful performances in this film; Joseph Gordon Leavitt
and Anne Hathaway are tremendous additions to the franchise, and the film
ends on a letter-perfect note for fans of recent developments in the comics.
 The explosions are fantastic and the cinematography is exquisite.  But the
confused and problematic politics undermine the positive aspects of the film
to leave the end result muddled and unsatisfying.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I set out to write this
post about the web comic <a href="http://www.freakangels.com/?p=23"
target="_blank">Freak Angels</a>, by Warren Ellis and Paul Duffield. However,
just as I was about to dive headlong into its construction, Google decided to
celebrate the 107th anniversary publication of Windsor McKay’s <a
href="http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=
web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%
2FLittle_Nemo&amp;ei=Itp9UM3aFui0igLEiYCgDg&amp;usg=
AFQjCNEW0nSc3mcwWMm3kDpc1cYRebeVBQ&amp;sig2=YPkaXAGS8o0T7qGLcuvT5A"
target="_blank">Little Nemo in Slumberland</a>. They did so by placing <a
href="http://www.google.com/doodles/107th-anniversary-of-little-nemo-in-
slumberland" target="_blank">a “doodle”</a> on the Google homepage that
recontextualized McKay’s work within the Google moniker, a move they have
become famous for by changing their header to reflect all manner of
anniversaries, holidays and birthdays.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Doodle.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2073" title="Doodle"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Doodle-300x79.jpg"
alt="" width="300" height="79" /></a>

	Ellis and Duffield create a richly imagined post-apocolyptic steam-punk
London in Freak Angels. There’s nothing particularly original about the
story. It features a cast of characters with special powers—one of them being
telepathy—who have managed to carve out a collaborative society in the
post-apocolyptic version of a flooded London (specifically, Whitechapel).

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/freak_angels_01.jpg"
><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2074" title="freak_angels_01"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/freak_angels_01-
196x300.jpg" alt="" width="196" height="300" /></a>

	The main conflict arises from the pressure of external forces and from
conflicts within the community. In fact, I wasn’t all that engaged with Freak
Angels—it meanders a bit and there’s no consistent development—until I ran
into the Google homepage:

	<iframe src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fh3BdDTFSFo"
frameborder="0" width="640" height="360"></iframe>

	Google’s co-option of McKay’s work in order to make itself look clever
and heighten its brand awareness might challenge its “do no evil” slogan, but
it also got me thinking about how the web challenges the process of
encountering and reading comics. For one, Google no doubt brought a good deal
of attention to a significant comics innovator who has dropped out of the
spotlight a bit. Also, by animating McKay’s signature style, Google brought
McKay into line with the possibilities of html5. And, at the same time, the
doodle suggests the possibilities for re-imagining the comic in a new
presentational context (the Watchmen Motion Comic being another classic
example).

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/
little_nemo_elephant_1.jpg"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/
little_nemo_elephant_1-227x300.jpg" alt="" title="little_nemo_elephant_1"
width="227" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2088" /></a>

	The reason I responded to the McKay “doodle” was also tied to my
recognizing a rhyme between Duffield’s artwork in Freak Angels and McKay’s
meticulously crafted panels. The rhyme of course launched Google again as I
searched for images of McKay’s work on the web, found some and then moved on
to an <a
href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/little-nemo-in-slumberland/id489582566?
mt=8" target="_blank">iPad app</a> and a night of reading Windsor McKay
instead of Freak Angels.

	The point I’m labouring to come to is that web comics for the most part,
Freak Angels is no exception, merely transcribe the materiality of comics
onto the web. The web, it seems, is for most comic’s practitioners a place to
experiment with longer formats, to get out of their element and, in Ellis’
case, to get out of the economic and commodity restrictions that mark the
material world. What attracted me to the Google doodle was the way it
re-imagined, rather than transcribed the medium. Casting aside the obvious
issues of appropriation, etc., what Google’s doodle did, and I think this is
what distinguishes the web comic from its material version, was to send me to
other electronic versions of McKay’s work. Rather than turn me out toward the
printed version, as Freak Angels does consistently in the right-hand margins
of its web page, the Google doodle left me craving more re-animations,
re-imaginings, and re-contextualizations on the web.

	It might all come down to mapping. How should comics map themselves on
the web? Freak Angels unfolds in six “page” segments and offers a “visual
archive” of each volume, allowing a reader to see the different segments of
the comics.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/archive.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2075" title="archive"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/archive-300x209.jpg"
alt="" width="300" height="209" /></a> Freak Angels maps itself on the web in
a completely different way than we encounter it in the material world. It
strikes me that this might be the “pin” that web comics can drop: mapping the
archive of their process; the creative process, the publication process, the
narrative process. What Freak Angels and Google’s doodle do effectively is
archive the comic while at the same time creating spaces for re-imagining,
re-mixing, and re-encountering that archive.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think an excellent recent example of
"remapping" comics both semiotically and visually is xkcd's 1110 "Click and
Drag". Here the single panel is semiotically reordered to become a
multi-threaded narrative in its own right by technological remapping of the
panel space as exceeding the limits of the panel boundaries. Scott McCloud's
"infinite canvas" almost realised. What was fun, too, is that the
remapping/re-reading extended into interactive possibilities beyond the
click'n'drag journey through the panel space, as the comic was shared and
re-shared across Facebook and the like with the inevitable "Did you see the
---?"/"No, I missed that! Did you get to the ---?" conversation. And, as you
point out with the Google/McKay doodle, the mechanics of xkcd's click'n'drag
seemed a complimentary expression of the "signature style" of the static
panels.]]></wp:comment_content> <wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved>

Canadian Identity in a Webcomic World: Hark, A Vagrant</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Fellow Graphixian Peter
and I have been thinking a lot about the space for Canadian identity in the
world of comics as we put together our paper for Comics Forum 2012 on
<em>Scott Pilgrim</em>.  (I won't spoiler it in case you're going to be
there, but it involves Canadian identity.  And <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>.  How's
that for a teaser trailer?)  So with questions of national psyche weighing
heavily on my mind, I jumped at the chance to talk about Kate Beaton's
webcomic series <a href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/"><em>Hark, A
Vagrant</em></a> for our webcomics theme this month.  Because Kate Beaton is
awesome.  And Canadian.  And often discusses Canadian awesomeness.

	In prepping for Comics Forum 2012, I read a really interesting article by
Ryan Edwardson titled, “The Many Lives of Captain Canuck: Nationalism,
Culture, and the Creation of a Canadian Comic Book Superhero.”  In this
article, Edwardson discusses the psychological importance of seeing Canadian
identity represented in comics; in effect, he observes, comics remain “a
cultural arena where New York overwhelms New Brunswick, and one rarely sees a
maple leaf” (199).  You know how excited the Canadian newsmedia gets when <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkkXqNoXa8">Canada is going to be
featured on <em>The Simpsons</em></a> or <a
href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700006124/How-I-Met-Your-Mothers-
Canadian-jokes-are-all-in-good-fun.html?pg=all">the Canadian fan response
to <em>How I Met Your Mother</em></a> once Robin Sparkles was unleashed?
<blockquote>"I went to Canada, and that's all I heard," said Alyson Hannigan,
who stars as Lily.

	"Oh really?" Smulders said.

	"Yeah, but they were really happy about it," Hannigan said. "They were,
like, 'We love you guys making fun of us.' "

	In a weird way, maybe at least some Canadians appreciate that "How I Met
Your Mother" takes time to mock them.

	"It's almost like, 'Thanks for mentioning us!' " Smulders said. "People
tend to forget about us."</blockquote> Hurray for national low self-esteem!

	So when Canadian identity is discussed anywhere, but especially in any
space not exclusively dominated by Canadians (so not curling rinks or Tim
Hortons restaurants), we tend to take notice.

	Kate Beaton's <em>Hark, a Vagrant</em> comics are a unique blend of
engaging line art, historical and cultural subjects, and wry humour.  From a
perspective of Canadian identity, Beaton's work is particularly compelling in
that it places Canadian cultural references alongside major matters of global
history.  This juxtaposition allows for an equality of significance between
the two while simultaneously creating an in-group of Canadians who understand
the depth and range of references Beaton makes.  A certain amount of insider
information is required to make sense of many of the comics, thus creating an
on-line community of national identity in a space, the internet, that is
often conceived of as somehow post-national in scope.

	Take this Stan Rogers comic, for example:

	<img class="alignnone"
src="http://www.harkavagrant.com/history/stanpaper1.png" alt="" width="800"
height="568" />

	Stan Rogers was a folk singer originally from Ontario who made a career
writing and singing about Atlantic Canada primarily but also Canadian working
class history more generally.  This comic requires knowledge of a very
specific aspect of Eastern Canadian identity and national folk music culture
to really work.  Beaton doesn't footnote or frame this information; you
either get the gag, or you don't.  You're either part of the in-group for
this comic, or you're not.  What's significant about it is not merely its
existence, although that is noteworthy, but its placement: Beaton posted this
relatively obscure bit of Canadiana between comics on <a
href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=57">Mary Sidney</a> and <a
href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=59">St. Francis</a>, major
figures of importance to Western culture and history writ large.  Oh, Stan
Rogers, if only you could have predicted.

	Telling Canadian stories has a place and a worthiness that Beaton seeks
to explore.  Note, for example, her comic about Stompin' Tom Connors:

	<img class="alignnone"
src="http://www.harkavagrant.com/history/stompintomfinal.png" alt=""
width="800" height="638" />

	Beaton has Connors here asserting the legitimacy and necessity of a
national cultural project, and she does so while enacting her own at the same
time.

	Which is why she is totally bitchin', eh?

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have to admit, I’m
not a big reader of webcomics – my interest has always centred on comics as
material objects, collectible ephemera that I can organize alphabetically and
numerically, hoarding in my custom made shelves as a physical archive of the
shifting expression of cultural mores of Western society over the decades.
This isn’t to say that I don’t think that webcomics have value; if anything,
the opposite is true, as their content is not defined and limited by the
constraints of publishing giants and the distinctive styles that are
maintained by the Big Two. Success in webcomics is more based on advertising
on individual sites, making the evolution of webcomics truly based on the
merits of a singular author unrestrained by corporate values; as a result
(and as we’ve seen this month from our other Graphixians) readers receive
webcomics in which content defies conventional morality, language standards
and what could typically be considered “good taste” in experimental pursuit
of what consumers actually want to read. The level of experimentation also
often flaunts traditional copyright laws, allowing for very interesting
revisionings of other published works – my favorite of these has always been
“<a title="Garfield minus Garfield"
href="http://garfieldminusgarfield.net/">Garfield minus Garfield</a>,” a web
series that interestingly creates its content by removing content from
others’ work, problematizing the nature of authorship in fascinating ways.
Currently one of the most popular webcomics on the net, this series could not
have existed without its predecessor and interestingly has worked its way
from print to web and back into print.

	“Garfield” itself needs little introduction – written by Jim Davis, it
follows the adventures of a nerdy man named John Arbuckle and his always
hungry, always abusive and cynical cat. In reading “Garfield,” you need to
engage with the author’s suspension of reality and accept that Garfield is
responding to his owner through thought balloons, though it’s always a little
unclear as to whether or not Arbuckle can actually “hear” his counterpart. As
a daily serial in newspapers throughout the world and having been translated
into multiple languages, “Garfield” is one of comics’ greatest success
stories, second likely only to Schultz’s “Peanuts” in terms of popularity.
Having been published since 1978 and still running with no loss of
readership, Garfield holds the title of the world’s most syndicated comic.
Garfield has manifested in other media as well, having been a TV series,
videogame and several films, both live action and cartoon. In these different
versions however, the content has stayed the same.

	In Dan Walsh’s webcomic “Garfield minus Garfield,” however, the series
takes on entirely new meaning with its new online forum. Most fanfiction, web
or otherwise, works by adding new storylines to popular characters,
developing unnoticed plot threads and taking characters in new directions.
Walsh works fanfiction in the opposite direction, adding his perspective to
the series by <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GarfieldMain2.jpg"><
img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2105"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GarfieldMain2.jpg"
alt="" width="500" height="148" /></a>removing content from it. “Garfield
minus Garfield” operates exactly like the title would suggest: Walsh scans
and republishes Davis’ “Garfield” selected strips from the “Garfield” serial
after having photoshopped out the eponymous cat.

	What remains is interestingly a different serial altogether that is far
more tragic than it is comic – readers are left with Arbuckle having
conversations entirely with himself and often simply staring off with no
dialogue whatsoever. Instead of the funny, bitter banter between a man and
his cat that we’re accustomed to, we find a potentially schizophrenic man in
the midst of a constant existential crisis. Where Davis asks us to suspend
our reality, Walsh brings us back to it: this is the real, awkward world of
“Garfield,” consisting solely of a lonely man who has fictionalized sense of
self. The rest of the comic is unaltered in any way, with Davis’ signature
still on every strip that has migrated to Walsh’s page.<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GarfieldMain21.png">
<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2101"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GarfieldMain21.png"
alt="" width="500" height="146" /></a>

	This presents an interesting dilemma: who is really the author here? In
moving Garfield to the web, Walsh has changed the readership. In removing
Garfield, Walsh has dramatically changed the entire purpose and meaning of
the comic. What’s left remains entirely Davis’ work, though through omissions
and migration, this webcomic is a vastly altered serial that is certainly
Walsh’s own. It’s perhaps more found poetry than it is fan fiction, though
whose it actually “is” remains questionable.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GarfieldMinus1.png">
<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2102"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GarfieldMinus1.png"
alt="" width="500" height="143" /></a>Beyond the content, however, “Garfield
minus Garfield” has become so popular that it challenges our ideas of
publication as well. Davis himself has commented on Walsh’s work, admitting
that it’s an inspired revisioning of his original content and entirely unique
from his own story. Further, the print publisher of the collected Garfield
serials deemed “Garfield minus Garfield” so successful that it collected and
offered a popular print version of Walsh’s serial as well, though with Davis
noted as being the author and a simple foreword by Walsh. It’s as if
publishing can’t make up its mind as to whose work is really whose, and –
almost unfortunately - the relationship between Davis and Walsh is so
amicable that a line in the sand was not necessary to decide the issue.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GarfieldMinus6.jpg">
<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2104"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GarfieldMinus6.jpg"
alt="" width="500" height="148" /></a>From a broader perspective, “Garfield
minus Garfield” is arguably a better series than the original Garfield –
though it only carries any meaning whatsoever if one is familiar with Davis’
series. More importantly, because of the stringent nature of copyright, it
would never have come into existence if not for the casual freedom that web
publishing offers, and on the success of “Garfield minus Garfield,” further
variations have arisen including the open source, user contributed “<a
title="Square Root of Garfield Minus Garfield"
href="http://www.mezzacotta.net/garfield/">Square Root of minus Garfield</a>”
among others - one of the funniest and most compelling being "Garfield minus
Garfield plus a Cat," replacing Garfield with a simple, realistic,
unresponsive tabby. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/7-garfield-plus-
regular-tabby-cat.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2110"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/7-garfield-plus-
regular-tabby-cat.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="245" /></a> One could argue
that most webcomics operate on this fundamental principle: these are comics
that are often insistent on evolution through defying their originating print
versions, drawing careful attention to the affordances of the medium in terms
of both content and style. Whether this is manifest in reworking other
authors’ images, popularizing what would in print normally be considered
profane or exploding the traditional frame through what Scott McCloud calls
the “infinite canvas” (a description of which <a title="is right here"
href="http://scottmccloud.com/4-inventions/canvas/index.html">is right
here</a> and worth reading), the current webcomics industry is populated by
authors seeking to truly “make it new” and define themselves
against-while-through the standards set by their forebears. Where success in
the print medium of comics typically means getting hired by the big two and
playing by their often formulaic rules, the generally self publishing world
of webcomics demands a heightened sense of individual expression and
experimentation, and if there is to be a further literary turn in comics, the
web is likely where we’ll find it.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Graphixia</em>
has come some distance since Peter and Dave began fooling around with a
shared-writing project on Google Docs and Dropbox. We are approaching our
100th post and have no intention of slowing down. </p>

	<p>Over the next three weeks, <em>Graphixia</em> will be adding a new
dimension as we present two collaborative papers in two international
conferences. Peter and Brenna will be presenting a paper entitled “An
Innocent at Home: Scott Pilgrim and His Canadian Multicultural Contexts” at
<em><a href="http://comicsforum.org/comics-forum-2012/"
target="_blank">Comics Forum 2012</a></em> in Leeds, England on November 16.
<em>Comics Forum</em> is associated with <em><a
href="http://thoughtbubblefestival.com/" target="_blank">Thought
Bubble</a></em> a renowned festival of sequential art whose guests this year
include Kate Beaton, Mark Waid, and Alison Bechdel. In addition to presenters
from the UK, the conference will feature scholars from the United States,
Canada, Romania, and Norway, to name a few countries. </p>

	<p>The following week, on November 21, Peter and David will present a
multi-media project entitled “<a href="http://www.thedclab.org/dominioncity/"
target="_blank">Mapping Seth: Dominion City as Heritage District</a>” at the
<em>International Conference on the Preservation of Heritage Districts</em>
at Beijing Union University. This conference will be something special, as we
will be talking about comics in China before an audience of architects and
heritage preservationists. </p>

	<p>From its inception, <em>Graphixia</em> has been based on collaborative
writing and a shared sense of building a new kind of academic discourse,
focusing on comics but also exploring new platforms and modes of working that
the 21st century affords. Consequently, our participation in these
conferences represents a triumph of our approach for us, as we have
transformed a “hobby” into a going academic concern. Our plan is to venture
into larger scholarly publishing projects that will make <em>Graphixia</em> a
centre for the academic discussion of comics in Canada. </p>

	<p>Peter and Brenna will be video-blogging the <em>Comics Forum</em>
conference from Leeds and Peter and David will do their best to do the same
from Beijing, depending on internet restrictions. We hope to give you as much
a sense of being there as possible, to see and hear how our presentations fit
into the larger contexts of the conferences. </p>

	<p>Speaking of video-blogging, this week marks our first use of Google
Hangouts to record <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waBZUzH21ms"

The International Symposium on The Preservation and Renewal of Heritage
Districts, Beijing China Nov. 20, 2012 </strong> <strong>Introduction: Two
Dominions</strong>

	The work of Canadian comic book artist Seth raises theoretical questions
about the nature of a heritage district. Beginning with a nostalgia for lost
buildings and businesses in his early work, Seth ultimately creates a
fictional 1950s Canadian town, Dominion City. We apply web tools to the comic
book form to create a layered and interactive map of this imaginary place.
This process has allowed us to reflect on the relationships between
permanence and ephemerality, space and time, matter and spirit in heritage
districts. When Seth builds Dominion out of cardboard, producing a fixed,
material version of his world, he forsakes what makes the comics work:
narrative. The cardboard version of Dominion ends up being an empty shell,
disconnected from any particular story that would connect it to the past.
This empty quality plagues all heritage districts that privilege permanence,
space, and matter over transformation, temporality, and ephemera.

	Taking as our starting point an interrogation of the comics grid that
structures the narratives of the medium, we argue that comics provide an
ideal structure for the multiple iterations of urban spaces, animating
essentially dead spaces that signify, rather than possess, heritage value.
The structure of the comics page creates a relationship between space (the
panels and drawings) and time (the sequence of those panels and drawings)
that allows it to combine stasis and progress. Furthermore, this progress
depends entirely on the viewer’s engagement to make it work. The viewer makes
the grid function, animating the material it contains in a way that
transcends the ephemerality and disposability of the comic book itself. This
active construction of temporal layers of meaning out of static, yet
ephemeral form allows us to imagine an interactive web space that treats
Seth’s fictional heritage district like a real one to explore how it has
similar creative concerns and pitfalls.

	Seth’s depiction of Dominion in both a two-dimensional comic book version
and three-dimensional cardboard model allows us to investigate the contrast
between the two representations. Where Seth’s cardboard Dominion reveals
anxiety over our inability to preserve the urban environment in an ideal
moment, against the rush of time, the comic book version of Dominion, and our
web project’s appropriation of it, maps time onto space, allowing a
continuity between past and present. Our web project takes the panels
distributed across space and stacks them in layers so that the viewer can
move through Dominion City and interact with how it changes over time,
creating new narratives by manipulating the layers rather than merely
observing an intact preservation. As a mode of “digital archaeology,” our
project provides a method for allowing what architect Michael McClelland
calls the “ghost functions” of urban spaces to circulate in the present.

	<strong>Background: Comics and Buildings in It’s a Good Life if You Don’t
Weaken </strong> The first few issues of Seth’s serialized comic book
Palookaville, which he started in 1991, present autobiographical stories of
his youth. In issue #4 he begins a story arc, It’s a Good Life if You Don’t
Weaken, that establishes his prominence as a graphic storyteller. It’s a Good
Life also establishes urban and architectural heritage as a central theme in
Seth’s work. Subsequently, narratives about characters as historians on
quests for the recovery of something lost dominate his work. These characters
attempt to sort out and represent the lost, intricate connections between the
past and the present. In particular, the narrator or protagonist is often
spurred by encounters with urban spaces or architecture. Early in It’s a Good
Life, a fictional autobiography about a quest for a little known cartoonist,
the narrator comes across an abandoned paint shop (Fig.1). <p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/fig_01_pv_05_14.jpg"
><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2133" title="fig_01_pv_05_14"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/fig_01_pv_05_14.jpg"
alt="" width="553" height="285" /></a></p> As he glances through the window,
the narrative shifts from the degradation of the shop’s architectural details
to a personal narrative about how he inherited “a sad sort of love” for
particular comic strips “because they were passed on to me by my parents.
‘Nancy’ and ‘Andy Capp’ from my mother, ‘Little Nipper’ from my dad. These
are the strips they enjoyed” (PV #5 14). For Seth, heritage means having the
details, or ephemera—like “wood shelves, tile floors, tin ceilings”—connect
us with our own personal histories, thereby preserving not just the substance
but the spirit of the past. What makes Seth’s representation of heritage
unique is that comics are themselves bound up in the preservation of these
details in an ephemeral form.

	In the instance of the paint shop, Seth does not draw the interior
architectural details so we feel their absence. The cartoon exterior of the
shop acts as a kind of placeholder for them. If we can see them in our mind’s
eye, triggered by the depiction of the exterior, then the transmission works.
Otherwise, we hit the end of the line: everything the paint shop represents
about the past dies. The exterior of the paint shop is a mnemonic trigger
that calls forth memories of both an inherited taste in comics and the value
of ephemeral architectural details for which this comic book image may be the
only repository.

	Seth implies that comics can convey architectural heritage in the absence
of the building itself. Cartoon representation provides a stripped down image
that functions in two registers: that of the icon—the general outline of
something that empties it of specifics and makes it easier to draw and
reproduce—and that of caricature—the selection of recognizable details that
allow viewers to quickly identify things and people. These iconic caricatures
function associatively: from their details, we identify what they represent
and imaginatively flesh them out; they are associative triggers that function
like maps. “Actual” heritage districts tend to work in a similar way. We
preserve identifying features of buildings and streets as we adapt them to
the modern world. We look to see how the edifice triggers associations with
past manifestations, intermingles with its immediate environment, and
suggests the people who once inhabited it. Because buildings and urban spaces
are subject to time and their use value to people’s evolving needs, tastes,
and economic circumstances, preserving them in any authentic form is
impossible. The only alternative is to create an archive of associative
mnemonic triggers, for which the comic book, and the creative process that
informs it, can be a model.

	<strong>Comics: Ephemera and Permanence/ Archives and Architecture
</strong> The link between comics, historical archives, and architecture is
common in the discussion of comic book form. The comics page is an
architectural grid of compartments that holds text and images (Fig. 2). <p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/fig_02_pv_19_90_02.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2127" title="fig_02_pv_19_90_02"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/fig_02_pv_19_90_02-
1024x255.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="153" /></a></p> The reader can
approach the grid from a variety of perspectives and starting positions,
which in turn generate a number of different lines of interpretation and
layers of perception. As Chris Ware says, “[One way to look at comics] is to
pull back and consider the composition all at once, as you would the façade
of a building. You can look at a comic as you would look at a structure that
you could turn around in your mind and see all sides of at once” (Raeburn
25). In short, the comics grid is, as Ware argues, as much like a building in
its structure as it is like a page of conventional prose. But whereas
buildings have some permanence, comics are ephemeral by nature. Historically
the comic book has been produced on cheap paper to be read quickly and
discarded. Jared Gardner argues that comic book artists use the ephemerality
of the form ironically, to archive ephemerality in general: “[comics] are
archives in the loosest, messiest sense of the word—archives of the forgotten
artifacts and ephemera of American popular culture” (788). ￼Astute comic book
artists like Seth, Chris Ware,1 and Art Spiegelman2 have used comics as way
to archive decaying or lost buildings: the ephemeral comic persists as the
record of the supposedly permanent building. These artists invert the
conventional relationship between ephemerality and permanence to make the
point that even the most permanent of human constructions is ultimately
ephemeral (Fig. 3). <p style="text-align: center;"><a

/></a></p> <strong>Clyde Fans</strong>

	Dominion City first appears in Clyde Fans, a serialized story about a
family business that produces electric fans. It appears in Palookaville
immediately following It’s a Good Life if You Don’t Weaken. One of the
story’s main characters, Simon Matchcard, exhibits the conflict between the
fantasy of a past that can be substantially preserved versus the reality that
it is ephemeral. For instance, Simon identifies himself with the physical
structure of the apartment where he looked after his mother, imagining that
it represents a material, permanent manifestation of his psyche. Furthermore,
when he visits Dominion City on a failed sales trip, he fixes it in his mind
as frozen in an ideal state, a changeless “eternal city” that again acts as a
kind of defense against time and death.

	But when Simon returns to Dominion in a dream, we see the nightmarish
aspect of this fantasy: the city he encounters is “stilled,” and empty. He
remembers the buildings; it all looks “Big as life” (PV #19 72) but bereft of
narrative, it is not Dominion City at all (Fig. 4). <p style="text-align:
center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/fig_04_pv_19_72.jpg"
><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2135" title="fig_04_pv_19_72"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/fig_04_pv_19_72-
1024x773.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="464" /></a></p> In order to cope,
Simon immediately identifies the city in the dream with one he has seen in
his collection of postcards, which he has a hobby of collecting and
archiving. ￼This activity echoes the archival function of the comic book
itself, as it is a way of giving meaning and value to what would otherwise be
valueless. But while the comic book opens up what it archives to its
audience, Simon’s collection of postcards is private and closed. It asserts
his authority and control over material from the past.

	Thus, Simon’s archive of postcards represents the negative image of our
web project. He archives not to share but to keep, control, and protect his
psychic space. His collection functions like the apartment he shares with his
mother as a fortress against time, decay, and, ultimately, other people.
While he says, "Dominion...That name has a deep power over me. I can still
feel that thread pulling between me and its places....The streets, the
shops...the Bluebird Restaurant....I can still feel them sitting out
there—unchanged, unmoved. Frozen" (PV #16 15), he still has power over it
(Fig. 5). <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/fig_05_pv_16_15_02.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2128" title="fig_05_pv_16_15_02"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/fig_05_pv_16_15_02.
jpg" alt="" width="557" height="279" /></a></p> We speculate that this moment
is when Seth starts to imagine a three-dimensional cardboard version of
Dominion as a way of preserving his imaginary city, giving it some material,
substantive support. Simon Matchcard visits Dominion in 1957, towards the end
of Seth's ideal Canadian decade. In Clyde Fans, which Seth has yet to
complete, this idealization of Dominion appears ironic, associated with
Simon’s delusional fantasy. But Seth’s work more and more identifies with
this position and consequently his vision of Canadian heritage becomes more
private and frozen and less engaged with the continuity between past, present
and future. ￼

	<strong>George Sprott</strong>

	Dominion City is the setting for George Sprott, a story, which first
appeared in The New York Times Magazine as Seth was on hiatus from Clyde Fans
and Palookaville. In this story, the imaginary city in fact contends with the
title character for central focus. Three episodes tell the histories of
buildings in Dominion, and show Seth using the lateral space of the comics
grid to hold various phases of the building’s narrative. Our website converts
what is laid out laterally and sequentially on the page into layers, with the
present landscape on the top and a succession of “epochs” beneath it. Such
cataloguing allows for alternative ways through the “lifespan” of a
neighbourhood or architectural space according to the interests of the user.
The virtual layering plays with the physical law that two objects cannot
occupy the same space simultaneously. Consequently, the user can navigate
through the layers of meaning and produce new narrative paths. The website
asks the user to resist freezing the past in a particular moment by provoking
numerous journeys across and through Dominion City in conjunction with Seth’s
narrative about it. With a certain amount of irony, we take Seth’s
“old-fashioned” notion that an archive necessarily collects things of the
past and transposes them onto a paper grid--a spreadsheet, say, with boxes of
verbal and visual information--and tweak it with contemporary technology to
re-map it in a less despairing way. While Seth’s mode of representation
always has a horizon of destruction, so that a building or neighborhood has a
lifespan like a human being’s that ends in death, our tweaked comic book map
sustains the past in the present and projects it into the future.

	Seth’s history of the The Melody Grill, George’s favourite restaurant,
exemplifies this layering of a building’s story. Located “in the once-grand
neighborhood of Lakeside—now a run-down commercial strip” (24), The Melody
Grill began its existence in 1933 as Der Hirschsprung, a German restaurant
(Fig. 6). But the arrival of the Second World War caused the owner to forsake
that origin so as not to alienate patriotic Canadians. The transformation
proves profitable as the Melody Grill becomes a successful local hotspot and
remains one through the 1950s (Fig. 7).

jpg" alt="" width="549" height="277" /></a>

	As the stars who frequent the place grow old and fade away, so does the
Melody Grill: “Restaurants, too, have life spans. They die young or age
gracefully or sink into neglect and decline” (24). However, to freeze the
Melody Grill at the moment of its success in the name of preservation is
ahistorical and dishonest; we need all the phases of a building’s life to
appreciate its heritage. The Melody Grill has a third iteration as an
inexpensive place where “local merchants, day laborers and tradesmen” go for
lunch (24). Each of these three stages could represent its heritage value:
its German origin, its heyday, and its destiny as a cheap local diner.
Choosing one over the others to represent its true heritage value would be a
matter of ideology and subjectivity. The comics grid offers is a way of
mapping time onto space that preserves all three moments. As the narrative
sequence moves through time, the images show the distinct phases of the
building. The gutters, or spaces between the panels, allow us to disassemble
the linear temporality of the normal reading sequence to rearrange the page
as we look at it. Seth’s page takes the layers of history and distributes
them across the grid so we can appreciate each one. This ability to scan the
compartments of the page and move back and forth among them is important
because it allows the viewer to see other relations besides strict temporal
sequence. For example we can put the “cheap lunch” version of the Melody
Grill next to the Der Hirschsprung version to see if we can find cultural
connections between the restaurant’s German origin and its current function
in the neighborhood. We can see how the different iterations of the space
relate to each other. Like a road map, a comics page shows many routes and
many possible destinations, each of which will have its own associations and
connections. The amalgamation and archiving of these associations and
connections creates a more complete and engaging picture of heritage than any
particular iteration of a space frozen in time.

	Seth provides similar layers of history for The Radio Hotel and The
Coronet Lecture Hall. In 1925 when it opened, the Radio was meant to be
“ultra-modern—futuristic even” but “just 10 years later the name was terribly
out of date. By the ’70s...it sounded positively prehistoric” (34). When the
hotel joins the Marriott Chain, it loses its name and any specificity. The
Coronet Lecture Hall, “Built in 1884 by local entrepreneur Thomas Lilley” is
highly regarded as “Horn’s Vintage Halls of Canada (1993 edition) noted,
‘while in poor repair, it is still a magnificent building’” (43). But once
its days as a lecture hall are done, the Coronet undergoes various iterations
as blues hall, strip club and finally a dollar store. A “discount
computer-sales outlet” replaces it, after it meets the wrecking ball. Seth’s
problem with buildings in Canada is that they follow a trajectory of economic
entropy. Unique and storied spaces devolve into banality governed by cash
value. Seth sees the dollar store, the discount outlet, and the chain hotel
as the nadir of this process.

	<p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/fig_08_sprott_17_03.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2131" title="Unknown"

1024x222.jpg" alt="" width="747" height="162" /></a></p>

	Ultimately, this entropic movement of urban history undoes Seth’s
attempts to hold onto the past in the comics grid. So, while Seth gives us
the tools to map the pasts of buildings and districts, his fatalism about the
present and the future prevents him from using those tools to tell anything
but a sad tale (Fig. 8).

	<strong>Dominion City</strong>

	This fatalism about the destiny of urban space leads Seth to exchange
temporality for space and matter when he creates the cardboard version of
Dominion, apparently giving up on narrative altogether. In an interview with
Kathleen Dunley in The Comics Grid, Seth says, “I have a feeling that if it’s
not the next book, it’s coming soon, where it’s just going to be a book about
Dominion and have no plot whatsoever” (Comics Grid). Once he moves out of the
realm of narrative, Seth loses the multiple iterations of space and freezes
Dominion in his ideal 1950s form: <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/fig_09_dominion_01.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2132" title="fig_09_dominion_01"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/fig_09_dominion_01-
1024x751.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="451" /></a></p> Seth tells how he
came to construct Dominion out of cardboard in Palookaville #20. He imagined
using Dominion as the setting for five cartoon short stories, and began
sketching and describing buildings of the town a ledger book: “But where do
you start when dreaming up an entire city? That’s a big task. The easiest
answer seemed to be to begin with a single building” (PV #20 42). The
model-making at first seemed a diversion that allowed Seth to meditate on the
buildings while constructing them so that he would be better able to imagine
stories to go with them. But the stories never materialized.

	Making the buildings instead of drawing them in a sequence of panels
turns Dominion into a much more private space, over which Seth exercises
godlike control: “Dominion turned out to be an idealized place. A
quintessentially small Canadian city—old and faded—in decline even—but
idealized in that it contained nothing that I didn’t desire to be there” (PV
#20 42). Dominion allows him the opportunity to counteract the destruction of
buildings and businesses that he documents in his other work: “I was
collecting buildings—putting them in amber—saving them from the wrecking
ball” (PV #20 44). Because Seth is working with a private world of his own
creation, not operating in the real world, he can do what he likes. The
problem for the actual preservationist who tries to wrest spatial permanence
out of temporal flow is that he or she is working in the real world. When we
look at the Melody Grill in the cardboard construction of Dominion, we wonder
what happened to all the other stories, the other occupations of that space,
that putting this version in amber has erased. It is worth noting that
putting something in amber to protect it also makes it unusable.

	With his cardboard constructions Seth shows the subjective dimension of
what counts as important for heritage. But the heritage of actual urban
spaces is intersubjective in its meaning. We can’t say that they contain
nothing that we don’t want to be there. This intersubjectivity reintroduces
the temporal element. Your story and my story and that of everybody else who
has passed through this place counts, and those stories are not frozen in
time. The true heritage site is collaborative, not private.

	Our web model of Dominion shows the potential to collect the memories and
fantasies of the people who have something invested in urban buildings and
spaces. Rather than putting one iteration of a space in amber—effectively
killing it to preserve it—our comic book virtual archaeology allows for many
iterations and narratives. In this model, the buildings in a space would be
less important than these iterations and narratives. To use the case of the
Melody Grill, someone would say, “I remember it as a German restaurant” while
someone else would say, “I remember it as a socialite hotspot.” And a third
person would say it was a just a place in the neighborhood where workers
could get a cheap lunch. These contested versions of the space would give it
meaning, and the map would allow us to see these different layers without
necessarily privileging any of them.

	Although we critique Seth’s cardboard buildings, his impulse for building
them reflects a powerful urge for anyone invested in heritage preservation:
the desire for a material mnemonic trigger, something that one can see and
touch rather than just read or hear about. For Seth, the materiality of this
trigger is more important than accuracy. He writes that the buildings “are
not to any scale, and the scale between buildings varies wildly” (PV #20 54).
But, in spite of the models’ imaginariness and inconsistency, they invoke the
metaphorical exchange of matter for spirit: “Somehow the homey materials
manage to transmit some of the qualities of age and neglect that I find so
appealing out in the real urban landscape” (PV #20 54). “Homey materials” is
a curious expression because it means familiar, close to home: heimlich, as
the Germans would say. But, as Freud argues, the heimlich and the unheimlich,
or uncanny, are closely linked. And the cardboard buildings trigger the
uncanny moment, as buildings from an imaginary town no one has ever seen or
been to assume the status of heritage site. This uncanny feeling is perhaps
what we seek from heritage sites: we want that which we feel ought to be
familiar but in fact is long dead to return to life amid the modern city.
Consider the way Michael McClelland talks about the revived heritage
Distillery District in Toronto:

	<blockquote>It is the heritage buildings which bring a sense of
otherness—in their texture, smell and feel. The original purposefulness of
the malt houses, cooperages and fermenting cellars has faded into a
palimpsest of ghost functions lying beneath the current operations of the
site. (24)</blockquote>

	The problem of the heritage site is a quasi-religious one: people fear
they require a material connection to the “ghost functions” of the past, or
they will disappear and we will lose our uncanny connection with them.

	While some would argue that we need to preserve the authentic buildings
and spaces of the past itself in order to have a genuine heritage experience,
we argue the opposite. The more we neglect the temporal dimension of heritage
to focus on materiality in space the less likely the ghost functions of the
past are to appear. Instead of the dynamic, layered narrative of the comic
book, we get the cardboard shell “preserved in amber.” By manipulating Seth’s
comics through fairly simple web modeling, we hope to show a way of engaging
with the ghost functions of the past through imaginative endeavour that
allows them to circulate in the present, a way in which the ever-transforming
digital archive of ephemera replaces the fixed materiality of building or
urban space as the key to heritage preservation.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <center>[youtube_video
id="QJbaJ9gePMc"]</center>

	Peter Wilkins and I had the most marvellous time at Comics Forum 2012
this year.  I've put together a videoblog of some interviews and chats we had
in and around the Central Library in Leeds.  I think the video makes it clear
what a fun, engaging, thoughtful, and compelling conference it was.  It also
probably makes it clear that I am not that awesome at video editing.  Some
things that may not come clear from the video: <div> <ul> <li>I took a bunch
of video of panels but the sound was unusable.  If I videoed your panel and
chatted with you about it but it's not here, it's not for any reason other
than that I am kind of a terrible camera person.</li> <li>Simon Grennan is,
without fear of exaggeration, the most dapper human being who is not in a
Bond movie.</li> <li>Hattie Kennedy is a delight and might be my academic
soul sister.  And we have the same favourite Anne of Green Gables novel
(House of Dreams, obviously).</li> <li>It doesn't take much to get me to hold
court about the deep and lasting intellectual impact of Fraggle Rock.</li>
<li>The organizers of Comics Forum 2012, Ian Hague and Carolene Ayaka, are
amazing and they really worked hard to put together a hell of a conference.
 The volunteers who kept the lights on were also universally helpful and
kind.</li> <li>I have no video clip of linguist Frank Bramlett of the
University of Nebraska, and I have no idea why not.  I declared him my
Favourite Person of the Conference.  You can check out his edited collection,
<em>Linguistics and the Study of Comics</em> (2012), to see his levels of
awesome.</li> <li>Every conference should have an award for Best Canadian
Paper, and Peter Wilkins and I should win it.</li> </ul> <div>Thanks to Peter
for doing all the talking and letting me remain comfortably behind the
camera.  And if I'm not at Comics Forum 2013, I will totally want to punch
myself in the face.</div> </div>]]></content:encoded>

we’re recognizing comics from outside of North America – highly appropriate,
given that three of our number have just completed a whistlestop world tour
bringing Canadian content abroad through the graphic narrative conference
circuit. As it’s also Remembrance month, I wanted to turn to Jacques Tardi’s
<em>C’etait la Guerre des Tranchees</em>, originally published over a twelve
year span in <em>A Suivre</em> and <em>Le Trous d’Obus</em> in France, which
thankfully has been translated for a North American audience by Fantagraphics
Books as <em>It was the War of the Trenches</em>. This haunting, often
disturbing exploration of the first World War based on primary source texts,
personal family narratives and photorealistic translations of violent images
and the scenery of the war is entirely delivered from the French perspective
– a take on the war that history students in the West are often quite
ignorant of, having been inundated with the dominant accounts propagated by
its own national rhetoric. Seeing Tardi’s portrayal of the horrors of trench
warfare and his vision of the random senselessness and brutality that
accompanies it reminds us to reflect on our (mis)conceptions of history,
drawing attention to the fractal realities that are embedded in events that
have been experienced internationally.

	<a

class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2167"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/grave1.jpg" alt=""
width="770" height="357" /></a>A meticulous, detailed and factual reading of
WWI, <em>War of the Trenches</em> is based on recounting research conducted
on primary accounts of the war from soldiers’ perspectives, which are
frequently unsettling because of how banal they are – Tardi presents war as a
state of confusion, a fact that he displays in his visceral imagery of
aimless soldiers, often left alone in a state of permanent but curiously
mundane existential crisis. Oscillating between devastated landscapes and
close-ups of soldiers faces, these images have largely been transcribed from
photographic representations of those who actually fought in the war
(compiled by his archivist Jean-Pierre Verney), adding an emotional depth
through a layer of affect that highlights the strengths of the medium and
which simple textual retellings of the war cannot help but fail to achieve.
Tardi emphasizes this by eschewing the traditional, nationalized approach to
WWI literature, showcasing the hesitant, unconvinced nature of the troops –
vignettes of soldiers shot by their own side for desertion and refusal to
follow orders, and those marched knowingly to their deaths because of
disaffected, shell-shocked leadership dominate the text. In this sense,
<em>War of the Trenches</em> borders on the seditious, intent on defying any
attempts to present the war as rational or moral.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/amputees1.jpg"><img
class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2169"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/amputees1.jpg" alt=""
width="342" height="160" /></a>Tardi defies traditional narrative structure
as well, avoiding protagonists that would allow you a character to root for;
in his own words, <em>War of the Trenches</em> is “a non-chronological
sequence of situations, lived by men who have been jerked around and dragged
through the mud … There are no ‘heroes,’ there is no ‘protagonist’ in this
awful collective ‘adventure’ that is war. Nothing but a gigantic, anonymous
scream of agony.” (i). There is little dialogue to the story, as Tardi is
most often outside looking in on these events, narrating while visually
depicting the atrocities that occurred in the trenches. He also brings to
light the nationalist fervor in Paris that accompanied the onset of war, with
an elderly abstainer, refusing to be caught up in the revelry, beaten to
death by a mob of citizens for presumably being a spy or a traitor. Similar
scenes of violence abound in the text, most notably when a squad of Germans
uses Belgian women and children as shields, and whom the French soldiers
shoot down anyways.

	The graphic novel takes on a highly personal tone at the midpoint of the
text as the reader is offered the stories told by Tardi’s grandfather,
himself a participant in the war. Shifting to a first person account and
pulling no punches, Tardi introduces this section by describing his
grandfather’s experience of sleeping in a trench in what he thought was mud,
his hands actually having been buried in the entrails of a fallen soldier.
Meant to shock and disgust, graphic narrative here provides a means of
allowing the reader an entrypoint into the war that is otherwise attainable
only through film – implicit in Tardi’s work is how much more effective
accounts of genocide are if accomplished through a medium that m<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/skull.jpg"><img
class="wp-image-2158 alignright"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/skull.jpg" alt=""
width="332" height="481" /></a>arries primary, textual accounts with
similarly primary visual representations. Here, there is no glamour or
nationalism in his approach, and it’s appropriate that Tardi recounts
underused stories of confusion and chaos through the similarly underused
graphic narrative for the relating of historical documents; both form and
content assert themselves with an insistence that is seemingly self-conscious
throughout the novel. Even though this is a text based on translation of
these events to the page, it feels far closer to reality than the
propagandized historical materials offered by the typical academic publishing
industry and so many ministries and agencies that have long become entrenched
in our collective national psyche – more real, even, than purely textual
autobiographical accounts.

	The visual, in historical documents, brings the reader closer to what
Raymond Williams notes as the “structure of feeling,” being the ultimately
unattainable cultural experience of a particular moment in history, with all
of the emotional context that attends it. It is in the blank stares and
confused expressions of the real French soldiers and citizens whom Tardi
portrays that we see a reflection of what this unimaginable loss of human
life can do to the spirit, as we’re shown limbless bodies and rotten corpses
as casually as the soldiers themselves were exposed to in the trenches. There
is a level of authenticity to the text that is simultaneously illuminating
and, frankly, alarming. Tardi writes that “the only thing that interests me
is man and his suffering, and it fills me with rage” (i) – this rage is
perfectly and terrifyingly transcribed in <em>It was the War of the
Trenche</em>s, adding depth and urgency to our worn out aphorism “Lest we
Forget.”

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of my aims for my
latest trip to the UK was to pick up a copy of Oliver East’s <em>Trains
Are…Mint</em>, which came out in 2008. I thought I would pick it up from
Gosh! Comics in London on my way to China to talk about Seth (I get a kick
out of writing sentences that make me sound like a habitual globetrotter).
But I didn’t have to wait that long because Oliver had a table at <em>Thought
Bubble</em> in Leeds when I visited the convention on November 17.

	Oliver kindly signed my copy and made me a drawing. I had to leave his
table and come back because his pencil kept breaking. It was funny at the
time, but it became funnier when I read <em>Trains</em> because his pens keep
running out in the book. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Dedication.jpeg"><
img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2174" title="Dedication"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Dedication-663x1024.
jpeg" alt="" width="663" height="1024" /></a> My first reading of
<em>Trains</em> gave rise to a question that I normally find tiresome: is
this comics? <em>Trains</em> poses this question in a good way. While every
now and then a grid structures the page, as often as not each page is a
single image with notes. Labels on tins, signs in windows, and graffiti
function slyly as text boxes. And the colours are as nice as anything in
Brecht Evans’ work. Nevertheless, as you look at <em>Trains</em>, you can’t
help thinking “this is miles away from Spider-Man.” But it’s also miles away
from Chris Ware and Jaime Hernandez. So what is <em>Trains Are…Mint</em>?

	The conceit of the book is Oliver walking from Manchester to Blackpool,
taking pictures and writing notes. The book reports on the journey as a
low-key, quotidian travelogue; at the end of each day he goes home again,
starting the next morning where he left off. East never rationalizes his
project. He doesn’t explain what he’s doing or why he’s doing it. The book
simply begins with the opening stages of the walk. At times it looks like he
is collecting graffiti, at others like he is reflecting on train stations.

	The mystery surrounding the motivation of <em>Trains</em> makes the book
work, as do the glimpses of Oliver’s life outside of walking: his job and his
relationships all appear fleetingly, gestures towards an autobiographical
comic that could be but isn’t. We wonder how all this wandering, map work,
and observation connects to that life. What sort of allegory is this? What’s
being repressed? We know he has a partner, a child, a job that has something
to do with a club. We know that he likes football. But we acquire this
knowledge almost by accident, as East focuses our attention on train stations
and landscapes.

	The predominant mood of the images is one of solitude. East’s isolation
as he wanders the train tracks is palpable and sometimes unsettling, like
Carey Grant in the middle of a cornfield in Hitchcock’s <em>North by
Northwest</em>. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/mint-005.jpeg"><img
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2187" title="mint 005"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/mint-005-679x1024.
jpeg" alt="" width="679" height="1024" /></a>The real focus is the walking,
the journey, the destination, and how to get back. Whenever Oliver goes off
map, there’s the danger of getting lost, losing the thread, coming off track.
What does it mean to get lost in the 21st Century landscape of northern
England? Is it possible to be alone in such a place?

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/mint-003.jpeg"><img
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2181" title="mint 003"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/mint-003-703x1024.
jpeg" alt="" width="703" height="1024" /></a>

	In fact, the spaces East depicts are curiously empty, and whenever other
people appear in <em>Trains Are…Mint</em> anxiety ensues because they
introduce potential conflict as they interrupt the solitary walk. For
instance, when we see people for the first time, the potential for violence
looms: “I walk past a man shouting at the men re-laying the road and carry on
past the Roman fort” (13). Solitary paths hold the potential for threat:
“Short stubby bushes look like rapists. Big, bushy bushes look like murder
domes” (51). And “Old ladies and their dogs look menacing in the early
morning” (30). Nothing bad ever happens except in East’s imagination. He
daydreams about stumbling on the dead body of a girl, for instance. And on
one rather startling page, East himself becomes the imaginary threatening
figure to a woman out for a run. These are the moments that charge up
<em>Trains Are…Mint</em>

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/mint-002.jpeg"><img
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2184" title="mint 002"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/mint-002-1024x613.
jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="613" /></a>

	Paul Gravett’s blurb on the cover claims for <em>Trains</em> a curious
literary allegience: “<em>On the Road Becomes On the Tracks</em>.” But that
equation is somewhat misleading. For one thing, there are more actual trains
in <em>On the Road</em>, and, for another, there is no “burn, burn, burn”
energy in <em>Trains</em>, nor any of the grand generational allegory, just a
contemplative, though somewhat anxious, quiet. So why would we be interested
in such an apparently modest undertaking? At this point, the comics critic in
me wants to step in to say that the watercolour washed drawings are
fantastic, worth the price of admission alone. While this is true, I don’t
think it explains the greatness of <em>Trains Are…Mint</em>. That lies in the
way that East links psychological reflection to physical action in a way that
contrasts with Kerouac’s urgency.

	What catalyst for aesthetic and scientific discovery can match the simple
walk? As James Joyce taught us with <em>Ulysses</em> a walk around the city
that ends with a return home has an epic resonance. Oliver East’s venturing
out towards Blackpool, getting a little further each day and always returning
home at night, sets romantic adventure against domestic security. Threats and
obstacles exist largely in the mind and imagination, as they do for most
literature, but East’s engagement with them is as valid as any dragon
slaying. In a few places, East talks about how his <em>A to Z</em> fails him.
While these are anxious moments, they are also epiphanic ones: the only
reason to go on a physical or psychological journey is to find some place off
the map or outside the apparently encyclopedic totality of what we know.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[This post is about
scenes. Comics are all about scenes. I also think they get us thinking about
what actually makes up a scene. If a scene is, straight up, a space where any
event, real or imagined, takes place; it is also, as on stage, part of the
play that constitutes a unit of development—a fragment or part of something.
At the same time as the scene governs the formal space of the story, it is
also a term we use to identify a socio-cultural phenomena in which a cluster
of like-mindedness can be located geographically or, at the very least,
philosophically. Comics, like music, have their “scenes” — the West coast
independent movement in the 1960s and 70s with Crumb, Pekar and the like; the
New York School of Eisner and Speigelman, on and on it goes. I’m quite
certain that many other than I could delve into the intricacies of the
different comic’s scenes.

	What I think deserves attention is how these geographic or philosophical
like-mindedness pervades the creative space of comics. How its scenes are
intensely open. Looking at Kevin Huizenga’s <em>Gloriana</em> for instance
suggests that the scene in comics can borrow both from the vastness and
spacial play that seems so prevalent in comics and from the multiplicity of
perspective available to the formal construction of literature and film. It
would be to simple to say that Huizenga captures the scene from every angle,
but he gives it a shot. In so doing, he raises to our nose the concept of the
scene and how the conglomeration of images leads to a kind of shared
philosophy or guiding principle—it’s style by association in the same way
that every band from Seattle in the 1990s was “grunge.”

	However, on the level of story, Huizenga makes us think about the role of
the scene and one’s perspective of it. The comic is at once clustered and
frantic; empty and calm. It moves through pure abstraction <p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_2294.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter  wp-image-2203" title="IMG_2294"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_2294-1024x418.jpg
" alt="" width="614" height="251" /></a></p> to a deeply emotional
signification of emptiness.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_2296.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2205" title="IMG_2296"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_2296-225x300.jpg"
alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>

	The result is a discordance between scenes that suggests a common inner
conflict about how we perceive and represent out environment—our geography,
if you like. Metaphorically, it suggests something too about the
socio-cultural scenes I noted above—that they are at one point frantic, full
of catalysts and scattered ideas and in another instant they are devoid,
empty, over. Suffice to say, these scenes tell us a lot about the human
experience and harken back to a primal sense of community.

	Yet despite all this, comic artists still seem somehow bounded by the
guttered layout that forces scenes into fragments. It’s as if comics somehow
need to represent parts of a scene rather than the scene itself. Or, maybe
comics show us that, however tangentially, the scene is its parts. Margaux
Motin, whose yearning to be an anthropologist seems oddly appropriate to this
post, both abandons and uses the guttered space in her scenes. <p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_2300.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter  wp-image-2207" title="IMG_2300"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_2300-1024x735.jpg
" alt="" width="368" height="265" /></a></p> The franticness is far from
Huizenga’s black and white abstractions. The authors are clearly of two
different scenes. That said, as readers we encounter the page in both
instances as a scene, at once in parts and whole. We cannot help ourselves
from pulling these scenes forward. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_2299.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter  wp-image-2206" title="IMG_2299"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_2299-1024x732.jpg
" alt="" width="368" height="263" /></a></p> Margaux’s pages take on the
fading characteristics of the pages that came before it—both in her book and
in the work of others as influence. The scene when put in this context seems
endless; comics are but a series of ever-fading palimpsests continually
paralleling and layering scenes.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_2295.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2204" title="IMG_2295"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_2295-236x300.jpg"
alt="" width="236" height="300" /></a>

	Turning to artists like Chris Ware and Seth, the scene becomes a space
for another kind of juxtaposition. The scene for them is always intricate,
always building fragments into something bigger more tangible. It’s pretty
straightforward I’m afraid—not much for me to qualify. But what does it
suggest about the way comics enact the scene? The scene for comics is
different than for other genres—its static, but implies motion, temporal
movement; its impression is immediate (as the viewer’s eyes meet the page),
but its intricacies linger and impress further as we scan. <p

socio-cultural scene of comics is also responsive to its history (both as a
source of angst and of admiration), it has geographical locales, all of which
have their own meritocracy depending on who in the community you happen to be
talking to. There are current scenes in Seattle (Fantagraphics) and Montreal
(Drawn &amp; Quarterly) that tend toward independence from the large New York
/ West Coast houses, catering to the “exclusive crowd.” Suffice to say, those
who like and admire comics are part of a scene that is about making scenes
(with a pen / pencil). It’s worth thinking about how the collective
consciousness of these scenes infect the materiality of the scene—what it
produces, how it dies, and how it lingers both as static entity and evolving
form.

	In the beginning, we did not strive to preserve our language. Rather, we
painted the perceptions of our world and its existence in a scene that locked
our fragments in the association of images on the cave wall.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[While some of us have
the privilege of teaching graphic narrative courses or within graphic studies
departments and programs, many of us try to work graphic narratives into
existing disciplines and departments -- English, sociology, linguistics,
history, science -- of varying levels of conservativeness. The worthy space
for discussing comic books is well-established for those of us who would seek
out a blog like this one, but many of us interact day-to-day with colleagues
for whom this worth is either questionable or outright rejected.

	Having spent much of my fall semester engaging in these kinds of debates
in my own workplace, I found that my Christmas break thoughts were consumed
by determining the goals and intentions of my own work with graphic texts and
students.

	My own perspective was once quite naive on the whole topic. It never
occurred to me that the value or relevancy of comics was up for debate. As an
MA student, I TA'd a standard first year English course that included
Morrison and Quitely's WE3. My PhD course work in Digital Humanities brought
me frequently into contact with comics folks who seemed content and largely
settled in their work. As a fledgling instructor, no one blinked when I
taught comics alongside novels and poetry in my classes. And when I was
finishing my PhD, I went out on the job circuit with a lecture on Chester
Brown's LOUIS RIEL.

	So when I started to encounter resistance to using comics in a teaching
and learning context, I was really confused at first. And because it has
always been a part of my academic environment, I didn't have the vocabulary
to discuss why I think graphic texts belong in an undergraduate English
education. When an idea has never been challenged, sometimes we lack the
discussion points to make a case for what we do. So I've spent the last few
weeks trying to think with intentionality about why I believe in the value of
comics in the world of literary studies.

	<strong>1. The definition of literacy is shifting.</strong>

	I see very few English majors in the student body I teach, so I always
think of my job as being the person who will teach them how to read the world
effectively. I really feel I would be startlingly remiss in this goal if I
didn't talk to them about visual literacy. I can teach them rhetorical
strategies in text, and I do, but if we don't talk about how image can
ironize or undercut or trouble these messages -- something comics demonstrate
really well! -- then I haven't equipped them to critically consumer product
or political advertising or the varying levels of political bias on news
networks.

	We also seem to make this weird assumptions that are students are
visually literate. Why do we assume this? Where do we perceive they are
learning this? Are they absorbing this knowledge by osmosis? We would never
ever assume that students learn to read critically by just living in a world
with text. Why do we make this assumption about visual imagery?

	<strong>2. Comics look readily accessible on the surface but take
extensive cognitive work to engage with fully.</strong>

	This is the biggest stumbling block I find with colleagues who have never
tried teaching graphic content to students, and it ties in to the assumption
above that students somehow just know how to engage with visual texts.
Students may delight at first seeing graphic novels on an English course
(though I really believe this comes primarily from a desire just to see
something different in any form), but they actually tend to get anxious about
it in my experience, especially if they are not comic readers. If you ever
want to be comforted that text isn't dead (I don't know why that would be a
comfort to you, but imagining it would be for a moment), watch students
engage with a graphic novel for the first time. They cling to the text! They
want a straightforward narrative! They balk at analyzing the visual world of
the book!

	We all know that comics are equal parts pleasure and cognitive work (ok,
sometimes not equal!). It takes students longer to work through a graphic
text, especially the first time, than it does for them to work through a
comparable-length text in a genre they are familiar with. They're doing two
things at once: reading the prose, and learning to read the visual
signifiers. It's hard work to train oneself not to automatically privilege
the text, and it's excellent cognitive work to develop those skills in our
students.

	<strong>3. Comics prepare students well for all types of literary
studies.</strong>

	At the first year level, are we really doing much more than preparing
students to read texts attentively? If our focus is on attentive reading and
dealing with metaphor, imagery, allusion, and all those other fun devices, is
there any good reason not to do that within a mixture of genres? I guess what
I have a hard time understanding is how it harms a student's education to
expose them to graphic texts in a literary context. If the argument is simply
one of textual supremacy -- that the number of words on the page matters
above all else -- then I don't even know how to engage with that
point-of-view as it strikes me as so basically valueless. Surely the study of
literature is something more; is Atwood's "You Fit Into Me" a lesser poem
because it is only four lines? Are Blake's Songs of Innocence and Experience
lesser individually because their illustrations add so much? I don't know how
anyone would argue yes to both those things, and yet number of words on the
page is an actual argument I've faced in attempting to use graphic novels in
the classroom.

	I'm very much in the working stages of really developing an
intentionality around my desire to teach comics in a literary setting, and
I'd love this post to foster conversation around these and any other issues
related to graphic novels in the world of more conservative disciplines and
departments. Please leave your ideas in the comments, if you
would.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

Vanishing Points: Perspective in Jason Lutes’ “Berlin: City of

jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a>A few months back at Graphixia
when pondering over potential topics for consideration, Dave brought up an
excellent suggestion in a text that I’d only heard about before in passing:
Jason Lutes’ “Berlin,” which is still currently being published in serial
form by Drawn and Quarterly. Two collections are available now, “City of
Stones” and “City of Smoke,” with a third and final volume to follow once the
next eight issues have seen print. Given its historical bent, Berlin makes
for a useful follow-up to my most recent post on Tardi’s “<em>C’etait La
Guerre Des Tranchees</em>” as it chronicles the events leading up to the
Second World War, set against a backdrop of social strife and change as
narrated primarily by the fictional Kurt Severing, a lonely journalist, and
Marthe Muller, an aspiring artist seeking a modern education in the big city.
As a history major with a focus on WWII, I’ve long been fascinated with the
period in terms of the very clearly delineated portrayal of good and evil
that we find in our texts – given the easy iconography of a war that was
insistent on symbols, one would think historical accounts would lend
themselves to graphic narrative, though these are few and far between. Lutes,
however, does not take this easy way out in recounting the war; rather, he
focuses on the much more challenging retelling of the city’s slow transition
to fascism through the cultural nuances of the period a few years prior to
the war. The first volume concentrates far more on the Communist leanings of
the period and delves into the personal narratives of multiple characters’
experience of the period.

	Despite the uneasy undercurrent of war throughout the narrative and an
elucidation of the cultural values that swayed German society at the tail end
of the Weimar Republic, Berlin is far more about perspective in history,
storytelling and in art. The title of the first volume, “City of Stones,”
comes from the end of the third chapter, as Severing describes the futility
of those who would write history into existence in a veritable sea of voices
all attempting the same purpose. Living in the “newspaper district,” Severing
can hear the journalists and novelists out his window clacking at their keys,
attempting to channel the fragmented present into print for their own
purposes. He imagines each of these pages as stones, each tossed into the
river of human memory, disrupting the flow until all that is left is a marsh
of experience that is, he implies, meaningless and shallow in its record
because of its now diffuse nature. One is reminded of Plato’s Phaedrus and
writing as a means of forgetting – we are, at times, so inundated with
stories that we become immune to their significance, divorced as they are
from the personalities of their authors and by the emotional and personal
context surrounding their emergence. Once chronicled, they become a sea of
voices that b<a

img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2263"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/berlinstones1.jpg"
alt="" width="506" height="439" /></a>og down any ability for us to
comprehend any verity of an event. This rumination encapsulates Berlin’s
frustration with history, as Lutes is not intent on delivering a clearly
defined series of events that must have led to the predictable, inevitable
outcome of tyranny and war; instead, we are presented with personal,
disconnected lives that attempt to capture a larger cultural moment without
judgment or bias. These various disjointed subplots that run throughout
Berlin allow Lutes to channel this metaphoric river for the purposes of a
more truthful, human understanding of the interwar period; as Severing puts
it, “if each stone is placed carefully and with purpose, perhaps something
can be built. Not to dam the current, but to divert it” (Lutes 80). These
stories, though fiction, accomplish exactly this: Lutes condenses the
diversity of cultural experience paradoxically through his singular
encapsulation of disparate voices.

	In its multifaceted account, “Berlin” is reminiscent of Isherwood’s 1939
“Berlin Stories” (later to become “Cabaret”) which attempted much the same
feat. Lutes, however, changes the dynamic by capitalizing on the graphic form
of delivery as not simply a medium, but a motif in explaining the shaping
nature of perspective on our understanding of history and storytelling.
Marthe, going to art school in Berlin, attends a lecture on perspective in
modern art and the instructor’s privileging of exact realism through the
application of scientific methods in relation to accurately depicting
objects. The instructor, Schenk, concentrates on the vanishing point on the
horizon, directing students to a window and asking them to imagine it as a
framed picture (which is interestingly, in this context, exactly what it is –
framed once by the window and then again by the comics’ panel). He highlights
the fact that based on one’s perspective, the point at which objects
disappear, and later at which they appear, is entirely dependent on the
viewer. In relation to the narrative, Lutes subtly implies the limitations of
singular vision, a fact reiterated in the following panel depicting a woodcut
by Albrecht Durer. Here, the cold image highlighting the scientific
perspective applied to art appears ironically far less realistic and engaging
precisely because of its attempts at realism, juxtaposed with the vibrant
characterization and clean lines of Lutes’ own, more comic drawings. The
students, debating after class, similarly point out the flaws in a system
that privileges this sanitized, exact approach to rationalizing <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/berlinart.jpg"><img
class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2264"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/berlinart.jpg" alt=""
width="549" height="477" /></a>the world. Marthe states “it’s flawed on the
face of it. If I understand this ‘appearing point’ idea correctly, it
presumes a one-eyed view of the world. Which reduces the effect of reality by
half. Or one third, if we’re talking about dimensions” (Lutes 104). The
subtext of this scene returns us to the import of understanding the world
through multiple perspectives seen at once, in one context and in a way that
is human because of its multiplicity. These perspectives, or again the stones
carefully placed, allow us a more holistic understanding of both past and
present, an important component of "Berlin" consistently emphasized by the
recurring debates between its characters and the construction of the images
that shift depending on which protagonist dominates the scene.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Berlinbed.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2265"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Berlinbed-232x300.jpg
" alt="" width="232" height="300" /></a>What the reader is presented with is
a work of historical fiction that, while offering a stable backdrop of
chronological events, creates a parallax view which suggests any singular
account of history, understood without the nuanced perceptions of the often
irrational, emotional and altogether human experiences of the moment is
shortsighted, limiting and even potentially dangerous. Near the end of the
first volume, we see each of the significant characters we’ve followed laying
in their respective beds on the eve of May 1<sup>st</sup> 1929, the Worker’s
Day riots, each about to experience a significant cultural moment in
different ways, with each perspective no less “real” a historical
understanding of the moment than the next. Berlin is, at its core, an
acknowledgement that to understand history is to recognize the authenticity
of varied perspectives, with each vanishing or appearing point legitimate
even if it exists in conflict with another.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[This post is a truly
collaborative effort to mark our 100th post and introduce readers to a few
new contributors. We're each reflecting upon where we stand in relation to
comics and, of course, doing a little reminiscing about our experiences with
Graphixia. Thanks for reading Graphixia!

	<strong><a href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/author/wilkinsp/"
target="_blank">Peter Wilkins:</a></strong>

	My big question for my relationship to comics emerges as a questioning of
the usefulness and interestingness of my literary background in relation to
comics criticism: what about the visual array?

	By this question, I don’t mean only “what about the pictures?” because
they are but one of the features that distinguishes comics from prose
literature, one of the ways that comics makes the eye work the page
differently than prose.

	And yet “narrative” and “storytelling” remain the dominant terms in the
critical discourse on comics, with occasional nods to page structure, panel
shape, and artist’s line.  A corollary of this issue is that writers perhaps
get too much credit. While the divide between writer and artist on the one
hand makes comics a collaborative art form, on the other hand, it continues
the privilege on verbal concept over the visual expression of that concept,
even if the writer has something to do with how the page looks.

	But, if we celebrate comics written and drawn by a single person, we may
be retreating to a romantic notion of authorship and creativity that is
problematic. Still, if you think about it, the usually clearly demarcated
division of labour between the writer and the artist, perpetuates those
notions as well. Maybe we need to see more comics where the line between
writer and artist is more blurry.

	I want to think about comics using more precise terms and concepts, that
apply more specifically to comics and less to narrative in general.

	Meanwhile, cognitive psychologist and comics enthusiast Neil Cohn has
been conducting research that shows that the brain processes comics in the
same way as it processes written sentences. Comics, it turns out, have a
grammar after all, and “visual grammar” is similar to verbal grammar. Cohn’s
research appears to confirm Scott McCloud’s theory of sequentiality in
<em>Understanding Comics</em>.

	OK, so reading comics as we read prose appears to be the “natural” way to
read comics. But that way is not the only way, and learning to “look at” and
“see” comics is as important as learning to “read” them. To do so requires a
willful derangement of all the perceptions. I know I’m not the only person
trying to view comics this way. It’s not even particularly rare.
Nevertheless, for me it’s important because otherwise I might as well be
reading and writing about conventional novels.

	As far as what I’m looking at at the moment goes, I’m spending a lot of
time on the Hernandez brothers, and I’m concerned because I fear my affection
for them is based on a contradiction of everything I say above. I’m also
thinking a lot about Jordan Crane and his excellent <em>Uptight</em> series.

	<strong><a href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/author/admin/"
target="_blank">David N. Wright:</a></strong>

	It’s a little known fact that Graphixia was actually born, in part, out
of a desire to establish the Canadian Society for Studies in the Graphic
Narrative. The afterglow of that endeavour lingers in Graphixia’s web address
which, though soon to be changed (hint, hint), still collects the
representative society letters. That said, the whole society thing is a good
starting point for how my perspective on comics has changed as I have
lingered over the commentaries offered in this space.

	The first and most obvious transformation is in what I call comics. I
used to get all hung up on debates about what to call comics. You can see it
in the society name: “graphic narrative.” I still get drawn into debates
about nomenclature, but for the most part I really like just calling comics
comics, or strips, or books. I’m more comfortable with what they are and more
comfortable not being drawn into theoretical debates that don’t really
advance the conversation.

	The second and more obscure change is apparent in the diversity of
subject-matter I have tackled. When I came into this, I was pretty canonical.
I was all <em>Maus</em>, <em>Watchmen</em>, <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>
and maybe a few other fairly well-known, canonical, comics. I really didn’t
see comics as a medium with depth. Sure, there were intricate story-lines and
rich histories, but I tended to dismiss these things in favour of the single
closed narrative. As it stands, I am no more interested in intricate
story-lines or rich histories, but I do cast my net much wider. I read with
more depth and I tend to choose from a more diverse set of comics that
reflect that effort.

	I’ll end with this: where I stand in relation to comics is with the crew
at Graphixia. Comics are often a private thing, a secret under the covers,
between you and the flashlight. If the last 100 posts has yielded anything,
it’s a community. And that’s awesome.

	I’ve always read a lot of Canadian comics as an extension of my interest
in Canadian cultural production, generally.  But I also had a full set of
Marvel trading cards and a healthy collection of <em>Beano</em> comics.  So,
I stumbled upon the Graphixia project because I happened to become employed
where Dave and Peter are employed and they needed a comic-liking Canadianist
to yell at about <em>Louis Riel</em> and I kind of think they thought I might
be cool enough.  I had never really thought of comics scholarship as separate
from the multimodal intertextual visual cultural work I cheekily call English
literature out of a need to be employed somewhere -- my work has always
involved “reading” public art and tv shows and film and web documents in
addition to more traditional modes of literature, and I saw comics as an
extension of that.  I mostly just wandered around doing whatever I wanted, as
is my custom, typically.

	I was a naive reader, approaching comics from the perspective of a fan
and cobbling together a philosophy of reading comics that drew from all sorts
of different theoretical backgrounds--sort of an inch deep and a mile wide.
 I’m not sure I’ve developed greater nuance in my reading, but I’m more aware
of the limitations of my approach.

	I think being involved with Graphixia has helped to inform me of the
depth and breadth of issues around comics scholarship and become aware of
more controversy than I probably cared to be, really.  I’ve had the
opportunity to take the comics show on the road and find out that it’s worth
being a comics scholar just to hang out with other comics scholars, who are
super fun.  The debates and discussion and collaborations have been powerful;
I’m a better comics reader now for my more developed understanding.  But I
also (pretend to) care less.

	I love anniversary issues. Graphixia reaching the milestone of #100 feels
like a significant achievement, and I wish there was a way to give it a
die-cut, holographic cover and polybag it with a button and a poster, though
it seems like this kind of fanfare is an anachronism in the wake of digital
publishing. My time with Graphixia has been enlightening, as it’s changed not
only the types of comics I read but the way in which I engage with them.
Being the Graphixia “archivist,” I’ve been collecting comics, predominantly
of the superhero variety, since I was around ten years old. I remember my
first subscription service at the (now defunct) comicshop <em>Talkin’
Illustrations</em> in Surrey, cutting class every Wednesday to pick up the
latest issues of the multiple series that I read even at that early age.
Giving a history of my experiences with the medium over the years, however,
would ultimately turn into a David Copperfield-sized tome, so instead I’ll
leave it at this: comics were a significant part of my formative years, and
they shaped how I engaged with the world. Through the intricately woven
fictions of the DC, Marvel and Image universes, I was able to access morality
and strength of character as filtered through the metaphors of the fantastic,
bringing me outside of (or strangely deeper into) the surface reality of day
to day living. I also learned to appreciate order, continuity and
organization, desirous of consuming every story written for my favorite
characters. The consistency in these universes brought consistency to mine as
well, part of the reason I harped on it so much in my early posts.

	Because I’ve been so heavily invested in comics throughout my life
(again, I have a collection of over 20,000 individual issues and growing),
I’d never really felt a pressing need to justify them as objects of study –
for me, their value as literature and pedagogical tools has always been
inherent, aspects of the medium that are self-evident because I experienced
them firsthand. I did recognize though that they’ve had somewhat of an uphill
battle in terms of recognition by academia, and even those “progressive”
profs who integrated them into my coursework during my BA and MA still
treated them as different, as being outside the canonical norm of studied
literature even while extolling their virtues, often patting themselves on
the back for including one in their curricula (but never actually suggesting
them for essay topics). So comics reading and analysis was something I always
pursued in private, sharing insights typically only around the comic shop
with other addicts on Wednesdays as new issues landed in our respective
boxes. The vast majority of my English work was instead centred on Early
Modern studies, with some Modernism thrown in for good measure.

	Enter Graphixia. I’d known Peter and David for some time, having done
marking for them at Douglas college since the start of my MA at Simon Fraser.
I was surprised to see that not only were several graphic novels on the
reading lists for their classes, they were treated as being legitimate works
and not literary eccentricities of the medium.  I found this perspective
inspiring (even if many of the first year papers I was tasked with grading on
these texts were decidedly not), and having discussed my nerdy obsession with
comics with both instructors at length, I was invited to join in the monthly
contributions of the then relatively new blog.

	Writing about comics from an academic standpoint has been, I’ve found,
very illuminating. Having kept my thoughts on the medium largely to myself
and not having written much on it prior to Graphixia, my observations were
largely jumbled and disorganized regarding how I understood it – it’s been an
interesting experience organizing these into the series of mini-essays that
I’ve contributed, as I’ve been able to hash out some of the reasons as to why
I appreciate comics so much, presenting them not just to our readers but
also, in a way, to myself for the first time. I’ve also found that working in
collaboration with others on comics has broadened my horizons beyond what I
now recognize were the limiting confines of the superhero genre – of course
I’d read some texts like <em>Maus</em> and <em>Persepolis</em>, though I have
to admit that prior to the suggestions by the team my scope of reading was
largely confined to extensions of the fantastic superhero stories that I read
as a child. Not that I now read these any less, still ordering around fifty
titles a month, though I appreciate them more as I realize they play a part
in a larger canon of works, some of which experiment with the form simply in
terms of panelling and guttering that I never thought possible.

	So what has struck me most about the Graphixia project is this: I’ve now
realize that I’ve done myself a disservice by keeping my love of comics to
myself over the years and not tailoring my writing around what arguably
actually drew me to study English in the first place. Only really through
dialogue and exchange with others can we understand our own passions
regarding literature or, for that matter, anything else at all. In his
“Defense of Poetry,” Shelley writes that “neither the eye nor the mind can
see itself, unless reflected upon that which it resembles,” and I think that
the statement certainly applies to studying comics or any other medium as
well: by understanding how others have engaged with comics and what has
driven them to pursue their own studies, I better understand my own
motivations that have long only been the subtext of my academic pursuits, and
this understanding increases with each weekly post - I only wish I’d been
involved with a similar project earlier in my studies. So, for the patently
selfish reasons I’ve outlined above, here’s to Graphixia! I can’t wait to see
what our next hundred issues have to offer.

	I’d always read comics in one form or another, whether it was
<em>Bunty</em>, <em>Peanuts</em> or <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em>, however a
rather casual interest turned serious when my friend Dan recommended that I
read Preacher, I was hooked. Since then, thanks to two rather excellent and
inspiring English teachers at my secondary school, who encouraged me to use
<em>Maus</em> as a key text in my A Levels, I’ve often attempted to
incorporate comics into my literary analysis. I was lucky enough to study
Text/Image interaction via emblems and bande dessinée during my Undergrad and
then to end up in a programme that encourages people to embark upon PhDs on
things like graffiti or Québécois comics.

	I’m a fast reader, kids at school used to amuse themselves timing me, my
Mum stopped buying me books as gifts when I was about 6, as I “read them too
fast to really enjoy them”, however one of the benefits of learning to read
and write about comics is that it has, I think, made me a better reader of
prose texts. I am wont to take more time over reading a page, I actually stop
to think about what I have just read and I even occasionally reread a page to
make sure I have understood it. With my background in literary studies I am
constantly catching myself giving precedence to my analysis of the text,
however as I become better read, as I become better at reading comics, I find
my approach to the image changing. Learning how others approach comics is one
of my favourite things about chatting to my fellow comics scholars.

	At the moment I’m working on the theory chapter of my thesis, so to take
my mind off theories that make my brain hurt I’ve been revisiting some of my
favourite books. Peter’s recent post about Oliver East’s <em>Trains are...
Mint</em> meant that I turned to that first of all, while I have since been
enjoying Jimmy Beaulieu’s <em>Le Moral des Troupes</em> and rereading the
whole of the <em>Fables</em> series so far. Next up I am going to be reading
Guy Delisle’s <em>Jerusalem</em>, which I am very much looking forward to.

	However, despite all of my enthusiasm for reading and writing about
comics, I sometimes find myself mumbling an answer to the question “So what
do you do?” or else breezily responding “I’m working on a PhD about Québécois
Literature and the Nationalist Movement” and then swiftly moving the
conversation on to safer ground, so that I won’t get the universal ‘You Study
Comics?!?!?!’ face in response. I know that I shouldn’t be reticent about
sharing the subject of my research with others, Comics are cool, and they can
be important and exciting and we should let ourselves get excited and
passionate about them in front of everyone, not just our fellow comics
lovers. So, I am really looking forward to being part of Graphixia and
getting overexcited about comics, in public, once every six weeks or so. An
avid reader of the site I can’t wait to see what my fellow Graphixians are
going to educate and/or excite me about over the next 100 posts!

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have ambivalent
feelings about comics adaptations of works of literature. Freud says that
while ambivalence involves feelings of love and hate, it really means hate.
That is, whenever we say we are ambivalent about something, we really mean
that we don’t like it. My negative feelings towards adaptation come from a
sense that it asserts the secondarity of comics to other literature. While
I’m sure there are novelizations of Superman and Batman, I doubt that anyone
is coming up with a prose remediation of Jaime Hernandez’ <em>Locas</em>.
Part and parcel of this secondarity is the notion that the comic is a dumbing
down of the original text: the easy version. </p>

	<p>For Christmas, I received a copy of <em>The Graphic Canon</em> and for
all the great artists whose work appears in it—Eisner, Crumb—I can’t help but
feel it is more about the literature than the comics. There’s no Tintin,
Asterix, or Batman in it. </p>

	<p>Richard Appignanesi (writer) and Slawa Harasymowicz’ (illustrator)
adaptation of Freud’s most famous case study, <em>The Wolf Man</em>, the
first in what appears to be a series entitled <em>Graphic Freud</em> from
Self-Made Hero, gives me some reason to rethink my attitude, though my
reservations persist. </p>

	<p>For one thing, so much in Freud involves “seeing.” <em>The Wolf
Man</em> is particularly known for being the first appearance of “the primal
scene” in Freud, where the child sees his or her parents having sex. And when
Freud refers to “screen memories,” he’s talking about one image standing in
front of another, preventing us from seeing the truth. Freud’s theory is
essentially apocalyptic, and like most apocalyptic theories, it is as much
about the veil as what lies beneath it. </p>

	<p>In Freud’s view, the truths of both the perceived outside world and
the intuited inner one are impossible to see, thanks to our own defensive
occlusions. To see them would be like looking directly into the sun, so our
only option is to study the veil. The cartoon image and comics’ reliance on
“the scene” to refer to David’s last post, are good models of the veiledness
of the real. The condensations and distortions of icon and caricature may not
only be signs and symbols for things in the world; they may also figure our
mental processing of the real. The cartoon image is an exposure of the shadow
of the thing, the reflection on the wall of Plato’s “Allegory of the Cave.”
</p>

	<p>So there’s a great opportunity here to create a “theoretical comic,”
one that tests the relationship between the medium and Freud’s ideas. But
Appignanesi and Harasymowicz seem ambivalent about that opportunity. If
anything, <em>The Wolf Man</em> is somewhat timid in drawing the relationship
between the medium of comics and the subject of its adaptation. There isn’t
enough reflexivity in the book. </p>

	<p>For those who don’t know it, <em>The Wolf Man</em> concerns the
problems of an aristocratic Russian, Sergei Pankejeff, who earns his nickname
from the fact that he has a dream in which he sees a number of white wolves
sitting in a tree outside his bedroom window. </p>

	<p>This turns out to be the least of his problems. He suffers from
repressed homosexuality, various venereal diseases, psychosomatic gum
boils&#8230;. He is one seriously messed-up dude. To make matters worse, he
appears to be the most irritating kind of psychoanalytic patient: the one who
knows something about psychoanalysis. </p>

	<p>Harasymowicz’ drawing style is rough and sketchy. At times it looks
more psychedelic than psychoanalytic, but then she is trying to capture the
interior of Sergei’s mind. She has some great one- and two-page splashes that
interpret the images of Sergei’s memory. These pages represent looking inward
rather than outward and require some identifying features to indicate that
innerness. Not only that, we need to see the various conversions, inversions,
distortions, and repressions that someone as troubled as Sergei goes through.
</p>

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Freud-001.jpeg"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Freud-001-224x300.
jpeg" alt="" title="Freud 001" width="224" height="300" class="aligncenter
size-medium wp-image-2287" /></a>

	<p>But the writing of <em>The Wolf Man</em> treats the case study as a
kind of fictionalized dialogue between Freud and Sergei. Freud’s case studies
are more like dramatic monologues than conversations, as he teases out the
nuances of what his patients’ stories have revealed to him, and explains them
to us, his readership. There’s a fundamental narratological problem with
<em>The Wolf Man</em>: there is too much emphasis on what is told rather than
in the mode of telling. For Freud, the mode of telling is crucial. Who talks
and who listens and how makes all the difference. </p>

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Freud-003.jpeg"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Freud-003-233x300.
jpeg" alt="" title="Freud 003" width="233" height="300" class="aligncenter
size-medium wp-image-2290" /></a>

	<p>Any adaptation involves condensation and displacement of the material
it works with. It’s unrealistic, uninteresting, and un-Freudian to expect an
adaptation to be “true to the original.” But I wanted an adaptation whose
distortion captivates the imagination as much as Sergei’s dream of the wolves
sitting in the tree outside his window. </p>

;a=1401238920" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />. What’s striking
about Cooke’s work is how his art reflects the aesthetics of the 1950s. In
fact, he’s been somewhat typecast as the go-to artist for “hard-boiled”
stories that need to reflect a 1930–50's aesthetic (like the aforementioned
<em>Minutemen</em> series).

	What interests me about Cooke is the way he represents adaption in comics
on a number of levels. He’s adapted hard-boiled crime novels
(<em>Parker</em>) into excellent books the highlights of which are the sharp
and elegant lines that reinforce the subject-matter (a classic poke in the
argument about the relationship between form and content). Cooke was also
part of two adaptive re-boots: The <em>Minutemen</em> series that prequeled
the canonical Watchmen and Catwoman who Cooke re-imagined with the same
panache that dominates his Parker adaptation. <p style="text-align:
center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0249.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter  wp-image-2303" title="IMG_0249"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0249.jpg" alt=""
width="277" height="368" /></a></p> At the same time, Cooke has adapted the
1930's and 50's aesthetic to suit his own aesthetic principles and has, as a
result, carved out a niche for himself in the comics world. Cooke’s art is at
once intensely original and strongly derivative. His works harkens back to
the general move in the 1950s away from the circular, centreline  formula of
drawing cartoon characters toward a more sharp-edged or expressionistic style
reflective of the entrenchment of Modernism. His work belongs to an era where
“artists conceived a bold visual style that was derived from the modern arts,
assimilating and adapting the principles of Cubism, Surrealism, and
Expressionism” (Amidi 7). At the time, such moves were seen as expanding the
definitions of cartooning (or comics) and incorporating elements of graphic
design into a low-brow artform. It was an era where artists in popular media
forms such as animation, cartooning, and comics “renewed emphasis on the
linear nature of the medium, and the use of the line was more pronounced,
often playing as important a role in delineating character as shapes and
forms" (Amidi 10). <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0246-
e1360181910496.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2304" title="IMG_0246"

e1360181910496.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="206" /></a></p> What Cooke
does then is adapt the emerging aesthetic of animation and design in the
1950s in order to serve his own aesthetic principles. On another level, Cooke
is also making apparent the always already status of comicbook artist as
adapter. There are only a finite number of character types in the comic
world, just as there are in Literature, or other art forms. Our creative and
representative impulses are always somewhat limited by the scope of our
humanity. Comicbook artists in particular are constrained by the norms of the
medium which, in some sense, demand a return to the basic tenets of either
history (the origin story) or a set of aesthetic principles. Most comicbook
artists, whether mainstream or not, can point out the manner in which their
art builds on or reacts to the work of earlier artists in the medium (or
other media for that matter). <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0252.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter  wp-image-2305" title="IMG_0252"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0252.jpg" alt=""
width="277" height="368" /></a></p> The originality of Cooke’s art is not
necessarily in the art itself, but how he adapts it. He doesn't seem to make
any pretences about the originality of his art beyond its simple
presentation. That said, within the aesthetic there are clear signs that he
is intensely invested in the era and the aesthetic principles that represent
it. He draws the <em>Parker</em> series in two tones only, picking one colour
as dominant for each adaptation (yellow, blue, grey are the dominant single
colours depending on the edition). His art then reflects the pulp printing of
his subject and its position at the epoch of its era. A cynical critic could
accuse Cooke of simply copying a style of art and doing nothing wholly
original with it, but this would ignore the careful craftsmanship that goes
into making an adaptation look like a “pure” adaptation, one that loses no
fidelity in its translation from one era or author to another. <p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0251.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter  wp-image-2306" title="IMG_0251"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0251.jpg" alt=""
width="277" height="368" /></a></p> The sharpness of Cooke’s line is his
adaptive nod to the aesthetics he values. Those lines are representative in
that they reflect that move to incorporate the principles of graphic design
and the inspiration of the Modern arts. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0247.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter  wp-image-2307" title="IMG_0247"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0247.jpg" alt=""
width="277" height="368" /></a></p> At the same time, the lines are
metaphoric; they hold within them the stylistic flourish of the earlier
artists in other media from which Cooke takes his cues—the Madison avenue Art
Department’s, the television animators, and the hard-lined <em>Dick
Tracy</em>. Finally, those lines are intensely personal, expressing Cooke’s
own stake in the graphic archive and his flair for making the established or
entrenched appear wholly original again.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm so very excited
that we're doing adaptations this month, because a friend introduced me to
one last week that I'm completely in love with: <a
href="http://limbero.org/jl8/">JL8</a>, Yale Stewart's re-imaging of the
Justice League if they were eight year olds.  It's amazing.

	<a href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/9.jpg"><img
class="alignnone  wp-image-2326" title="9"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/9-1024x351.jpg"
alt="" width="717" height="246" /></a>

	I've been talking a lot about adaptation lately because my students have
been doing some work on adaptation with <em>Scott Pilgirm's Precious Little
Life </em>and its film version.  One of the things we've been discussing is
how one way of deeming an adaptation "successful" is if you learn more about
or deepen your understanding of a character through the adaptation.
 Adaptations, when they are really strong, can give us another way into the
text that can nuance our interpretation of the source material.

	That is certainly true of this delightful webcomic series JL8.  While
it's called JL8, and while all the characters (and even some of the villains
-- and yes, Lex Luthor was a dbag even when he was 8) get a look-in, the
character the series really focuses on is Batman.  Little Bruce Wayne, and
the way he responds to his friends and the grownups around him, definitely
offers a new way of thinking about the Caper Crusader.

	The comic series takes place after Bruce is orphaned, so we get a sense
of the depth of his loneliness in some really beautifully constructed panels.

	<a href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/27.jpg"><img
class="alignnone  wp-image-2328" title="27"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/27-1024x680.jpg"
alt="" width="717" height="476" /></a>

	Bruce is little and lonely and scared, and his lack of connection to home
and family fuels his need to keep the structure of his school life intact,
and helps to explain his desire to control and shape the interactions of his
peers.  We see in this early Bruce Wayne all that will go on to define him as
a full-grown superhero and iconic character: he broods, he holds grudges, he
is powered by loneliness and anger. Stewart's use of Superman as a foil shows
Clark Kent's homelife and stability as motivation for his good-guy persona.
 In one story arc, all the boys are upset when their apprehending of a thief
(because she was stealing from a Nana and no one steals from a Nana!) is
reported as a story about little boys.  They want to be seen as men!  But
where Bruce/Batman's concern with reputation and appearance makes him vaguely
insane (believing the purse-snatching was staged for the purpose of defaming
his character), Clark/Superman ends the story arc by asserting that
appearances only matter to people who don't.  Harsh.

	I like this series because it gets at Bruce Wayne in a manner that both
humanizes him and points out his character flaws.

	<a href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/10.jpg"><img
class="alignnone  wp-image-2330" title="10"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/10-1024x351.jpg"
alt="" width="717" height="246" /></a>

	But it also makes clear that while these behavioural issues and flaws
emerge from his traumatized past, that past also makes him the hero the
playground needs.

	<a href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/23.jpg"><img
class="alignnone  wp-image-2332" title="23"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/23-1024x356.jpg"
alt="" width="717" height="249" /></a>

	Basically it's an adorable series and example of why playing with these
archetypal characters in varying adaptations can be so useful -- even for the
most slavishly canonical among us.  Imaging these characters into other
situations -- ones that explain where they come from and what has shaped
their behaviour -- can help to deepen or nuance characters who can, over
time, start to feel flat and distant from our experiences.

	Go read JL8.  So friggin' cute.]]></content:encoded>

Adapting Adaptations: First Publishing’s Classics Illustrated</title>

alt="" width="192" height="300" /></a>I’ve always had a fondness for comic
book adaptations, both of film and of literature – I find that there’s often
a fuzzy line between media, particularly when they’re visual, and sometimes I
enjoy the difficulty I encounter in attempting to remember whether an image
came from a film or from its subsequent graphic adaptation (though in recent
years, this direction of translation has clearly been dramatically reversed).
One of the earliest series I collected as a child was First Publishing’s
<em>Classics Illustrated</em>, and though this may seem the low-lying fruit
of adaptation as a topic, the series deserves acknowledgement for the way it
changed expectations of the genre. First’s 1990 version of <em>Classics
Illustrated</em>, the third volume to bear the name, showcased experimental
writers, unpredictable (and often surreal) artists, innovative methods of
juxtaposing text with images and a prestige squarebound format on rich paper
stock to highlight the import of the stories. Published only a few years
after the transformative <em>Dark Knight Returns</em>, <em>Classics
Illustrated</em> was intent on demonstrating the difference between a comic
book and a graphic novel, insistent through its art and storytelling that it
be set aside from both its contemporaries in the superhero genre and its
predecessors in the often crudely drawn and bland retellings of the English
canon that readers encountered in the previous manifestations of the title.
It was easily the classiest component of my early collection, and it was
always what I pointed to when attempting to show the merits of the medium to
others.

alt="" width="191" height="300" /></a>First’s <em>Classics Illustrated</em>,
as I see it, is itself an adaptation of a series based on adaptation. The
differences across the volumes are staggering, and though these indicate a
general evolution in the comics’ medium on the whole, that the series bears
the same name speaks to its reliance on the marketing done by its forebears –
First’s version of <em>Classics Illustrated</em> seems intent of producing
adaptations in which the attention paid to the image was equal to the quality
of the text it represented. An example can be seen in the difference between
these two versions of <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>, one my father’s copy and the
other my own. The art improved and became more experimental (with Bill
Sienkiewicz’s fully painted, dreamlike <em>Moby Dick</em> and the
watercolours of Tom Mandrake’s <em>Hamlet </em>being standouts), and the
shift is indicative of an important transition in comics – though these are
still entrypoints for youth to engage with literature, First suggests a
different approach in eschewing traditional images couched in realism. By
offering experimental format, guttering and art, these adaptations promote a
more metaphoric engagement with the text that operates both at the visual as
well as the literary level.

src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/alice11.jpg" alt=""
width="453" height="517" /></a>Kyle Baker’s take on <em>Alice in
Wonderland</em> is a strong case in point, as the surrealism of the images
juxtaposed by text that lies outside its panels calls for the story to be
accessed in two separate ways, promoting a metatextual reading that is at the
heart of literary criticism. Baker takes full advantage of the affordances of
the medium to prompt engagement in a way previously unexploited in retelling
the classics in graphic form. The separation of word and image here
ironically draws them closer together, calling for an interaction with the
text that is more nuanced and subjective. It is less cartoonish than it is
exploratory, toying with the imaginative hyperbole inherent in the original.
Though the story remains a faithful retelling, through its art it is infused
with a slanted interpretation that emphasizes a personal response instead of
a simple transcription with the goal of guiding its readers to the original
novel. Here and in the rest of First’s <em>Classics Illustrated </em>series,
we see for the first time that adaptation in comics allows for these
revisionings to have literary merit in their own right, adding to our
understanding of the source material and taking it in a potentially different
direction rather than simply regurgitating it for younger audiences.

	<a href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/md1.jpg"><img

width="416" height="806" /></a>Bolter and Grusin note that “a medium is that
which remediates. It is that which appropriates the techniques, forms, and
social significance of other media and attempts to rival or refashion them in
the name of the real” (65). While this is true of the English canon being
translated into graphic novels, remediation can also happen within a medium
itself – comics, and the motivations behind both narrative and image, have
changed so significantly over the decades that they are hardly even
comparable. The shift we see in <em>Classics Illustrated</em>, which was
similarly present during the same timeframe in Morrison and Dave McKean’s
<em>Arkham Asylum</em>, indicates a poststructuralist turn in the medium that
accesses our collective desire for more depth out of literature (as the
panels to the left taken from <em>Moby Dick</em> clearly show). As
<em>Classics Illustrated</em> was my first foray into most of these canonical
texts, I have an affinity for the way they helped me learn to read – not with
a focus on understanding the reality of the text, but acknowledging that I
could refashion it to my liking through subjective interpretation, using the
dialogue and setting as suggestions to pursue alternate readings and make its
reality more my own. One can argue that the medium of comics has evolved over
the last hundred years, but I’m more of the mind that it has only adapted to
our literary and cultural expectations based on the precedents it set for
itself in its earlier manifestations.

saw that the theme for my first ‘proper’ post on Graphixia was to be about
Adaptation. I am a big fan of ‘cover versions’ whether musical, literary or
cinematic and this seemed like the ideal opportunity to rabbit on about one
of my favourite comics. Just as I tend to prefer a musical cover version that
does something new with the material (one of the reasons that I love <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzZhtrsbJzs">Ryan Adam’s ‘Wonderwall’
</a>and can’t bring myself to be bothered by <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aplWTXEcY70">Alexandra Burke’s
‘Hallelujah</a>’) so I quite like my literary adaptations to do something new
and a bit different with their source stories. This is particularly true in
the case of reinterpretations or adaptations of fairy tales; I have certainly
read enough straight up and down retellings of Sleeping Beauty for one
lifetime.

	<em>1001 Nights of Snowfall</em> is a spin off from the ever-popular
<em>Fables</em> series created by Bill Willingham. In case you haven’t read
or heard of <em>Fables</em> it takes characters from fairy tales and
re-imagines them in a contemporary setting, forced into exile from their
homelands by a mysterious figure known as The Adversary. They now reside in
Uptown New York in an enclave they have named Fabletown.

	<em>Fables</em> itself offers many opportunities for discussion of the
particular perks and pitfalls of adaptation, however it is the spinoff,
<em>1001 Nights of Snowfall</em> that was published in 2006, that I would
like to discuss here. Published in hardback form in 2006, with illustrations
from artists such as Charles Vess, Jill Thompson and Brian Boll, <em>1001
Nights of Snowfall</em> takes the opportunity to retell some of the origins
stories of the most po<a

jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2412 alignright" title="james jean

300x192.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="192" /></a>pular characters appearing
in <em>Fables</em> in the form of an adaptation of the Arabian Nights story.
Set in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, as Snow White travels as an emissary from
Fabletown to the Arabian Fables’ lands in order to try to form an alliance,
she is held prisoner by the Sultan and threatened with death. Snow delays her
seemingly inevitable execution by weaving a fantastic tale every evening.
Each tale is illustrated by a different artist in a noticeably different
style; from John Bolton’s dreamlike art that softens the horrors contained
with his tale, to James Jean’s use of a limited colour palette of greens and
greys to tell the story of the Frog Prince. The changes in artwork as the
book shifts from tale to tale subtly remind the reader of the passing of time
within the larger story of Snow’s agreement with the Sultan.

	<em>1001 Nights of Snowfall</em> presents just ten of these supposed
tales, varying in length and depth. So far, so conventional, however this is
where the conventionality ends as Willingham takes the opportunity to weave a
thread of darkness through each of these stories. So in a reversal of the
expected dynamic, a brave hare is transformed into a prince until such a time
as he manages to find true love with a female hare. While Bigby Wolf, you may
know him better as the Big Bad Wolf, has his origins and later irascible
personality explained with the tragic tale of how his mother died alone of a
broken heart after bearing the North Wind a litter of cubs.

width="130" height="184" /></a>

	However my favourites in the collection are those that bookend it, first
of all Snow tells the story of her own marriage to Prince Charming and how
she sought revenge on the seven dwarves who had kept her captive over many
years. These are not the Happy and Bashful variant of dwarf. No, these
dwarves slink up from the kingdom under the ground and act out their depraved
fantasies on unlucky and unsuspecting maidens. Through this story we see a
little of the steely core that has formed the Snow of the <em>Fables</em>
universe and see the cracks forming in her ever stormy relationship with
Prince Charming.

	<a

width="110" height="171" /></a>

	Meanwhile the final tale, that of King Cole, is not only a touching story
of the sacrifices made by a king to preserve the lives of his subjects but
also an opportunity to see a deeper side to a character that is only really
allowed space within the main arc to exist as comic relief. I think this is
where this volume’s charm and success lies. It offers an opportunity for
Willingham to not only subvert and reinvent the origins stories of these
familiar characters but also offers a chance for a <em>Fables</em> fan to
further immerse themselves in this world. <em>1001 Nights of Snowfall</em> is
most definitely more than the sum of its parts, just as Fabletown is more
than a motley collection of mostly forgotten about characters from
fairytales.

	With this series in general, and this book in particular, Willingham
offers adaptations and subversions of too familiar characters that cause us
to rethink the assumptions we have made when consuming these stories
elsewhere. Certain key elements remains, Bigby Wolf still huffs and puffs to
blow that house down, but his lifelong quest to become bigger and stronger so
as to avenge the death  of his mother causes us to think back to that oh so
familiar tale of three little piggies and look beyond the one-dimensional
wolf that is presented to us elsewhere. By reimagining these characters and
their stories, by writing origins stories that delve either side of the
conventional narrative scope of these well worn fairy tales, Willingham has
created an adaptation that enhances our readings of the source material and
exists as an engaging and entertaining series in its own right.

	My fellow Graphixians have  focused mainly on adaptation into (or
between) the medium of comics. For my first ‘proper’ post I will be looking
at <em>American Splendor</em> as an example of a comics adaptation into film.
I recently reread ‘The Harvey Pekar Name Story’ from the collection <em>Bob
&amp; Harv's Comics</em>. ‘Bob &amp; Harv’ are artist Robert Crumb and writer
Harvey Pekar, and the story originally appeared in the second issue of
<em>American Splendor</em> in 1977. Each of the four pages in the strip
consists of a strict twelve-panel grid and in each panel Crumb has drawn a
man ‘talking’ to the reader. Between each panel there are only minor
alterations in the man’s body movements and facial expression. The strip is a
masterclass in comics pacing, with subtle changes in the drawings and
ellipses in the speech bubbles giving a sense of the movement of time.
Several panels do not contain dialogue but just show the man staring out of
the page. These act as punctuation in the text, adding pauses and visual
information to the story. <p style="text-align: left;">What struck me on this
particular reading was that the person depicted in the panels, in Crumb's
typical closely hatched style, is not Harvey Pekar. The word balloons contain
information about the 'speaker' that lead us to believe that he is Harvey
Pekar, the writer of <em>American Splendor,</em> such as the biographical
information that his middle name is Lawrence and the fact he married at a
young age and then later divorced, but the images are quite different to how
Crumb draws Pekar in other stories.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pekar-name002-crop.
jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2447 aligncenter" title="The Harvey Pekar
Name Story p2r1"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pekar-name002-crop.
jpg" alt="" width="1001" height="387" /></a></p> <p style="text-align:
left;"> In <em>Alternative Comics: An Emerging Literature</em> Charles
Hatfield noted that the man named ‘Harvey Pekar’ was ‘not to be confused with
the author’ (2005: 45). Harvey is usually depicted as being quite dishevelled
but the character in this strip is clean-shaven and wearing a suit and tie. I
cannot recall any other strip where Pekar is dressed like this. Even taking
into account that dozens of artists have drawn Pekar over the years, the
caricatures usually have a reasonable consistency in how Harvey looks.
However, as Hatfield states ‘’The Harvey Pekar Name Story’ puts paid to the
notion of a singular self’ (2005: 126). The differences in various artist’s
drawings of Pekar allowed enough ambiguity for Harvey’s future wife Joyce
Brabner to be worried about which version of all the Harvey's she had seen in
the comics was going to be waiting for her at the bus station when she
arrived in Cleveland.</p> <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Hustlin.jpg"><img
class="size-medium wp-image-2488 alignright" style="border: 0px;"
title="Hustlin SIdes"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Hustlin-300x212.jpg"
alt="" width="300" height="212" /></a>In ‘Hustlin’ Sides’, the other strip
drawn by Crumb in issue two, Harvey looks more like other drawn versions of
Pekar, with his hunched over walking style, scruffy T-shirt and swept forward
hair. However, Crumb and Pekar further complicate matters by calling this
version of Harvey ‘Jack the Bellboy’. It may be that, in only the second
issue of <em>American Splendor,</em> Crumb had not yet settled on depicting
Harvey as a ‘realistic’ caricature of Pekar, and Pekar himself is not yet
completely comfortable in divulging the details of his job without the use of
a pseudonym for his autobiographical avatar. In the third issue the different
artists seem settled on the Pekar’s physical appearance but he is still not
named in the strips, often referred to as ‘our man’ or ‘our hero’ and once
again as ‘Jack the Bellboy’.

	In 2003, several strips from <em>American Splendor</em> were adapted into
a film, which also contained scenes from the stand-alone graphic memoir
<em>Our Cancer Year</em> written by Pekar and Brabner and drawn by Frank
Stack. The movie was directed by documentary filmmakers Shari Springer Berman
and Robert Pulcini and starred Paul Giamatti as Pekar and Hope Davis as
Brabner. The<em> </em>film plays with the idea of there being no singular
self by having the real-life Pekar and Brabner appear in the film alongside,
and interacting with, the actors. Both Pekar and Giamatti narrate the film’s
voice-over at different times. In one scene the actors are shown attending a
theatre adaptation of the <em>American Splendor</em> comics. On stage the
actors are playing actors playing Giamatti and Davis playing Pekar and
Brabner. The levels of commentary on versions of the self become dizzying.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AS-movie-5.jpg"><img
class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2479" title="AS movie 5"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AS-movie-5-300x187.
jpg" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a>Near the end of the film, while
undergoing treatment for cancer, Pekar has a breakdown and becomes confused
as to whether he is a real person ‘tell me the truth, am I a guy who writes
about himself in a comic book, or am I just a character in that book?’. He
passes out and this scene leads to a version of ‘The Harvey Pekar Name
Story’.  In the film Paul Giamatti talks to the camera but, unlike the comic,
this version looks like Harvey Pekar. At first he is a figure in the
mid-distance and as he walks towards the camera the room appears around him
drawn in a hatched style similar to Crumb’s. In contrast to the comic Harvey
moves around in the frame, the background changes and he walks outside. The
first two pages of the strip are omitted, there is no need to introduce a
character we have spent the last 90 minutes watching, and we jump straight to
Giamatti as Pekar discussing other Harvey Pekars in the telephone directory.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AS-movie-8.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2465" title="AS movie 8"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AS-movie-8-300x187.
jpg" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a>

	The dialogue is almost exactly as in the strip and as Pekar says ‘These
were the other Harvey Pekars’ we see a ghostly vision of the actual Harvey
Pekar walk across the screen behind him. As in the strip we question the
various versions of Pekar presented to us. Both the scene and the strip end
the same way with ‘Harvey Pekar’ in the middle of the frame asking ‘What’s in
a name? Who is Harvey Pekar?’and then staring out at the viewer/reader. The
truth being that, as the many years of <em>American Splendor</em> comics
show, there are countless Harvey Pekars.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I’m not much of a
comics reader, but I do love Jane Austen and have long been interested in
adaptations of her work and her pop-cultural afterlife. So I was delighted
when Peter gave me a copy of Marvel’s <em>Northanger Abbey</em>.

	Adapting Austen is tricky business, because one of the most significant
and beloved features of her work is the ironic voice of the omniscient
narrator. How can that be conveyed in another medium? Film versions generally
give some of the narrator’s best, most iconic lines to characters, as in the
BBC <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, in which Jennifer Ehle delivers the
assertion that “a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want
of a wife.” But typically much of the narrator’s voice is lost, and with it
some of the wit, social commentary, and moral force of the novels.

	Period-correct film and television adaptations of Austen tend to flatten
her novels into romantic costume dramas. They often seem to put (relative)
faithfulness to the source material ahead of exploiting the possibilites of
the medium they’re adapting it into. For this reason, some of the adaptations
I find most satisfying are those that revive the social commentary by
transporting Austen to a new setting or adapting her more freely, like
Patricia Rozema’s <em>Mansfield Park</em> (1999), Amy Heckerling’s
<em>Clueless</em> (1995), or the online series <em><a
title="http://www.lizziebennet.com/" href="http://www.lizziebennet.com/"
target="_blank">The Lizzie Bennet Diaries</a></em> (developed by Hank Green
and Bernie Su), which uses social media like Tumblr and Twitter to elaborate
and comment on the main storyline.

	The cover of Marvel’s <em>Northanger Abbey</em> suggests a romantic
costume drama type of adaptation. So, too, does the choice of Nancy Butler as
the writer. Butler wrote 12 <a
title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signet_Regency_romances"
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signet_Regency_romances"
target="_blank">Signet Regency romances</a>, and the traditional Regency is
arguably a kind of “adaptation” of Austen’s work (and even more, <a
title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgette_Heyer"
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgette_Heyer" target="_blank">Georgette
Heyer’s</a>) into genre romance form. Butler and artist Janet K. Lee's
adaptation is essentially a romantic comedy, focusing on the relationships
among the Morlands, Tilneys and Thorpes: the misadventures of young lovers in
Bath.

	Butler’s introduction describes Northanger Abbey as “Jane Austen on
steroids,” suggesting that its parody of the Gothic strips out the “emotional
underpinnings” of her other novels, leaving only “broad comedy.” Lee’s
somewhat exaggerated, caricatured style reflects a similar view of the story,
and I thought it worked best for the most broadly-drawn characters. John
Thorpe’s big head, for instance, symbolizes his inflated ego; his bullying is
reflected in the way he often looms over female characters or stands with
legs apart, dominating the scene.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Abbey-001.jpeg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2518" title="Abbey 001"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Abbey-001.jpeg"
alt="" width="415" height="482" /></a>

	But the novel is not just a parody of the Gothic: it also provides its
heroine–and its reader–with an education in how to read both novels and other
people. Without the narrator’s commentary, much of this is lost. A little of
the famous “only a novel” speech is incorporated into Catherine’s dialogue,
but this way of including it undercuts its force. If the speech is delivered
by ignorant Catherine rather than the witty narrator, should we take it
seriously? Moreover, if Catherine were wise enough at the start of the story
to recognize that in the novel “the greatest powers of the mind are
displayed,” she would not need the education in reading that <em>Northanger
Abbey</em> the novel and Northanger Abbey the estate give her. This aspect of
the novel isn’t entirely elided, though. Catherine’s gradual understanding of
her misperceptions is still an integral part of the plot, of course, and is
also reflected more subtly in the illustrations. Isabella Thorpe, for
instance, often appears distorted or askew, suggesting that Catherine isn’t
perceiving her clearly.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Abbey-002.jpeg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2521" title="Abbey 002"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Abbey-002.jpeg"
alt="" width="417" height="490" /></a>

	I found this adaptation least successful when it came to considering the
way <em>Northanger Abbey</em> deploys Gothic conventions. Because while
Austen mocks the excesses of the genre, she takes its politics–the tyranny of
the patriarchy, the bullying nature of fathers and brothers–seriously,
showing how they are found not just in spooky European castles but in the
safe English countryside with its roads and newspapers. Catherine may not
find a skeleton at the Abbey, but she is sent home from it unattended when
the General discovers she’s not an heiress. Certainly the physical power and
occasional menace of both John Thorpe and General Tilney are on display:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Abbey-003.jpeg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2523" title="Abbey 003"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Abbey-003.jpeg"
alt="" width="826" height="443" /></a>

	But I found the drawings of Catherine–alternately smirky and pouty, like
the other young women–didn’t convey her fear or humiliation effectively.
There <em>are</em> emotional underpinnings in this novel, but they are mostly
lost in the broadly comic art.

	I enjoyed Marvel’s <em>Northanger Abbey</em>, but like most Austen
adaptations, it’s not a patch on the original. I wish Butler and Lee had
exploited their medium more fully to provide new perspective on Austen’s
novel rather than light entertainment.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Coming of age stories
are as much about the zeitgeist and spirit of place as they are about the age
of the focal character or memoirist. These narratives concern a person’s
transition to adulthood at a particular historical moment, in a particular
place, with the cultural associations of both. Because this moment and place
are always in the past, the “tense” of such stories is intriguing,
simultaneously retrospective and prospective. They look back on a time when a
person was stepping over a threshold into the future. Consequently, although
they purport to capture what was hip, happening, and future-looking in a
moment, such narratives are always already nostalgic.

	Mats Jonsson’s autobiographical comic <em>Hey Princess,</em> puts him
temporally in the indie pop world of the 1990’s and physically in Stockholm’s
Southside. Jonsson is keenly aware of the temporal paradox of his comic
memoir: his representation of himself as “cool” is shadowed by his knowledge
that, even at the time, he was yesterday’s boy. The question at the end of
the book is whether he is willing to realize that and move on, or if he
remains stuck in his temporal bubble. Of course, that question implies that
it is right to move on rather than cling to youth; it is not clear that
Jonsson believes such a thing.

	&nbsp;

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2539" title="image"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-225x300.jpg"
alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>

	Jonsson consistently critiques his past persona’s shallowness and
insubstantiality in <em>Hey Princess</em>, presenting himself as a collection
of cultural associations orbiting a hollow core. Comics are a particularly
effective medium for conveying such metonomies in the way they use labels on
t-shirts and posters and icons to create associations. In this sense, <em>Hey
Princess</em> is similar to Bryan Lee O’Malley’s <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>. Like
O’Malley, Jonsson uses labels to enmesh an obscure (unless we are familiar
with the Swedish pop scene of the 1990s) national media culture in the global
one. Popsicle and Komeda thus get to enter the same orbit as Pulp and Big
Black while simultaneously acheiving cachet as representative Swedish
artists. The title of the book is taken from the name of a song, just like
the title of <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>.

	&nbsp;

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image2.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2541" title="image"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image2-225x300.jpg"
alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>

	Comics like these suggest that metonymic identity is the foundation and
appeal of youth culture, creating tribes based on signs and symbols. Hence,
Mats’ obsession with “indie” girls demonstrates a desire to find a
complementary set of signs and symbols to the ones that he is attached to:
Big Black t-shirts, a certain fringe to the haircut, and turn up jeans. If
this seems shallow, that is Jonsson’s point. <em>Hey Princess</em> reflects
on the shallowness of lifestyle identification through a particular pop
culture moment. Mats might as well be John Travolta in <em>Saturday Night
Fever</em>. That Mats is aware of this fact doesn’t necessarily redeem him.
Indeed, Jonsson teases us with the possibility of his own redemption, playing
on our expectation that he will “see the light” and leave his shallow,
superficial world for the solidity of adulthood.

	But Mats’ has a Peter Pan element to his personality; he feels a strong
pull to remain in indie world, even though time and age are pushing him out.
For instance, when he and a friend go to an “indie” club, a man, perhaps the
club’s bouncer, tells them: “Sorry, but it’s kind of young tonight…one of
them pop-clubs, so you won’t have much fun” (409). When Mats embarks on a
relationship with a 17 year old girl (he is in his mid-twenties), it
highlights his increasingly perverse identification with youth. When
Martina’s friends use a language that alienates him and listen to music that
he doesn’t appreciate, we see that contemporary youth culture is moving
beyond him. Even if Mats wants to stay in the indie world, that world no
longer exists as Mats knew it. Again, Mats is completely conscious of this
fact; he reflects on how a new Pulp song no longer has what it takes to be a
hit.

	The other pillar of the coming of age narrative, besides pop culture
metonymies, is the assumption of sexual identity. <em>Hey Princess</em>
narrates a series of failed relationships, love stories that do not work
because nothing substantial underlies the attraction. We never get much
insight into the girls Mats goes out with, except perhaps for the mentally
disturbed goth girl who threatens suicide. Mats’ narcissism means that he
needs to work out his relationship with himself before he can succeed with
another person.

	At the end of <em>Hey Princess</em>, Jonsson states that he had one eye
on the mirror when entered the indie lifestyle, and that he can’t remember
when he stopped looking at it. The loss of the mirror has two contrasting
meanings. The first, more positive meaning, is that it could mean the loss of
Mats’ narcissism. He is no longer so self-absorbed and self-concerned. The
second, more negative meaning, is that it could mean that Mats has lost all
capacity for self-reflection and has no distance on his personality at all,
ironic or otherwise. The ending is undecidable. We don’t know if Mats’ latest
girlfriend is just a continuation of a series of indie girls or a terminal
point.

	Perhaps the best way to express Jonsson’s relationship to his youth
culture world is through an analysis of his drawing style. Mats Jonsson draws
in a way that looks primitive; his lines are thick and sloppy looking, as if
drawn with a felt marker with a uniform thickness. However, the style might
be called “faux crude” because it is actually highly detailed and
well-proportioned. It gives <em>Hey Princess</em> an indie feel to match
Mats’ enthusiasm for indie music and indie girls. But like many “indie”
products, the comic is more about possessing a particular style rather than
any “independence” from the publishing and music production worlds. This is
not to diminish Jonsson’s accomplishment; his book is after all an assertion
of the significance of style.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Comics seem to come of
age every ten years or so as the art form responds to innovations from its
practitioners. Some might point to the Golden Age of comics in the 1950s as a
the moment when comics came of age; others might harken further back to
George Herriman's Krazy Kat and Ignatz, or the introduction of that cinematic
mouse with the rounded ears; some would ask us to look to the late-sixties
surge of underground comix and there decidedly anti-insitutitional
narratives; still others might point to Art Spiegelman's Maus as the moment
comics came of age as a medium for storytelling. There are no doubt many
meandering and insightful conversations to be had about when exactly comics,
as a medium, came of age.

	All this to say that coming of age is not always dependent on a reading
of the subject. Sometimes, we need to think about how narrative forms, or
design forms, architectures perhaps, come of age in response to the subject
matter or the cultural context in which those architectures find themselves
representing. Making connections between the evolution of a medium and the
cultural evolutions surrounding them seems almost like a moot point. However,
comics are one of the few media often described as responding to their
cultural surroundings. They appear to come of age again and again, getting
connected with multiple forms of other media wherein comics are often cited
as inspiration for stylistic choices and narrative practices. In other words,
we are quick to show how comics are like other media and, most often, we say
that comics are like whatever dominant media are in the cultural conversation
and themselves coming of age.

	When newspapers and Yellow Journalism came of age, The Yellow Kid arrived
fully formed with his witty smocked placard performing the kind of “literary”
critique that drew attention to the dispositions between high and low
journalism. As radio and the cinema began to establish themselves, Herriman’s
Krazy Kat began testing the medium’s response to surrealism and the comedic
syncopations of vaudeville and burlesque. Cinema brought with a more coherent
relationship with its storyboards and animations. The arrival of digital CG
shows us on the brink of yet another linkage between comics architectures and
creative practices of cinematic representation. In short, as other media come
of age, comics seem to respond by also coming of age at the same moment. They
are both inspired by and influence on emerging visual media, in particular.

	Coming of age narratives are ultimately about personal origin stories.
Comics possess an atypical connection to the origin stories that signal both
the architectures and the story-lines of emerging media, which themselves are
searching for their own origin stories or coming of age in the eyes of mass
culture.

	The baseline point here is that comics are embedded in the fabric of
twentieth-century and twenty-first century artistic practice, particularly so
in the veins of the visual media that so dominate our environments. What we
need to do is start critiquing the architectures of comics to see how they
are responding to shifts in formative associations -- the kids aren't reading
the same superman.

	Perhaps the clearest signal that comics are coming of age in, well, a
different age is the way they reveal their foundational architectures through
practice. Instead of dissolving into the tactile and analogue world of the
pen, comics coming of age in a new landscape are dissolving into the
foundational 8-bit square.

alt="20130327-001041.jpg" /></a></center>On the other hand, comics are the
bedrock of new experiments that endeavor to make the old new again, making
comics not into cinema but more like a video game: <blockquote>Project Gamma
features digital comics with embedded audio, which plays as readers browse or
read through. The music and background adapts to both the events in the comic
and the reader's behaviour. The project is an attempt to make reading a more
immersive experience, like being inside a video game, according to Marvel
executives. (<a
href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2013/03/11/marvel-comics-digital.html
?cmp=rss" target="_blank">source</a>)</blockquote> It's telling that comics
seem to come back to their roots in the golden age of radio in order to go
forward and make themselves more akin to video games. We always configure
comics around the cinema but they remain unbound, taking their coming of age
narratives into new forums. Or are they old forms made new by that impetus to
meld media so inherent in comics' text/image coherence?

	Have comics come of age? Nope. Like superman they remain in a perpetual
state of influence and integration. Remaining inert but constantly on the
vanguard of an evolving cultural moment. Comics and the creative
architectures associated with them resist coming of age and at the same time
remain adaptable to and representative of the artistic innovations that mark
the era.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

Comics</em> made the decision to leap into the twenty-first century and
include, gasp!, a gay character.  His name is Kevin Keller, and it was a huge
deal in Riverdale when he was introduced.  Of course, there was predictable
ire from all the places that are predictably ire-laden, but for the most part
Kevin's introduction was pretty positive.*  People were excited to see stogy,
heteronormative Riverdale come of age; growing up in the twenty-first
century, critics praised, requires exactly this sort of openness and
contemporary thinking.

	But was it really such a grand, forward-thinking move?  I've been
rereading those comics this week and thinking about exactly that.  In the
end, Kevin Keller works because he's easily slotted into the existing
heteronormative and strongly patriarchal world view of <em>Archie
Comics</em>.  Kevin Keller isn't there to subvert or question assumptions
about the way Riverdalers see the world; Kevin's there to show middle
Americans from Riverdales-of-the-mind that exist across the US that gay
people aren't scary.  And that's not <em>Archie Comics</em> coming of age;
that's <em>Archie Comics </em>redefining the closet.

	Riverdale is a supremely heteronormative space.  The girls fantasize
about marriage.  The central love triangle of the series is Veronica and
Betty fighting for Archie's admiration.  The only character who doesn't
actively chase a heterosexual romantic relationship, Jughead, is a
misanthropic character who often ends up the butt of the jokes.  Every other
character is paired up heterosexually; like Barbies and Kens, they reify a
particularly dreamy nostalgic version of small-town-America of yore.  When
Kevin Keller is introduced, then, he must fit in to the existing mode of
discourse.  He cannot subvert it.

	Upon Kevin's arrival in <em>Veronica #202</em>, the gag is a pretty tired
one: Veronica falls for a guy who doesn't fall for her!  But she doesn't know
why!  I mean, he's like all the other guys in Riverdale.  He's athletic and
charming and funny.  He loves fast food eating contests and music.  Oh no,
PSYCH, he's totally gay!

alt="" width="654" height="340" /></a>

	Hahahaha oh hilarious.  But you can forgive Veronica for not knowing.
 Kevin is structured as a character to fit neatly into the heteronormative
realities of Riverdale High's 1950s code.  In fact, one of the features that
save Kevin from potentially bullying is that he, like all young men in
Riverdale, is a strong athlete.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sporty.png"><img
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2606" title="sporty"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sporty.png" alt=""
width="624" height="884" /></a>

	Kevin has to earn his place in Riverdale High society as do the other
boys; he has to demonstrate physical supremacy.  This insulates Kevin from
the potentially bullying that we see framing this scene.  The other guys want
to mock him on the grounds that gay = effeminate.  But they can't, because
Kevin isn't a gender-bending character here to reshape the boxes.  He fits
nicely within those boxes as they exist.

	He's also a well-behaved young man from a military family.  His parents
met and married very young.  His mother stays home and his father was a
Colonel until he was injured in the line of duty.  Kevin is a devoted big
brother to his younger sisters and a committed family man.  Except for the
whole gay thing (maybe because of the nonthreatening overtones!), he's every
parents' dream boyfriend for their daughter.  To have any place at all in
Riverdale, Kevin has to fulfill the ideal.

width="620" height="317" /></a>

	Hahahah oh stupid Mr. Lodge.  Kevin has sex with men!

	The other way Kevin earns his place is that, as a handsome and eligible
young bachelor arriving in town, he offers no threat to the existing romantic
order.  In fact, as Archie points out, having gay guys around is totally
useful for when you don't want to have to do chick stuff, but you don't want
your chick to do stuff with other guys!  In this way, Kevin is not only just
not a subverting force to the role of gender norms in the comic -- he
actively reifies it.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/usefullygay.png"><
img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2610" title="usefullygay"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/usefullygay.png"
alt="" width="403" height="362" /></a>

	I'm totally open-minded and accepting of gay people who are useful to me!

	It's frustrating when such a lauded attempt to normalize the discourse
around gay teenagers falls so far short of what it could be.  But <em>Archie
Comics</em> are constructed within a non-threatening worldview, and Kevin
Keller's characterization is definitely non-threatening.  But this isn't a
coming of age for <em>Archie Comics. </em> Unfortunately, it's just more of
the same.  As <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2013/03/27/109-inspiration-and-
integration-why-comics-cant-come-of-age/">Dave argued last week</a>, comics
remain "inert but constantly on the vanguard of an evolving cultural moment."
 This post takes that argument in another direction, but demonstrates its
truth.

	Footnotes:

	* There was a firestorm of controversy later, however, when in a
flash-forward story arc we see Kevin Keller marry.  Kevin, a product of the
post-DADT American reality, meets his husband-t0-be in the United States
Army.  Among other protests, <a
href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/28/one-million-moms-toys-r-us-
archie-comics_n_1307689.html">One Million Moms responded with a Toys R Us
boycott</a>.  This may further demonstrate that the acceptability of
homosexuality within a heteronormative context like Riverdale has very strict
parameters.  By crossing too many such parameters at once, Kevin went too far
and angered groups, like One Million Moms, that are deeply invested in
traditional, patriarchal notions of the family.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great article. The thrust of your argument, that
Archie remains staunchly conservative as ever relative to American culture,
is something that should not be forgotten in the rush to praise Archie's
publisher for the inclusion of Kevin Keller.

	I do think it's useful to see Archie's Riverdale as a kind of cultural
barometer, albeit one which specifically addresses an inherently conservative
version of American society. The mere fact that a gay character has been
included in Archie's world shows that the 'cultural goalposts' of social
acceptability have shifted to include homosexual people who don't threaten
existing institutions, traditional (patriarchal) gender roles/associations
and normative relationships. Sure Archie represents a regressive world view
but Kevin Keller's mere existence provides evidence that the world at large
has made genuinely progressive strides and such a sign is cause for some
(reserved) celebration at least.]]></wp:comment_content>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[In my longstanding love
of comics, I’ve collected books from across the variously defined “ages,” and
each has its own particular and distinctive feel. The Golden Age, for
example, was rife with morality, nationalism and pedagogy, heavy handed in
these motivations. The Silver Age, by contrast, was predicated on slapstick
and farce, reveling in the fantastic with little concern for continuity or
realism, content just to offer singular stories of heroes that were more
focused on comedy rather than content. The Bronze Age was marked by a moral,
serious turn, with a leaning towards social issues and more realistic images,
both in character representation and in environment.

	What followed, as recent hindsight has made us construct it, was the
invention of the Copper Age, now generally understood to be the early 1990’s,
that saw the advent of Image Comics, variant covers and a new focus on comics
as collectible, physical media. Here comics were marked by landmark,
continuity defining events in single issues and series-within-series (Death
in the Family, X-Cutioner’s Saga, etc.). The age that we are now in is, of
course, as yet undefined, being an age that is always keeping up with the
present moment, always self reflexively on the cutting edge of what comics
are evolving into as the ideal form of the medium. We often forget that ages
are inventions that we ascribe to the past in order to rationalize it, to
trace lines and force patterns where there are often none to be found.

	Defining anything in terms of “coming of age” is always a little
uncomfortable, because it signals a backwards-looking acknowledgement that
there was something juvenile about what preceded the current manifestation,
where something comes into its own enough to be widely recognized for its
validity. Comics, arguably more than any other medium, have been self
consciously doing this from the moment of their inception in their struggle
to be acknowledged as both a legitimate art form and as an appropriate means
of delivering thoughtful narrative to a diverse readership. As critics, we
are forever locked in our present moment when analyzing our texts, but in
looking at the defining characteristics of the various ages of comics, we see
that they “come of age” at least once a generation, becoming always the acme
of what they were meant to be, asymptotically pursuing an ideal form; this
happened previously in Neal Adam’s <em>Green Lantern</em> run, Morrison’s
<em>Arkham Asylum</em>, and now Kirkman’s <em>Walking Dead</em>. The comics
that we are looking at, at any given point in time, are always of the Modern
Age, and because of this it’s difficult to understand them as anything other
than an evolutionary process - particularly now, with the transition to
digital comics, which will undoubtedly mark the coming of age of the next
generation of the medium, full of hyperlinked asides and texts that employ
multimedia in order to broaden their readerships.

	It’s not surprising that a medium that is predominantly used for coming
of age narratives (Spider-man, Batman, Superman, nearly every hero in comics
faces adversity in youth and overcomes it in adulthood) is so
self-consciously trying to redefine itself in whatever age it finds itself
in. It is<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/GREENTEAM_MOVEMENT.
jpg"><img class="wp-image-2628 alignright" title="GREENTEAM_MOVEMENT"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/GREENTEAM_MOVEMENT-
300x230.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="230" /></a> insistent in addressing
the cultural moment faster than any other medium, as we see in Michael
Straczynski’s Spider-Man #36 (an emotional tribute to 9/11, published only a
month after the event), Civil War as it responded to the Patriot Act in the
United States, or even the forthcoming DC series <em>The Green Team</em> and
<em>The Movement</em> that tackle the growing divide between the 99% and our
oligarchs. There is always a need in comics to seem as relevant as possible,
as responsive to readership as any text can be. This may simply be attributed
to marketing, similar to the Victorian serials that would address critics as
individual chapters were published, often adding characters and changing the
structure of the stories in order to sell more copies. The serial does have a
greater potential for change both in form and content, and we see comics
taking advantage of this time and again in addressing the cultural markers of
their eras, whether this is in having Superman tell us to "slap a Jap,"
(Action #58), with having Spider-Man pose on a cover with Barack Obama (ASM
#583),  with Superman employing the help of <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/image1.jpg"><img
class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2627" title="image1"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/image1-231x300.jpg"
alt="" width="231" height="300" /></a>JFK to help protect his secret identity
(Action #309) or with Batman trying to stop the murder of one of the Beatles
(Batman #222).

	Comics is a transgressive medium that is constantly scrabbling after a
validation and an adulthood that will never - appropriately – arrive. Because
it is largely ignored in academic circles and treated as peripheral, it is
forced into the younger brother position alongside the literary canon,
constantly redefining and reasserting itself in its ability to offer more
that its counterparts. However, this is a highly productive
compartmentalization – as comics experiments with facets of its previous
incarnations and struggles for recognition, it does so with a cautionless
abandon that is difficult to see in any other medium. To say that comics have
come of age would be both correct and incorrect; it would perhaps be more
appropriate to say that they have come of <em>this</em> age, and will do so
again and again as each contributor discovers new possibilities for the
medium.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

Everyman</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

	Michel Rabagliati has become one of Quebec’s most famous and well-loved
creators of bandes dessinées. Author of the semi-autobiographical
<em>Paul</em> series, Rabagliati has created a character that has been dubbed
both <a
href="http://www.drawnandquarterly.com/newsList.php?st=art&amp;art=
a3e4e9282482ce">Quebec’s Everyman</a> and the <a
href="http://www.ledevoir.com/culture/livres/245209/paul-est-il-devenu-le-
tintin-du-quebec">Tintin of Quebec</a>. Grandiose these claims may be,
however they certainly demonstrate the dear place that Paul and his
charmingly eccentric family have come to occupy in the hearts and minds of
readers of Québécois Bande Dessinée (BDQ).

	&nbsp;

	Each of the albums in the Paul series takes a distinct period in Paul’s
life and weaves together stories from his present with musings on the lives
and history of his family. Previous topics have included the way in which he
met his wife, his first job as a summer camp counselor and stories from when
he and his wife first moved in together. More recently Rabagliati has tackled
the difficult topic of Paul’s Father in law’s cancer diagnosis and his death
in the touching book <em>Paul à Québec</em>.

	&nbsp;

	<em>Paul à Québec</em> marks a distinct change in both Paul as character
and as series, the often light-hearted tales of Paul’s family and his
childhood become rare as he dwells on the terminal illness of his
Father-in-Law, Roland, and Roland’s life as a young Québécois man in a now
long gone Quebec. By interweaving the tale of Roland’s youth with the story
of his journey towards death, Rabagliati deftly crafted this modern day elegy
that would be translated into English under the title of <em>The Song of
Roland</em>.

	&nbsp;

	This album charts the coming of age of not only the young Roland, but
also of Paul himself, Roland’s daughters and indeed the Paul series as a
whole. Roland’s family are forced to react and grow in ways they had never
thought possible as they live through Roland’s last months, weeks and days.
Paul’s wife Lucie and her two strong willed sisters are pushed to work
together to support their parents and each other and Paul himself is called
to support his wife and sisters in law whilst reflexively musing on the new
Roland that is becoming visible to him through Roland’s increasing
confidences regarding his past. One of the most moving sequences in the book
occurs towards the end where Roland finally says to Paul that he can use the
informal “Tu” when he addresses him rather than the formal “Vous”. Meanwhile,
on the wider level of the series, Rabagliati deftly tackles these difficult
issues and ably demonstrates that this series is not merely the home of light
and self-deprecating familial anecdotes but also a space in which Rabagliati
can address the complexities of life.

	&nbsp;

	<img class="size-full wp-image-2635 aligncenter" title="paul mother
leaving"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/paul-mother-leaving.
png" alt="" width="300" height="206" />

	In the flashback sequences relating to Roland’s youth, we see him as a
young, desperately poor Francophone in the Quebec of the mid twentieth
century. Abandoned by his parents, Roland was taken in by the church and
educated by them until such a point as it became apparent that he would not
be seeking a career within their fold. After a period spent wandering the
streets of Quebec, homeless and unemployed, a chance encounter with a
shopkeeper whose bike he would have stolen leads to employment, and Roland's
English skills see him swiftly promoted within his new employment. Meeting
his wife, starting a family and pursuing a new career, first as a travelling
salesman, then as an employee of a distribution firm all follow in quick
succession and Roland soon finds his feet and goes on to become Executive
Vice President of the distribution firm before his retirement.

	&nbsp;

	This story of a young man forced to grow up all too quickly upon his
parents’ disappearance and his subsequent failures and then successes serves
as a touching counterpoint to Rabagliati’s tale of his illness and the way in
which he soon becomes defined by his status as patient rather than for his
life’s achievements. It is also notable that Roland’s own coming of age runs
in parallel with the period of intense socio-political and economic change
that occurred within the province of Quebec during the 1960s which has come
to be known as The Quiet Revolution. Without ever going into specific
details, these sections do still offer insights into the realities of life
during the 1950s and 1960s within the province.

	&nbsp;

	On the broader level of BDQ it is notable that Paul exists at all.
Previous  iconic figures within BDQ have tended towards the satirical or the
subversive, specific examples include <a
href="http://www.bedetheque.com/album-66073-BD-Le-huron-kebekois.html">
Bojoual le huron kébékois</a> and <a
href="http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/c/capkebec.htm">Capitaine Kébec</a>.
Whilst BDQ is held to have its resurgence in the 1970s, with the so-called
Springtime of Québécois Bande Dessinée, no definitive or iconic character
emerged from these efforts to create a distinctly Québécois incarnation of
the comic book form. Capitaine Kébec may still be used as a poster boy for
BDQ, yet he, with his towel for a cape, cannot be considered of relative
importance to BDQ as characters such as Tintin and Asterix are to
Franco-Belgian BD. What Paul has given BDQ is their own figurehead, a
character that stands as representative of BDQ as a distinctive comic book
form. As David argued a few weeks ago comics might not ever come of age, but
what <em>Paul</em> demonstrates is that BDQ has matured to the point where it
is able to produce and sustain an iconic figurehead that is distinctly its
own, similar to Tintin only in looks and the regard in which he is held.

	&nbsp;

src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/PaulQuebecIweb2.jpg"
alt="" width="226" height="310" />

	<em>Paul à Québec </em> not only documents the coming of age of its
characters, but it also offers a glimpse of the intense changes that have
marked the development of Quebec’s society and politics over the last 60
years. For Rabagliati and <em>Paul</em> as a series, this book demonstrated a
distinct shift in tone and content, the series itself came of age and offered
exciting and moving new riches to its readers while Paul as character stands
as testament to a more confident BDQ that seeks to innovate rather than
appropriate and subvert.

<title>#113 What Will It Take To Seduce You? - Coming of Age in Geneviève
Castrée&#039;s Susceptible</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[As the least Canadian
member of the Graphixia crew (being neither a national nor studying there) I
felt it was about time that I came of age by writing about a Canadian comic
about coming of age. I have been waiting eight years to read another work by
Geneviève Castrée and last month I was finally able to get my hands on
<em>Susceptible,</em> her latest book and a memoir about her childhood in
Québec.

	I first came across Castrée’s work in <em>Drawn &amp; Quarterly
Showcase</em> in 2005. Each issue showcased three up-and-coming artists and
Castrée was featured in issue three, alongside strips by Sammy Harkham and
Matt Broersma. In the credits she is listed as Geneviève Elverum, her married
name which she appears to have used only briefly.

	I initially picked up the book because I was fascinated by Castrée’s
attractive and distinctive artwork on the cover. Inside, her dreamlike story
‘We’re Wolf!” begins as a meditation on depression before moving on to
thoughts about love and our place in the world. It was the art that struck me
first however, with meticulously detailed illustrations in fine-nibbed pen,
and ink wash. There are rarely panel borders and often one image fills the
whole page. Each page may have hundreds of tiny marks on it but it never
looks cluttered, this is a strip that always feels spacious and delicate,
both in illustration style and emotion. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sus003.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2648" title="sus003"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sus003.jpg" alt=""
width="902" height="410" /></a></p> The strip opens with a depressed girl
reading a comic in bed, the book looks a lot like <em>Tintin in Tibet.</em>
Later the pages blossom into life as she meets a boy riding the elephant that
was originally a manifestation of her depression. They leave the elephant
behind and climb into a snowy mountain landscape. The clear deliberate line
work also brings to mind Hergé’s Himalayan adventure. Both characters
resemble Castrée, creating a feeling that this work stems from autobiography.

	A double page spread blooms into bright colour and features the two
characters surrounded by an intricate pattern of green leaf covered branches.
In bright red circles in the corners of these pages Castrée writes, “What
will it take to seduce you?” but the question is immaterial, I am already
smitten.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sus001.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2652" title="sus001"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sus001-1024x697.jpg"
alt="" width="1024" height="697" /></a>

	Despite falling for her work in a big way I found other books hard to
obtain here in the UK. Castrée has released a few books with Montreal based
publisher L'Oie de Cravan including book/LP packages. She also recorded
drone/folk/pop music under the name Woelv and more recently, Ô Paon, and has
stated that both drawing and music are forms of meditation to her. When I
began to see the pre-publicity for <em>Susceptible</em> I was very excited
but there was also a slight feeling of trepidation, what if the long wait had
built my expectations up too high?

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sus006.jpg"><img
class="size-medium wp-image-2663 alignright" title="sus006"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sus006-205x300.jpg"
alt="" width="205" height="300" /></a>I need not have worried;
<em>Susceptible</em> is a beautiful book drawn from a childhood and
adolescence filled with wonder and pain, and darkness and light. A coming of
age story where the need to break free of one’s upbringing is imperative. As
Castrée says at the end “I’m eighteen. I have all my teeth. I can do what
ever I want”

	The book begins with Castrée (or Goglu as her character is named in the
book) as a naked baby on an almost empty page. The narration is in Castrée’s
characteristic neat yet intricate cursive text and discusses the topic of
nature versus nurture. As Goglu grows older a plant beside her grows too, and
as she ponders her depressive nature the plant slowly begins to entrap her.
She struggles and eventually breaks free, we see her curled up and clothed
and the text says “I have pulled myself so far away from my family that it is
almost like I don’t belong to it anymore”. These four pages lay out themes of
the book common to other coming of age stories; the feeling of being trapped
by family, attempting to find one’s sense of self, and the desire to fly the
nest.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sus0041.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2657" title="sus004"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sus0041.jpg" alt=""
width="699" height="434" /></a>

	<em>Susceptible</em> details Goglu’s life until the age of 18, she lives
with her mother Amère and her partner Amer. Everyone in the book is given a
pseudonym and on initial reading I didn’t realise that these names translated
as ‘bitter’ but that certainly describes these two. Amère was the youngest of
16 siblings and appears not to be able to handle being single. She is the
opposite of Goglu who craves silence and solitude.

	Goglu’s father Tête d'Oeuf (great name!) left when she was two years old
to go live at the other end of Canada in British Columbia “a mythical kingdom
where dads go to disappear”. There is a very atmospheric double page spread
as Goglu watches him leave from a second floor window. Outside it is night
and raining heavily, and the only illumination is from the headlight of Tête
d'Oeuf’s motorbike. Castrée draws precipitation beautifully.

	In the Comics Journal Harvey Pekar described Robert Crumb as having “a
cartoony style, but his work, because of its wealth of accurately observed
detail, is also realistic”, the same can be said about Castrée’s artwork.
Clothes are meticulously striped or checked, furniture is painstakingly
patterned and vehicles are realistically rendered.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sus0051.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2656" title="sus005"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sus0051.jpg" alt=""
width="903" height="479" /></a>

	When she is 15 Goglu visits her father for the first time in 10 years and
she begins to experience the freedom and space that she has been craving “I
discover true solitude and I savour it”. The book touches on her experiences
with drugs, sex and music as she begins to find her way in the world and
moves towards the inevitable break from her mother. Amère makes a last
attempt to stop Goglu leaving by suggesting they get an apartment together
and when Goglu refuses she tries to make her feel guilty “well… you’ve
abandoned me…”. Goglu can take no more and floats out of her shoes and
through a hole in the white space of the page.

	In interviews Castrée has admitted to a problem that faces all
autobiographical cartoonists, how do people feel about being depicted in the
book? She confesses that the comic may upset her mother “I have this magical
power to break my mom's heart”. Despite this and perhaps because she has not
spoken to her mother for several years, Castrée felt that this was a story
she had to draw. I am very grateful that she did.

Warren Craghead</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[“In life, the visible
surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many marvels he
presents. Almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and re-crossed
with numberless straight marks in thick array, something like those of the
finest Italian line engreavings….In some instances, to the quick, observant
eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but afford the ground
for far other delineations.” Herman Melville, <em>Moby Dick</em>

	In spite of a general effort to celebrate the visual aspect of comics as
being their key feature, artists get the short end of the stick in mainstream
commercial comics. Writers like Alan Moore, Ed Brubaker, and Neil Gaiman get
lionized, while artists are celebrated, yes, but more as an accessory to the
concepts of the “author”. Independent comics tend to celebrate the auteur:
the complete artist who generates images in perfect harmony with his or her
ideas. Pick your Hernandez brother. Or Jason. But even in these cases,
<em>logos</em> tends to override image. See <a
href="http://www.tcj.com/giftsfrombeto/">Charles Hatfield’s latest review of
Gilbert Hernandez’ <em>Julio’s Day</em> and <em>Marble Season</em></a>. If
you didn’t know Hernandez was a comics artist and didn’t see the images
associated with the review, then it would take you a while to figure out that
there was a visual dimension of the work. This is not to criticize Hatfield,
who is one of the most skilled critics of comics. I just want to draw
attention to the conceptual dominance of ‘story’ over picture in the
discussion.

	While I admit to painting an overly simple picture here, it gives rise to
the question of how certain comics artists who put drawing before
storytelling challenge the notion that comics must tell a story supported by
pictures. What if the picture came first, and the story came second? Arising
from the image as it were, rather than preceding it?

	These are the kinds of questions that <a title="http://www.craghead.com/"
href="http://www.craghead.com/" target="_blank">Warren Craghead</a> asks.
Craghead talks about his own work as trying to avoid the “cinematic” aspect
of more mainstream comics, the feeling that one is looking through windows or
frames at an unfolding story. Instead, he wants his drawings to come out at
the viewer…to be objects in the world. To Craghead, a drawing is both a thing
and a picture of a thing. The way I understand his work is to think of it as
a perpetual questioning of what it means to draw a picture of something,
incorporating a complex of mind, hand, technology, and external world.

	<a

tumblr_mlvp92uXFL1s33sk0o1_1280.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium

tumblr_mlvp92uXFL1s33sk0o1_1280-198x300.jpg" alt="" width="198" height="300"
/></a>

	Craghead trained as a painter but has become a compulsive “pencil hound,”
someone who draws habitually, experimentally, and humorously in search of the
narratives that his art might generate rather than illustrate. That is, his
drawings reach for something that he hasn’t yet thought of, even though they
are frequently referential: you can spot dogs, surfers and formula one cars
but also strange lines and shapes that you can’t identify.

	For instance, Craghead draws while driving (always paying attention to
the road, he says), while watching television with his daughters, whenever he
gets the chance, just to see what happens. One of his projects is to draw
comics on Post-it notes and leave them stuck in various places in his world.
Similarly, with <em>Seed Toss</em> Craghead sends drawings out into the world
to see what happens to them. Maybe one will take root and grow while the
others that shrivel up and become nothing. The exciting thing for Craghead is
not knowing: each drawing is a lottery ticket, potentially with the right
combination of numbers.

/></a>

	In our discussion with Craghead and Simon Moreton in our <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ3AY3KFDWA&amp;feature=c4-feed-u">
Graphixia podcast</a>, I asked what the connection was between their work:
because <a href="http://www.tcj.com/minicomics-of-note/">Rob Clough in his
Comics Journal piece on Moreton’s <em>Smoo</em> comics</a> said that they
reminded him of Craghead’s work, but I couldn’t see the relationship.
Moreton’s comics seem to be the careful distillation of things, every lamp
post in the street refined to an economy of line so as to require nothing
more. Craghead’s comics, in contrast, look more like mad scribbling, as if
there were not enough time to worry about the kind of refinement we see in
Moreton’s work. This stop light only allows so much time for a drawing:
better get it down as quickly as possible. You get the feeling that to slow
down for Craghead would be to risk missing something. This feeling I have may
just be an illusion. For all I know, Craghead agonizes over every mark and
gesture.

	The real connection between the two artists is that each is coming at the
question of what it means to draw a picture of something from a different
angle. In the podcast, both artists talked about memory, place, and searching
for something while not quite knowing what it is. In Moreton’s work, these
terms create perhaps a mistaken sense of nostalgia; he’s not trying to
capture the past or present it through rose coloured glasses, but to look for
something in it that he can’t quite figure out. The urgency in Craghead’s
work has the same effect, of tying to express something in the reaction
between brain and manifest world with the movement of a pencil.

	Ultimately, Moreton and Craghead have a Romantic sense of what it means
to draw a picture of something: what matters is not so much the
verisimilitude in the representation of the thing as what the representation
expresses about the artist’s mind in response to the
thing.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great article, and one that really got me
thinking.

	I think you capture (once again) what I'm trying to get at it in my own
comics perfectly. In particular, where you suggest that in drawing "not
trying to capture the past or present it through rose coloured glasses, but
to look for something in it that [I] can’t quite figure out" I thought you
nailed it in a way that I hadn't been able to before. It also made me
thinking of 'Once in a Lifetime' by Talking Heads, which other than being a
favourite song of mine, evokes a sort of biographical bewilderment, set
against the indifference and beauty of the world. I think it pretty much sums
up the question I'm always asking of myself in my comics: 'how did I get
here?'.

	This comment makes me reflect on Warren's words about my approach to
memoir. I've never been interested in doing 'straight' autobiography, that is
'this happened then this happened then I went there'. Rather I'm interested
in the feeling of an event, or the affect of a place or time in my life. I
think I see that in Warren's work, too, but perhaps I'm projecting.

	Drawing in the way that I helps me ask this question because it allows me
to explore affects and atmospheres. I never fail to be astonished when
someone can get what I'm getting at in so few lines. A workmate of my
girlfriend saw my new 'holiday' zine and apparently (I wasn't there at the
time) was totally taken with how the lines evoked  all the feelings I was
hoping they'd evoke. It's really, really humbling.

	Reflecting on these thoughts, and the joy I take when people relate to my
comic, there's something else I realise now, about my own work,  which is to
do with the format it takes usually (the zine) and its relationship to the
reader

	I want to tell stories about the world that people can relate to, and
from whom I can learn in return. I like that the medium of comics can be used
to that. I think I'm pretty traditional in that respect - I'm interested in
the beat of the panels, the composition etc. a way to deliver oblique ideas.
So the material artefact of the zine is important to me for that reason.

	So perhaps my adherence to a traditional narrative is what sets us apart?
Not to say that Warren's comics don't seek to tell stories - 'Thickets', one
of my favourite pieces of his, is a beautiful, complex ode to a
neighbourhood- but that their immediacy and methods of doing so play out in a
different way

	Warren's drawings succeed so beautifully because it is the drawing itself
that lives, the echo of his hand and pencil, and the enigmatic assemblages
that emerge so wonderfully from there. And it's the inventiveness of Warren's
drawing that keeps me coming back and that makes me want to engage and learn
from his work.]]></wp:comment_content>

pretence, it inevitably leads us to definitions. Definitions, by most
practices, work through histories or precedences to scope out the variables
and juxtapositions required to be precise about what it is one means. That
nod to history—either acknowledgement of, or reaction to—is the first and
most important factor in determining a definition for art that might serve a
discussion of comics and their relationship to art (or Art).

	To this definition, I bring the most recent incarnation of
<em>Hawkeye</em>. Written by Matt Fraction and drawn by David Aja,
<em>Haweye</em> takes up the character first put out there by Stan Lee in
<em>Tales of Suspense</em> 57 in 1964. <em>Hawkeye</em> has most recently
been spotted in the <em>Avengers</em> movie and a brief cameo appearance in
<em>Thor</em>. The point here is not to show that <em>Hawkeye</em> has been
around a while or is still relevant, but to establish that the subject itself
is not new. That distinction is an important one since what defines something
is often difference—think Stan Lee’s characters as different than DC’s
characters or the early nineties turn marked by Todd McFarlane’s work on
<em>Spiderman</em> and <em>Spawn</em>. That said, what needs to be resisted
at all costs in a discussion about comics and art is a comparison to
something we might refer to as institutional art — think pictures of the
naked Madonna with child or giant waterlilies or pastiche or blurry colours
or Art Speigleman (I know that mention will kill him, but when you have
travelling gallery shows, that’s saying something). Instead, we must first
confront the work on its own terms within its own context. To this extent,
<em>Hawkeye</em> is art.

	But what kind of art is it and how does it stand in relation to what we
might call Art (intentional Speigleman pun there)? Aja references the history
of comic art in a number of ways, but most relevant here are his
allusions—primarily visual—to the work of Chris Ware. Ware has a
characteristic style that alludes to his own sense of aesthetics— a set of
principles that govern what he takes to be a worthwhile expression. He
favours the intricate and the intimate; tends to treat the page as if it were
a building or container for the representation of detached, dejected lives;
focuses on expressive representations of the body with a slow, developing
narrative, that emphasizes the minute spaces between motions. A few
representative examples appear below. <p style="text-align: center;"><a

src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ware_building.jpg"
alt="" width="277" height="368" /></a></p> Enter into this conversation
<em>Hawkeye</em>. Aja captures Ware’s sense of the page, with its
intersecting lines and narratives. The allusion is entirely clear to someone
who has a knowledge of Ware’s work. The close-ups on the face, the
slow-moving minutae of the body, the built-up page (in fact, the whole story
in this issue takes place in Clint’s (Hawkeye’s) building. <p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/hawkeye_character.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2698" title="hawkeye_character"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/hawkeye_character.jpg
" alt="" width="277" height="368" /></a></p> <p style="text-align:

href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/hawkeye_ware.jpg"><
img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2700" title="hawkeye_ware"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/hawkeye_ware.jpg"
alt="" width="277" height="368" /></a></p> This allusionary context is a
marker for defining a developing, emerging, or established aesthetic. Ware’s
style is being translated into another storyline through allusion both subtle
and apparent—an institution, we’ll call it the Institution of Ware, is
establishing itself. In fact, Aja may be playing on the pun of "cutting" the
cords with a mentor, bringing the sometimes antagonistic relationship between
practice and principle, hereditary and innovative into play. Seems simple
enough: hang a picture by Aja from <em>Hawkeye</em> next to a page by Ware
and boom, there you have it—Art and an aesthetic style to accompany it.

	That said, there are conflicting analytical principles at play here. The
first is that Chris Ware writes and draws his work entirely whereas
<em>Hawkeye</em> is a collaborative effort. In other words, we need to ask
what part of the comic is art exactly? Is it the the writing, the drawing,
the colouring, the text? Each of these functions has a distinct personality
behind it. Moreover, the drawings by Aja certainly allude to Ware’s work, but
then so does the colour-scheme.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ware_colours.jpg"><
img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2701" title="ware_colours"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ware_colours.jpg"
alt="" width="768" height="1024" /></a>

	Note how Matt Hollingsworth mimics the style of these colour-schemes in
<em>Hawkeye</em>, emphasizing the subtle variations in hue and tone, even the
presence of red (see the early <em>Hawkeye</em> pages above and Clint's red
hat).

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/hawkeye_ware_colours
.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2702"
title="hawkeye_ware_colours"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/hawkeye_ware_colours.
jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024" /></a>

	Is Aja guiding Hollingsworth and how does a collaborative effort stand in
relation to a single-authored piece? Does Chris Eliopoulos not deserve credit
for his fine lettering given the attention often given in aesthetics about
typography and the designs for representing the word? In short, comics bring
tough questions to bear on traditional concepts governing the definition of
artistic practice and its accompanying aesthetic philosophies.

	Fact is, the question of comics’ relation to art is a moot one. It’s
already over before it began. We’ll never know what the relationship is
because we don’t really need to. It’s a fruitless exercise at this point; the
history of comics is established enough that comics can be discussed within
their own context in relationship to nothing but themselves. To open up that
discussion, connecting <em>Hawkeye</em>’s covers with the work of Jasper
Johns for instance, only dilutes the conversation we might be having about
comics.

	<a

alt="" width="768" height="1024" /></a>

	Comics stand in relation to art like the internal combustion engine
stands in relation to the steam engine: they may well be andecendants, but to
think of them in this way does nothing to help us understand either. That
comics are often a collaborative, usually repetitive, almost always recycled
endeavour opens spaces for new conversations about the nature of the medium.
These conversations must occur outside the already established aesthetic
principles of artistic production in precisely the same way that a discussion
of the steam engine must stand outside a discussion of an internal combustion
engine. Comics are a multi-mediated and re-mediated form of practice and
cultural production that can only be defined within its own contexts—a
context that more than justifies its significance as the most relevant form
of twenty-first century aesthetic practice—and that means it can’t be art or
Art… or, mercifully, stand in relation to either.

		<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[My favourite
		comic artists these days: Simone Lia; Brian Lee O'Malley; Chester
		Brown; Jeff Lemire; Sarah Leavitt.  In webcomics I love <a
		href="http://harkavagrant.com">Kate Beaton</a>; <a
		href="http://xkcd.com">xkcd</a>; <a
		href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php">Dinosaur Comics</a>.  These
		are the artists and authors of the books I return to over and over
		again.  Primarily line-based, these comics are more about simple,
		evocative line art than about the kind of full-colour, high detail
		comics I used to covet.  The shift has been a marked one: I've gone
		from privileging the kind of sweeping epic imagery more common to
		big-2 comic series like <em>Marvel Civil War</em> and DC's
		<em>52</em> to a much more sparse, line-drawn style that is more
		typical of my readerly transition to slice-of-life graphic
		narratives.  As <a
		href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2011/11/21/49-really-awesome-art
		-and-not-thinking-like-an-english-person/">I talked about a long long
		long time ago</a> (issue 47!), I've been trying to privilege art over
		writing.  And while I'd like to suggest that I've developed a kind of
		subtlety and delicacy in my reading of imagery -- that I now look for
		these simpler art forms because I can read more into them than I did
		before -- I think maybe that's not so.

	Many of the slice-of-life and autobiographical narratives I gravitate
towards use more simplicity in the imagery than more traditional superhero
comics.  They make extensive use of blank space and rarely use colour.  Lines
are spare; explressions are subtle and nuanced.  I can read a lot in a single
panel of, for example, Sarah Leavitt's <em>Tangles</em>.

	<a
href="http://robynreads.ca/editor/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tangles-3.jpg"><
img class="alignnone"
src="http://robynreads.ca/editor/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tangles-3.jpg"
alt="" width="660" height="300" /></a>

	God, so few lines but so much is evocative.  This comes at the moment in
the text when the narrator realizes that her mother is not all there -- this
embrace, with the empty faces and the simply figures, suggests the absence
that will soon be replaced by the knowledge of Alzheimer's and the
progressive deterioration of the mother.  The images blur here: which is the
mother and which is the daughter?  Who is being held?  It's not clear.  Both
characters are scared and anxious; both are lost as they await news.  And
furthermore, this image illustrates an underlying anxiety in the comic that
Sarah is her mother -- that their physical similarity will result in her also
developing Alzheimer's, that she cannot escape this fate because they are one
and the same.

	I feel pretty darn chuffed with myself for getting so much from a single
image.  I'm awesome!

	But I'm consciously choosing texts that force me to do this -- that offer
up empty space ripe for analysis -- that ask me to put the pieces together.
 Am I really thinking less like an English Lit person, or am I simply finding
texts that make it so I have a lot to "read" in the imagery and that invite
me to do the kind of work I feel comfortable with?  Because when I read a
representative sample of <em>Marvel Civil War</em>, I excuse myself from any
cognitive work in looking at the images.

	<a

"><img class="alignnone"
src="http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/files/original/civilwar-finale.jpg"
alt="" width="425" height="402" /></a>

	Why?  Have I made some distinction between high and low comics -- those
"literary" enough for visual analysis and those not?  I suspect that that's
exactly what I'm doing, and perhaps it's not entirely unreasonable and
undeserved, but it requires that I question my understanding of how to read a
comic.  I'm going to start trying to apply some of the skills I've built on
my slice-of-life comics to more traditional superhero narratives.

	I'm starting to learn that the art of reading comics is a
process.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

	1 Music a short composition of a romantic nature, typically for piano. 2
Art a picture of a night scene.

	Before you start reading this, please do me a favour and put your
headphones in and press play on the Youtube playlist below. All will become
clear as the post progresses and if I ever meet you I might even buy you a
gin for putting up with my nonsense.

	<iframe

kfgeM00z5su59yrfK3G" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe>

	I am currently doing some fieldwork in the Bibliothèque et Archives
Nationale du Québec (bear with me, I will get on to comics and art in a
minute), and part of this involves reading a lot of comics, magazines, books
and zines produced in Québec from 1976(ish) to the present day. Some <span
style="text-align: center;">of these have been brilliant, the magazine Croc
for instance; is something I would like to return to in a future Graphixia
posting. The Neverendum Colouring Book made me laugh a little bit. However
there have been some low points as well. A particular low point came just
last week when during two days in the library six out of the seven texts I
requested from the stacks included some of the ugliest art work I have ever
seen.</span>

	And so, I turned to one of my favourite creators, Pascale Blanchet.
Blanchet is an illustrator and comic book creator from Trois-Rivieres in
Québec. Having worked as a professional illustrator his first comic was
released in 2005. Blanchet’s work is that which I turn to when people I meet
scoff at the idea that comics might be art (fortunately few and far between).
Other than Michel Rabagliati he is also my most oft- recommended creator to
those asking me questions about BDQ. His work might not have the edge and
audacity of Julie Doucet’s oeuvre, nor the sketchy charms of Jimmy Beaulieu’s
autobiographical comics, however his refined and elegant stories deftly
transport you back in time and immerse you in a world of romance, swirling
snow storms and stirring music. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/baloneyblanchet.jpg"
><img class="size-full wp-image-2766 aligncenter" title="baloneyblanchet"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/baloneyblanchet.jpg"
alt="" width="666" height="353" /></a></p> &nbsp;

	Blanchet holds that his inspiration comes primarily from music, and it is
for this reason that at the end of each book he includes a discography for
the reader (“Aha!”*. See what I did there?). The music reflects the themes
and subject matter of his book and listening to the music as you read the
books creates an immersive experience that cannot help but transport you to
the time and place of each book. For example ‘La Fugue’ is soundtracked by
jazz classics, and ‘Rapide Blanc’ by the music of big band stars such as
Artie Shaw, The Andrews Sisters and Bing Crosby, 'Nocturne's' soundtrack?
Well you're listening to it now (I hope).

	‘Nocturne’  tells the story of three lives, intertwined only through the
music performed by one of the characters. The words of Cole Porter’s classic,
‘In The Still of the Night’ flow through the opening pages of the book as we
meet their singer the beautiful, aloof and mysterious Anne Schaeffer. As we
follow the words through the pages we meet first an unnamed author who has
just received a letter of rejection for his manuscript and second a
distracted waitress in a diner, Molly. The three never meet but their stories
are brought together within the pages of ‘Nocturne’. We soon realize that for
Anne’s all is not quite as perfect as it seems. Meanwhile the author argues
with his girlfriend and the Molly receives shocking news from home.

	New York operates as another character within the pages of this book.
However Blanchet has created a version of New York that belongs in a Woody
Allen film or an Edward Hopper painting. Its dramatic skyscrapers dwarf Anne
as she emerges from work, overwhelmed by her life. As the writer argues with
his girlfriend on the banks of the Hudson the rain lashes down around them,
and a storm batters the Greyhound bus in which Molly is rushing home. By
choosing characters that seem like cultural archetypes, the beautiful
waitress, struggling writer and weary artists, Blanchet only emphasizes the
unreality of his tale. His art, story and soundtrack all work together to
bring to life a New York that is cinematic, beautiful and soul destroying.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-Shot-2013-05-
28-at-19.14.391.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2764" title="Screen
Shot 2013-05-28 at 19.14.39"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-Shot-2013-05-
28-at-19.14.391.png" alt="" width="673" height="374" /></a>

	Practically wordless, Blanchet lets his art drive the narrative forward.
His art is deceptive in its simplicity, single or double page spreads are
Blanchet’s standard format, and this large format allows the reader to savour
the artwork and the beautiful details that Blanchet scatters through his
pages. The occasional blank page paces the reader, forcing them to absorb
details, such as the woven texture that can be seen underneath every image or
the beautiful shadows that fall across the page. Almost all of the words in
this book do not belong to the story; they are timetables and song lyrics,
rejection letters from publishers and the perpetually chirpy commentary of
radio DJs. His work is created either using Adobe Illustrator or Linocuts and
calls to mind mid-century American art and design, and modernist works
created by artists such as Lili Tschudi or Cyril E Power.

	Whilst Blanchet claims not to look at the work of other illustrators, he
would find it too intimidating <a title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>, he also
holds that the largest influence on him, creatively, were the record sleeves
he remembers from his childhood. It is certainly true that Blanchet’s books
are reminiscent of the work of Jim Flora who designed multiple album covers
in the 1940s and 1950s.

	<img class=" wp-image-2760 alignright" title="Jim Flora - The Panic is
On"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/album-graphixia-
300x300.png" alt="" width="180" height="180" />

	The limited colour palette that he chooses for each album, in this case
teal, gray, orange and black further reinforces the cinematic backdrop of New
York and as more colours are added to his palette in the last few pages of
the book, Anne and Molly’s renewed lease on life is subtly underscored.

	Blanchet’s comic pushes the reader to muse on what it means to be a
successful artist. Anne Schaeffer is renowned and successful, yet she is
clearly deeply unhappy. Meanwhile his author is unsuccessful to the point
that publishers are recommending he follow another career in their letters to
him. Come the morning Anne leaves her home and walks out on her life in
search of a new one while the writer sits himself down at his typewriter and
starts again. Blanchet’s nocturne questions ideas of art and the artist, fame
and success and pushes into sharp relief the reality of New York in
comparison with the idealized version so often seen elsewhere.

	Evidence of Blanchet’s own uncertain relationship with art is evident in
his reproduction of artworks within the text. Where buildings are lovingly
copied on the page, when it comes to recreating the statues and paintings
that Anne passes on her way home Blanchet is less particular. Rather figures
within artworks are loosely rendered, fading away at their extremities, often
suggested rather than represented in the detailed way that Blanchet presents
architecture. This does perhaps demonstrate the feelings of intimidation that
Blanchet has admitted to. That is not to suggest that his style is in any way
photorealistic elsewhere, it has however a certain sharpness and precision
that is absent in his rendering of objects such as the sculptures on the Art
Deco façade of the NBC building in New York.

	It would be easy to discuss Blanchet’s comics as art as you could
probably take any single page from one of his books and hang it on your wall.
But when I think about comics and art what comes to mind aren’t questions
about artwork but rather musings on the relationships that exist between
comics and other artforms. Other examples of this might include the way in
which Eric Simon and Simon Bossé used the inspiration of Hubert Aquin’s
‘Prochain Episode’ to create ‘Hamidou Diop’ a comic that draws heavily on the
tradition of Emblem Books. Or the way in which Julie Doucet joined forces
with Michel Gondry to create ‘My New New York Diary’ a comic book and short
film combination. Pascal Blanchet uses music to shape and guide not only his
art but also his narratives, all the while forging a different and exciting
kind of relationship between Comics and Art, which in this particular
instance seems to perfectly unite both the musical and artistic aspects of
the definition of the word nocturne.

196x300.jpg" alt="" width="196" height="300" /></a>Referring to comics as
“art” has long been problematic for a host of reasons – their mass
production, their varied content and audience level, their lateness in
arriving to the literary field and the canonical “Arts” on the whole. Most
challenging to overcome, however, is the marriage of text and image that
comics represents, and it’s a far more complicated dynamic than any other
medium has faced. Comics are often compared to film because of the similar
interplay between words and images, though the challenges that comics are
actually wholly different: in film, the audience is presented with visuality
and aurality, whereas in comics, the reader is presented with competing
visualities, with text and image consistently attempting to usurp one another
for dominance in delivering the narrative. This creates a sort of cognitive
dissonance on the part of the reader, unsure of where the artistry in comics
truly lies and unsure of how to engage with the art object itself.

	We see this tension erupt in a number of different ways in comics,
notably in such conventions as the splash panel, where text is typically
silenced (or kept to a noticeable minimum) in order to have a full page image
supplant the dual pull on our attention. Here, we are offered a brief moment
where we can access the art object in the conventional way, in that we are
allowed to provide the context for ourselves. Images naturally beget a
textual response in our minds as we mull them over, bringing our experiences
and personal histories to bear on them despite the environment in which
they’re encountered. With the presence of text, we are denied this natural
response, interrupted in our efforts by the constant push and pull between
author and artist, between allowing the images to naturally form cognitive
responses and allowing the text to do the exact opposite.

.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="335" /></a>Reading comics is challenging
because it causes us to fuse these binaries, making the experience multiple
in ways we are rarely cognizant of. As Scott McCloud notes, there is a
“visual vocabulary” in comics (and indeed in all art) that makes us react to
images in particular ways and draw unconscious associations from them, and
the apprehension that we feel when this internalized vocabulary encounters
the printed word can be palpable. The appropriately named “virgin cover” - an
oft employed convention in long running serials where all text (title,
author, even UPC code) is removed in order to solely let the image speak for
itself - is another example of comics’ way of acknowledging the tension
between text and image, forcing the reader to frame the image himself without
the aid of any authorial description. Alex Ross’ painted variant virgin cover
for Star Wars #1 demonstrates the power that an image can take on when
denuded of all of the details of publisher, artist name, even price when
trying to engage comics as art. Compare it then, side by side, with its
counterpart, fettered with titles, tagline and publication details. Which
cover, pictured left and right, more closely represents that ambiguous term
“art”?

src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dawn1-194x300.jpg"
alt="" width="194" height="300" /></a>An example of this relationship can be
further seen in Joseph Michael Linsner’s several “Dawn” miniseries, in which
each panel is painstakingly hand painted despite the advent of technologies
that could do the work for him. If the big A “Art” could be found anywhere in
comics it is here, as Linsner rehashes religious themes mixed with fantasy
and myth, drawing inspiration from Franzetta in alternating between pastels
and oils and providing rich imagery to accompany his text – it’s significant
to note that he also has employed alternate virgin covers in allowing the
reader a different type of access to his work than comics typically allows.
His images are lush and lavishly textured, each issue taking months to
produce.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/artofjml1.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2740" title="artofjml1"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/artofjml1-221x300.jpg
" alt="" width="221" height="300" /></a>Despite the obvious craft that goes
into even the smallest panel in “Dawn,” however, it is still marketed as
comics instead of as art directly. Interestingly, however, Linsner’s
publisher Image Comics also produces full size, more conventional volumes of
Linsner’s work titled “The Art of Joseph Michael Linsner” – here, we see
Linsner’s paintings in full page spreads (often the reproduced covers of his
individual issues) with no text at all except for the occasional appending
paragraph discussing the motivation behind an individual piece. It appears,
at least in this case (though there are many others, including the
superlative work of Dave McKean and Adam Hughes), that we are more
comfortable labeling art as such only when it is unaccompanied by textual
content, when the images are the sole offering and are allowed to speak
entirely for themselves.

	There is a single case in which comics are, in the industry, consistently
referred to as art, and that is when one is trying to acquire an original
page from which all others were produced. Collectors of “original art” in
comics similarly divorce the original textual context from the drawings
themselves, collecting particularly provocative pages removed from the
storyline as a whole, removed even from the plotlines of the individual
issues of which they ultimately became only a part.

	<a href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oa2.jpg"><img
class="alignleft  wp-image-2742" title="oa2"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oa2-226x300.jpg"
alt="" width="190" height="254" /></a>There is something Benjamin-esque in
this, in attempting to catch the aura of a work surrounding its original
production prior to its mass production on the newsstands. Pages of original
art are often stained, sketched over with blue pencil, handwritten in the
margins with editorial notations – they are the least polished versions of
the final product, and yet they are sought after as art far more than their
reproduced descendants. The monetary value of these pages also mirrors that
of what we would commonly call art, even moreso in the age of digital
reproduction, often fetching thousands and even tens of thousands of dollars
for a single page. Art, then, is here again tied to our traditional concerns
with valuing a work wherein we provide the context for the image instead of
having it provided for us through text or narrative.

	There’s something ineffable about accompanying text that makes us not
necessarily devalue the art object but value it differently, in terms that
perhaps society has yet to define. Perhaps the blending of image and text
creates a new, transcendent art form as we struggle to adapt to the competing
visual representations of storytelling juxtaposed with our own stories
intertwined, making sense of the images in tandem with having them made sense
for us. It is in this liminal space, though, that comics become the most
engaging, playing to and against our expectations of literature as art and
“art” as art.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[So, my plan to write
about the connections between comics and fine art went out the window. I was
going to talk about Picasso’s love of <em>The Katzenjammer Kids</em>, the
links between Philip Guston, Robert Crumb and Öyvind Fahlström, and the more
recent phenomenon of artists, such as Olivia Plender, using comics as the
medium for their work. But the ‘best-laid schemes o' mice an' men, Gang aft
agley’ as a famous Scotsman once said, and the greatest comic book
writer/artist in the world was coming to the UK to do a talk.

	I wouldn’t make an 800 mile round trip for just anybody you understand,
but Jaime Hernandez (or Xaime as he signs his work) visited London last week
for the first time in 25 years. THIS WAS NO SMALL BEANS PEOPLE! Along with
his brother Gilbert, he has been producing the comic <em>Love &amp;
Rockets</em> in various formats for 30 years (with occasional contributions
from older brother Mario). As I mentioned in <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2013/01/22/100-standing-in-relation-to-
comics-a-special-100th-post/" target="_blank">Graphixia #100</a>, the cover
to <em>Love &amp; Rockets</em> issue 24 is my favourite ever.

	&nbsp;

alt="" width="231" height="300" /></a> Love &amp; Rockets #24[/caption]

	To look at a Jaime Hernandez comics page is to catch a glimpse of
perfection. His artwork appears effortless but has evolved over the years; he
mentioned that he gradually did away with hatching (along with the sci-fi
trappings of his early stories) to leave the pages with clean lines and
blocks of black and white. He is a master of chiaroscuro and admitted to
preferring not to work in colour. I haven’t seen a page of his original art
but the reproductions in <em><a
href="http://abramscomicarts.com/qa-with-todd-hignite/" target="_blank">The
Art of Jaime Hernandez</a> </em>show them to be very close to the printed
comics, with very little pencils or whiteout visible.

	The <a
href="http://www.comicafestival.com/index.php/site/news/
jaime_hernandez_of_love_rockets_in_london_may_30th"
target="_blank">Comica</a> talk took place at the <a
href="http://www.institut-francais.org.uk/" target="_blank">Institut
Français</a> as part of the Bande Dessinée &amp; Comics Passion weekend.
Jaime stopped off on his way to an appearance at Copenhagen Comics festival.
He was interviewed by Woodrow Phoenix, also a man with a long history in
comics and creator of the very fine book <em><a
href="http://www.myriadeditions.com/Rumble-Strip" target="_blank">Rumble
Strip</a></em>. It was a long interview and Phoenix allowed Jaime to talk in
depth, although his questions came from the perspective of a <em>Love &amp;
Rockets</em> aficionado and might have baffled any newbies in the audience
(although one of the people I was with was new to L&amp;R and he went out and
bought <em>Maggie the Mechanic</em> the next morning!).

	The latter part of the interview was a live talk and draw in which
Jaime’s drawing pad was projected on the huge cinema screen behind him. This
provided an excellent opportunity to see his drawings blown up to gigantic
proportions. Personally, I love seeing comic art at ridiculously huge sizes;
it changes the way we see the art and makes it into something new. As we
shuffled into the auditorium the screen was showing the classic panel from
<em>Love &amp; Rockets</em> issue 21 with Hopey’s band La Llorona on stage
and the singer Monica berating the hecklers with the immortal line ‘If you
were really hardcore, you'd have thrown a full bottle.’ A line so good Jaime
also uses it as his bio on Twitter.

	[caption id="attachment_2782" align="aligncenter" width="614"]<a

jpg" alt="" width="614" height="401" /></a> Jaime Hernandez at the Institut
Français 30th May 2013[/caption]

	One thing the talk and draw proved (as Phoenix pointed out), was that
Jaime can’t talk and draw at the same time! When giving a long answer he
tended to stop drawing but we were then treated to the sight of his very
expressive hand movements projected onto the cinema screen. Unfortunately
some comments from the audience were boringly predictable; the first question
was about Maggie’s weight, a tedious topic that was surely put to bed 25
years ago. When asked what he should draw, the first request was for Penny
Century, the glamorous pin-up and wannabe superhero from Jaime’s Locas
strips. I would have preferred a drawing of H.R. Costigan, her horned
billionaire husband.

	After a session that ran over 2 hours in length, Jaime then graciously
agreed to do a signing and about half the cinema gathered in a very orderly
queue to get their books signed. I had a brief chat with Jaime as he signed
my  1980s Titan Books editions of his work (with great covers designed by
Rian Hughes) and wished him well for his trip to Copenhagen. Jaime came
across as one of the sweetest, modest and generous folks that you could hope
to meet and I look forward to following his stories for many years to come.

interviewing Jaime Hernandez[/caption]

	I used my fleeting London visit to seek out other comics events. The Roy
Lichtenstein show at the Tate had closed (someone else who likes comics
panels blown up huge) but the response show at <a
href="http://www.orbitalcomics.com/" target="_blank">Orbital Comics</a> was
still on. <em><a
href="http://www.orbitalcomics.com/image-duplicator16052013-to-31052013/"
target="_blank">Image Duplicator</a> </em>was an interesting exhibition
featuring work by Rian Hughes, Dave Gibbons and other cartoonists,
illustrators and designers. Their work ‘re-reappropriated’ the original
comics panels that Lichtenstein used in his work. The main difference with
these works was that they credited the original artists, something
Lichtenstein failed to do.

	I also managed to catch Sarah Lightman’s exhibition <em><a
href="http://www.sarahlightman.com/" target="_blank">The Book of Sarah: A
Life in Drawings and Animation Films</a></em> at the Occupy My Time Gallery
in Deptford. This was a great show featuring work from Lightman’s ongoing
autobiographical project The Book of Sarah, due to be published in 2015. Her
pencil drawings dwell on the everyday details of unhappy experiences, making
them into beautiful art. She studied at The Slade School of Art and initially
struggled with where her work fitted into the art world. I chatted to Sarah
in the gallery about comics, autobiography and art, and she mentioned how, as
she slowly discovered comics, her work began to make sense. She is also a
tireless promoter of life narrative comics and co-founded <a
href="http://www.laydeezdocomics.com/" target="_blank">Laydeez do Comics</a>
with Nicola Streeten.

	[caption id="attachment_2778" align="alignleft" width="213"]<a

alt="" width="213" height="300" /></a> Sarah Lightman <em>In
Memoriam</em>[/caption]

	Lightman’s art has a lot of space in it and the pencil marks are obvious
and deliberate, you can see what the drawing was made with, unlike Jaime's
work with its solid blacks with no sign of brushstrokes. Even when reproduced
in a different medium, such as the films Lightman makes of her work, the
materiality of her pencil shines through. This is very deliberate and
Lightman also spoke about showing the work respect, the drawings were
beautifully presented in frames in the gallery space. I wondered whether
there was a definitive version of the work, drawings, comics or film. I
really enjoy this multi-media playing around with the comics form and I am
fascinated to see artists embrace site-specific comics. Like Olivia Plender,
Lightman is an artist who happens to use comics as the medium to present her
work.

	So there you go I still managed to talk about comics and art!

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I was there too, what a f*****g night! Man I was
so nervous when I met him but he was SO NICE. Woodrow Phoenix was a great and
incisive interviewer. D'ya remember when the French dude (rather cheekily)
asked if Jaime was: "too old to check out new music and gigs" (I'm
paraphrasing, there!)?!?!? Cheeky b*****d! But yeah, great night...I only had
to travel 300 miles round trip, but.....if ever summat was worth it, it was
shaking the hand of one of the Greatest Living Cartoonists! Got some photos
on my blog but they're s****y compared to yours! Oh, and f**k Roy
Lichenstein! All the best!

at <a href="http://www.comicsgrid.com/" target="_blank">The Comics Grid</a>,
everyone at Graphixia is very excited to be hosting our first conference
starting tomorrow. Scholars from around the globe will convene in Vancouver
on Thursday 13th of June for the launch of <em><a
href="http://www.thedclab.org/conference/" target="_blank">Comics &amp; the
Multimodal World</a>.</em>

	The multidisciplinary conference, hosted by <a
href="http://www.douglas.bc.ca/home.html" target="_blank">Douglas
College</a> in New Westminster, B.C., examines how comics intersect with
digital culture, multimodal narrative, internationalism, information design,
and alternative literacies.

	The conference will feature student workshops, community forums, comics
practitioners, booksellers, academic paper presentations, and two keynote
lectures by <a href="http://www.thedclab.org/conference/keynote-speaker/"
target="_blank">Sarah Leavitt and Bart Beaty</a> on Friday and Saturday
evening.

	We are also very proud to be launching an exhibition of comic art at the
Amelia Douglas Gallery (running until June 28). Curated by Allan Haverholm,<a
href="http://www.thedclab.org/conference/sequential-investigations-the-new-
comics/" target="_blank"><em> Sequential Investigations: The New
Comics</em></a> features drawings, comics, and installations from an
international group of comics artists including Warren Craghead, Simon
Moreton, Sophie Yanow, Julie Delporte and many more.

	You can <strong><a href="http://comics2013.eventbrite.ca/"
target="_blank">register for these events</a></strong> if you are a community
member or student. You can also <strong><a
href="http://comics2013.eventbrite.ca/" target="_blank">register for the
conference at special rates</a></strong> if you are a community member,
student in the Lower Mainland of B.C. or a member of the Douglas College
community.

	We hope to see you there!]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[From Thursday, June 13
through Sunday, June 16, in partnership with the <a
title="http://www.comicsgrid.com/" href="http://www.comicsgrid.com/"
target="_blank">Comics Grid</a>, Graphixia held its first conference <a
href="http://www.thedclab.org/conference/portfolio" target="_blank">(view the
conference website here)</a> at <a title="http://www.douglas.bc.ca/home.html"
href="http://www.douglas.bc.ca/home.html">Douglas College</a> in New
Westminster British Columbia. As the conference approached, I began to dread
it; I have never been so anxious in my life. Because we decided to put on an
art exhibiton to augment the conference (thanks to the efforts of <a
title="http://about.me/haverholm" href="http://about.me/haverholm"
target="_blank">Allan Haverholm</a>), I spent the day before the conference
rushing around town, looking for the right kind of foam board on which to
mount the art, getting the digital prints printed, and hanging the art in the
Amelia Douglas Gallery. I did this not by myself, mind you, but alongside
Hattie Kennedy, Damon Herd, David N. Wright, Liz McCausland, and Art
Rhodes–the man from the College whose job is fittingly to hang art. Still,
even with everyone working so hard, it did not seem possible that we would be
able to bring this event off successfully. There were too many loose ends and
things undone. Fortunately, the people who come to conferences see only
what’s there, not what is missing, and once we were underway, many of my
nerves subsided.

	We warmed up everyone at the conference with casual conversational
sessions on general themes on the Thursday. These free-flowing discussion set
the tone for the conference because they included the kind of stuff people
talk about late at night in the bar at conferences. There was a real
cameraderie among presenters, who came from Canada, The US, the UK, and
Australia. Ernesto Priego, the editor in chief of the Comics Grid arrived at
1:00 am on Thursday from Mexico City via Toronto! The presenters were a great
bunch: participatory, intellectually generous, and gracious. The final
discussion of Thursday, a forum on comics and the digital humanities <a
href="http://www.thedclab.org/conference/media-recordings/"
target="_blank">(listen to it here)</a>, treated the audience to a stunning
conference version of Kraftwerk: four men with their macbooks lined up in
front of the audience, each offering insight into the curious connection
between these subjects.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-6.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2891" title="Kraftwerk"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-6-1024x768.jpg"
alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a>

	What really worked well were the workshops led by Damon Herd, Roger
Whitson, and Ian Horton. Each in its own way could claim to be the conference
highlight. These sessions focused not just on listening but on doing. Damon
had us evaluate some strips he had drawn to make us reflect on on fact and
fiction in autobiographical comics and the pact between the artist and
reader. Damon charmed the audience with his strips and his challenge to
figure out which one was “untrue” and why. Roger talked about how comics can
introduce multimodality to composition classes and had people get in pairs to
script a collaborative project that would would involve making comics. Held
on the Friday afternoon, Roger’s talk <a
href="http://www.thedclab.org/conference/media-recordings/"
target="_blank">(listen to it here)</a> was perhaps the climax of the
conference, thanks to good attendance and his energetic, engaging style. Ian
discussed the complexities of infocomics while also showing their history in
children’s periodicals such as <em>Look and Learn</em> and <em>World of
Wonder</em>. He then had each of us create an infocomic on the history of
Vancouver derived from Wikipedia, and photographed the results. I had seen
Ian present elsewhere and was really glad to have him at this conference
because I admire his ability to draw out ideas in a way that I can only
describe as tactful: his respect for the material he examines generates his
insight.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-6-copy-
e1371616259221.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2894"

e1371616259221.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="960" /></a>

	The keynotes from Bart Beaty and Sarah Leavitt <a
href="http://youtu.be/wt5IKl8v9xY" target="_blank">(watch Sarah's talk
here)</a> were both excellent, and both speakers did more at the conference
than simply show up for their talk and leave; they attended other sessions
and participated fully. Beaty spoke about Comics vs Art and the incursion of
comics into the gallery and performance space through connections with other
arts, like music, sculpture, and dance. Not everyone I spoke to agreed with
Bart’s vision of comics becoming art, but there was a universal sense of it
being a great talk. Sarah Leavitt conducted a workshop on turning life
experiences into comics and gave a keynote about the production of <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Tangles-Story-About-Alzheimers-Mother/dp/
1616086394" target="_blank"><em>Tangles</em></a> her graphic memoir about
dealing with her mother’s death from Alzheimer’s disease. Sarah’s talk was
difficult for some in the audience because her experience with her mother
reflected their own traumas with ailing and dying loved ones. Sarah leavened
the talk, though, with humour and sensitivity. She is not only a great artist
and storyteller but a fabulous speaker.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Sarah-Leavitt-
headshot-bw.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2904"
title="Sarah-Leavitt-headshot-bw"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Sarah-Leavitt-
headshot-bw.jpg" alt="" /></a>

	This was the first conference I had attended that used video streaming
for a paper presentation, a practice that is increasingly common. Lise
Tannahill, in her first ever conference paper, gave a great presentation from
Glasgow on identity in <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9cassine"
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9cassine"
target="_blank"><em>Becassine</em></a>. With graduate students strapped for
conference funding, I predict many more such presentations in the future. On
the one hand it’s great that they be able to present, but on the other, being
at conferences in flesh and blood is crucial to the experience.

	Another highlight was the final day’s round table reflection on comics,
art and training <a
href="http://www.thedclab.org/conference/media-recordings/"
target="_blank">(listen to it here)</a>, during which we discussed how comics
production and coding were similar; the fact that comics were emblematic of a
larger multimodal literacy required in the 21st Century; and the age-old
problems of race and gender in the closed-off community of the comics shop.
Brenna Clarke Gray, a core Graphixian, was able to join us from the Douglas
College field school in Wales, which was important, because we missed her
during the rest of the conference. Unfortunately, Scott Marsden was unable to
join us, as he was home celebrating his first ever fathers’ day.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Graphixia-Crew.jpg">
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2896" title="Graphixia Crew"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Graphixia-Crew.jpg"
alt="" /></a>

	Students, faculty, and staff from Douglas College attended the conference
and engaged fully with the presenters. Of course, I had hoped that hundreds
of students would turn out, but I was extremely happy that those who did
attend were so up for participating in the conference. And the conference
really came together on Twitter. Ernesto Priego created this <a
href="http://hawksey.info/tagsexplorer/arc.html?key=tkt6UMNAXGwRBf4pjkiBxwQ"
target="_blank">archive of tweets</a> that used the #graphixia13 hash tag <a
href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Graphixia13&amp;src=hash"
target="_blank">(see the tweets here)</a>. It shows that Comics and the
Multimodal World generated over 2000 tweets that included summaries of what
speakers were saying, critical commentary and reflection, photographs and
drawings.

	The Aboriginal Gathering Place at Douglas College was the main venue for
panels and workshops. What an incredible place it is, and many of the
international visitors commented on it. We are very grateful to Dave Seaweed
at the College for allowing us to use it. It is not simply a classroom or a
conference room, but a sacred space.

	As the conference drew to a close, the dread that had preceded it had
given way to excitement for the future. My co-organizer, David N Wright,
tweeted “What next?” to me on Sunday evening. And by the time Monday hit, we
were trying to decide whether the next conference should be at Douglas
College or somewhere else in the world: Graphixia14: <em>Comics and the
Global Humanities</em> in London and Graphixia15: <em>Comics and the
Archive</em> in Mexico City seemed like realistic possibilities. If those
come to fruition, it will have been quite something to have held the first
Graphixia conference at Douglas College in New
Westminster.]]></content:encoded>

and Allegory in Renee French&#039;s Micrographica</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[“There is not enough
love and goodness in the world to permit giving any of it away to imaginary
beings.” Nietzsche, <em>Human, All Too Human</em>

	I’m no expert in anthropomorphism in comics and its history, but I
suppose it is pretty much co-extensive with “funny animal” comics, like Carl
Barks’ <em>Donald Duck</em> and Dave Sim’s <em>Cerebus</em>. For me the most
satisfying comics with anthropomorphic animal characters are those that Jason
produces. His mournful humanoid dogs and birds seem all the more human for
their non-human characteristics.

	This de- and re-humanizing links anthropomorphic comics to fables, the
allegorical stories that substitute animals for humans as a means of
enhancing the stories’ parabolic nature. Using animals in human situations
means that the fable represents a general case rather than a specific
instance of human behaviour. The substitution de-historicizes a story so that
it can have a moral that applies to the ages and to all peoples; hence the
critique of such stories as ahistorical and acultural: falsely neutral. But
when an animal fable is overtly historical, like Orwell’s <em>Animal
Farm</em>, the conversion from human to animal seems pointless. I’m sure they
made us read it in high school because connecting the dots is so easy. I
prefer something like Melville’s <em>Moby-Dick</em>, though it is only partly
an animal fable, that manages to provide a specific historical critique of
slavery, whiteness, and power while also tilting at universal concepts. But
this aside is taking me too far from comics, where anthropomorphism means
allegory, unless it is just a gimmick.

	Renee French really tests the line between allegory and gimmick in
<em>Micrographica</em>. She drew the panels for this comic in one centimetre
squares, which she then blew up for publication. This method of drawing
comics gives rise to the question of whether we ought to do something just
because we can do it. My answer, in French’s case, is yes because of the way
her play with the relationship between small and big goes beyond gimmicky
constraint to address the issue of allegorical thinking. At the Comics and
the Multimodal World conference last week, <a
title="http://www.rogerwhitson.net/" href="http://www.rogerwhitson.net/"
target="_blank">Roger Whitson</a> introduced the concept of “distant reading”
as opposed to the “close reading” that dominated thinking about literature in
the mid- to late-twentieth century. Distant reading asserts that large
patterns are as important as small ones; it strikes me that the idea is a
kind of fractalism. In any event, by working in such a confined space, which
limits how much information she can put in her drawings, French must deal
with “big picture” ideas.

	In <em>Micrographica,</em> these ideas are ownership, friendship, and
belonging. French seems wants to get at the most basic pleasures and fears
that constitute a person, a masculine person at that, as the book deals
almost entirely with homosocial structures. The book features four rodents
(the consensus seems to be that they are naked mole rats, but I can’t see any
confirmation in the text), a crap ball and the caterpillar-like creature
within it, a sandwich, a human corpse, a glove, and a mountain.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-
25-at-8.07.59-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2935"

25-at-8.07.59-PM-852x1024.png" alt="" width="852" height="1024" /></a>

	Preston and Moe have the kind of antagonistic friendship we might
associate with teenaged boys. They harangue and humiliate each other
incessantly with farts and “your mom” jokes. Preston is the needier partner,
who needs to assert that the crap ball belongs to him, its initial
discoverer. The crap ball is Preston’s treasure, validating him as a
worthwhile individual. But Moe gets the upper hand on Preston by not
caring–his detachment does the same thing for him as the crap ball does for
Preston.

	The “mom” jokes Preston and Moe direct toward each other give the book an
object relations angle, with the crap ball being a kind of surrogate maternal
object: it even contains a living being! There are no father references,
interestingly enough, but if we wanted to get really far out, we could
consider the obviously male human corpse that Moe and Preston crawl over and
into as the symbolic dead father. For them the body is just a thing with no
individuality or personality.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-
25-at-8.09.59-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2938"

25-at-8.09.59-PM-794x1024.png" alt="" width="794" height="1024" /></a>

	These are post-oedipal mole rats, finding their way in the world as
independent beings yet craving meaningful attachment. Moe and Preston are
continually fending each other off and drawing each other closer as they try
to figure out what is more important: their connection with each other or
their individual power in the world.

	No matter how much Preston and Moe harrass each other, they are a team.
Their squabbles are like those of an old married couple.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-
25-at-8.12.10-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2941"

25-at-8.12.10-PM-852x1024.png" alt="" width="852" height="1024" /></a>

	Aldo, meanwhile, is on the outside looking in, doing whatever he can to
ingratiate himself with the other two. He offers them part of a sandwich he
has found, his generosity counterbalancing Preston’s need to keep his crap
ball to himself. When the crap ball that Moe and Preston have left in Aldo’s
care breaks, Aldo goes on a quest for more crap to replace it.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-
25-at-8.11.07-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2943"

25-at-8.11.07-PM-903x1024.png" alt="" width="903" height="1024" /></a>

	Aldo, it seems, will do anything to purchase acceptance, sacrificing
individual power for a belonging that never arrives. The irony here is that
absence of belonging creates a kind of independence that no one wants. French
suggests that the homosocial condition is that individual power requires
belonging so as to have someone else to boss around.

	The fourth character, Nubbins, acts as the figure of allegory itself. He
directs Aldo on his quest for more crap to replace the broken crap ball,
giving him the delusion that more crap equals more likelihood of belonging.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-
25-at-8.11.23-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2945"

25-at-8.11.23-PM-777x1024.png" alt="" width="777" height="1024" /></a>

	However, Aldo makes a Kafka-esque mistake. Consider the following Franz
Kafka parable, “On Parables” <blockquote>Many complain that the words of the
wise are always merely parables and of no use in daily life, which is the
only life we have. When the sage says: “Go over,” he does not mean that we
should cross over to some actual place, which we could do anyhow if the labor
were worth it; he means some fabulous yonder, something unknown to us,
something too that he cannot designate more precisely, and therefore cannot
help us here in the very least. All these parables really set out to say
merely that the incomprehensible is incomprehensible, and we know that
already. But the cares we have to struggle with every day: that is a
different matter.

	Concerning this a man once said: Why such reluctance? If you only
followed the parables you yourselves would become parables and with that rid
yourself of all your daily cares.

	Another said: I bet that is also a parable.

	The first said: You have won.

	The second said: But unfortunately only in parable.

	The first said: No, in reality: in parable you have lost.</blockquote>
Aldo confuses the literal and the figurative, the real and the parabolic, as
he is unable to see the “mountain of crap” for what it is.

	Renee French’s <em>Micrographica</em> is the comic book equivalent of the
great literary parables. In it, small becomes big, crap becomes treasure, and
significance emerges from the complex permutations we can generate from its
simple elements. Does it matter that this parable is acted out by naked mole
rats: hairless, helpless creatures scrabbling around with balls of crap?
That’s for each reader to decide.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Anthropomorphism
defines the practice of making things that are inhuman seem human. But what
happens when artists exploit the inhuman to tell a story about the nature of
humanity, highlighting the opacity of our behaviour, both toward each other
and toward others? At the same time, anthropomorphism has increasingly become
a synonym for skeuomorphism&#8211;that of making something so that it
resembles another material or technique. The &#8220;gesture&#8221; controls
of the full screen smart phone for example exhibit elements of skeumorphic
design while at the same time, beneath the layers lies the anthropomorphic
voice of Siri. Into the environment walks the much already praised
<em>Hawkeye #11</em>.

	<em>Hawkeye</em> and the questions it raises about art <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2013/05/07/115-okay-this-looks-bad-
hawkeye-and-the-problem-with-comics-as-art/" target="_blank">have already
been discussed</a> in this space, but the much anticipated arrival of issue
#11 called for another take on the comic and the way it rebounds off our
cultural climate. Affectionately called the &#8220;Pizza Dog Issue,&#8221;
<em>Hawkeye #11</em> features an entire narrative from the dog&#8217;s
perspective as he disentangles a recent murder. As close to a wordless comic
as mainstream comics is likely to get, the issue features no written words
except those a dog might understand.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hawkeye11_06.jpg"><
img src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hawkeye11_06.jpg"
alt="" title="hawkeye11_06" width="480" height="738" class="aligncenter
size-full wp-image-2961" /></a>

	Matt Fraction, David Aja, and Matt Hollingsworth take the style of
anthropomorphism and totally ignore it. While there are certainly instances
in which Pizza Dog imitates human elements, the reader is entirely in the
dog&#8217;s world as s/he deciphers the evolving narrative (there&#8217;s a
whole other post on the relevance of the detective narrative here, but no
time). Gone are the allusions to Mickey Mouse, or the clever asides that
might arise if Pizza Dog were given the opportunity to express himself using
a language more familiar to humans. In short, the reader is put in the
position of figuring out that &#8220;Timmy is down in the well&#8221; as
Pizza Dog deciphers the guilty parties in the crime.

	What interests me more than the narrative itself and even the
acknowledged skill in rendering the story without the crutch of
anthropomorphism, is how the issue reflects the relationship between comics,
particularly in a design sense, and the mobile, interconnected, internet
world we live in.

	We&#8217;re all very familiar with skeuomorphic design even if we have no
idea what it is. The most obvious place we find it is on our electronic
devices, where digital spaces are given flashes that make it more palatable
as a real-world object. Apple's Calendar app, with its discrete torn paper
shreds at the top is a classic example:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hawkeye11_05.png"><
img src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hawkeye11_05.png"
alt="" title="hawkeye11_05" width="263" height="241" class="aligncenter
size-full wp-image-2963" /></a>

	In the same way that the panels in comics imply movement across time and
space, the skeuomorphic design of digital environments suggests that those
environments are in some way &#8220;real&#8221; objects, or belong in the
catalogue of real objects that we understand. It&#8217;s not a multi-layered
structure of written code read by a microchip that turns on and off relays
according to binary code; it&#8217;s a calendar like we have on our desk.
Comics are not a series of broken and disjointed images put into a
sequence&#8211;a sequential narrative&#8211;they are a commentary on lives
lived as you our I might wish. In short, we recognize both spaces as familiar
to us and what we experience in the world. Of course, neither of the
spaces&#8211;the calendar or the comics&#8211;are a true simulacrum of the
world, but it&#8217;s close enough.

	What&#8217;s interesting about <em>Hawkeye #11</em> is how it transposes
the above comforting elements of anthropomorphism and skeuomorphism onto a
story told by a dog. The reason we embed elements of the real world in our
computer design is so that we don&#8217;t freak out and wonder what the
hell-alien thing we are looking at is supposed to do&#8211;it&#8217;s a
calendar; I understand that. Anthropomorphism is the same: when the dogs,
cats, mice, pigs, horses, cows, hurricanes, and HAL2000 computers talk to us
or feel what we feel, we can relate; they are us. The real strength of
<em>Hawkeye #11</em> is the way it forces us to reconsider how we understand
our world or, better, how other things might understand our world.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hawkeye11_03.jpg"><
img src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hawkeye11_03.jpg"
alt="" title="hawkeye11_03" width="480" height="738" class="aligncenter
size-full wp-image-2964" /></a>

	To Pizza Dog, we&#8217;re a jumble of scents, accents, and food scraps
that signal love, distance, abuse and stupidity. That Pizza Dog maintains his
dogness in the story is the highest form of flattery, despite what one might
say about how Fraction, Aja, and Hollingsworth interpret the life of a dog
(unfortunately the dog didn&#8217;t write it). The flip into a dog&#8217;s
world forces the reader to perform interpretive acts in much the same manner
that one imagines a dog would have to; we&#8217;re slowly piecing things
together until we figure out that this two-legged thing who feeds us wants us
to get the damn ball. We&#8217;re all dogs sniffing our way through the
fire-hydrants in the narrative Pizza Dog is walking us through.

	As is frequently the case with the creative team behind <em>Hawkeye</em>,
the most interesting point of contact with the story comes from its
representation. It&#8217;s also where the skeuomorphic comes back in.
There&#8217;s clearly been a conscious choice here to represent the
dog&#8217;s sensory input through iconography. The image-squares in the comic
illustrate the mental workings of Pizza Dog, telling us what he&#8217;s
thinking, what he hears, smells, tastes, remembers. How the design of
<em>Hawkeye #11</em> reflects the interface most of us have with the modern
world is really its highlight. The comic is a series of icons in the format
familiar to those of us who own and use smartphones daily&#8211;the rounded
corners of the image-squares, the consistent iconography, the clean,
associative connections between icon and thing or action.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hawkeye11_01.jpg"><
img src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hawkeye11_01.jpg"
alt="" title="hawkeye11_01" width="480" height="738" class="aligncenter
size-full wp-image-2965" /></a>

	I can only wish that my phone&#8217;s homescreen looked as slick as the
above page. But, it says something more that the creative team has chosen to
use this design sense over others to represent Pizza Dog&#8217;s inner
workings. They&#8217;ve chosen a familiar setting for most of us, one that
sees our thumb gently press on squares to call up skeuomorphic
representations of our world&#8211;calendars, maps, mail. The rub is that
this world is now being utilized by the anthropomorphic thoughts of a dog.
The whole mashup clearly illustrates how interrelated the design functions of
comics are with those common to the internet and the mobile / digital
environments that bring that internet to us in a recognizable and usable
format. That Pizza Dog&#8217;s thoughts are coming to us through icons and
image sequences over language signals a decisive shift in what exactly makes
us comfortable when representing things that are normally obscured.

	What <em>Hawkeye #11</em> does is make us look more closely at our
homescreens, our apps, our dashboards, our desktops, to see how they are, in
effect, comics. These digital spaces are sequential narratives that are
unique to each of us who use, understand, and organize them; they make us
comfortable as we record, interpret, and participate in the virtual world.

	Anthropomorphism need no longer refer to instilling human elements onto
an inhuman thing. Fraction, Aja, and Hollingsworth have shown us how comics,
and the digital design strategies that come from them, are the new common
language, one detached from the utterance but born from the gestured swipe
across an empty gutter.

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Excellent commentary, but your best
		point was one I'd missed entirely: "What Hawkeye #11 does is make us
		look more closely at our homescreens, our apps, our dashboards, our
		desktops, to see how they are, in effect, comics."  It's not
		literally true, but close enough to make me do a double-take and
		think again about the icons, symbols, and semiotics surrounding me.
		What Fraction and Aja were looking at here involves understanding
		without words - and most comics contain words. It's taking the words
		out that make us look at the perceptions differently.  One of the
		joys here is the way we see the intersection of perception between
		Pizza Dog and us - we see our world differently, with fewer fire
		hydrants and less significant pizza rinds, but we also see the faces,
		the buildings, the body language; hear the vocal tones and the
		significant words. What makes meaning?  Shared interpretation of our
		senses.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Anthropomorphism has a rich history in
		comic books, though we may not immediately be cognizant of this fact
		– most of our classic heroes are imbued with the traits of animals
		(Spider-man, Batman), and the tradition has continued through to the
		Bronze and Modern Ages in characters like Wolverine and Animal Man,
		newly repopularized in the superb Jeff Lemire series. Characters with
		animal qualities are legion, however so are those who are actually
		speaking animals themselves: Gorilla Grodd, the Flash’s telepathic
		and genius nemesis; the laser toting Rocket Raccoon from
		<em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> (who will be amazing to see in this
		summer’s upcoming eponymous film); the drunk and depraved Howard the
		Duck; and Killer Croc from the various Batman series to name a few.
		There are even animal Green Lanterns, being the dog-creature G’nort
		and the squirrel Ch’p, who are presented as equally heroic and
		willful as any of their humanoid teammates. Similarly, we’ve recently
		been given a <em>Red </em>Lantern cat, Dex-Starr, whose powers derive
		from rage instead of will – an interesting amplification of the
		hostility we feel from the creatures most of the time. Animals w<a
		href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/1242337-
		kitty_.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2979"
		title="1242337-kitty_"
		src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/1242337-
		kitty_-190x300.jpg" alt="" width="190" height="300" /></a>ithout
		speaking roles are common as well, and I’m reminded of Ace the
		Bat-Hound, Krypto the superdog, and arguably the most fun:  the
		unnamed cat from <em>Justice League Europe</em> who, with a camera
		implanted in its eye, worked as an unwitting spy against the team.
		Side stories were told from its own perspective, including unreadable
		world balloons since cats, of course, can’t understand English.

	Comics are, at their core, fascinated with animals, and there is hardly a
series that does not approach them in some way. Some have argued that this is
because we’re not creative enough in imagining our superior selves, and the
most common powers that we fantasize about having (flight, strength, speed)
stem from what we’re most familiar with in the natural world, whether the
general readership is aware of this quality in comics or not. Others argue
that it’s a hangover from the days of Aesop, where the allegory of the animal
is the path of least resistance when attempting to generate larger moral
statements on the nature of humanity. I’m more of the mind that we employ
animals in comics because we inherently realize the limitations of our human
forms and are constantly seeking alternate means of rationalizing our worlds
through means that, while unrealistic, have some semblance of plausibility –
animals allow us to think beyond ourselves in ways that have been presented
as specious in most media, from Wells’ <em>Island of Dr. Moreau</em> to
Cronenberg’s <em>The Fly</em>, resulting in fascinating storytelling and
fantastic worlds that are not so surreal as to ostracize us from
participation within them. Despite the overwhelming presence of animals in
comics, however, few series point to it explicitly as motivation. There
appears to be a passive acceptance of this convention in comics that is
rarely expounded upon overtly.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Albedo2.jpg"><img
class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2976" title="Albedo2"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Albedo2-195x300.jpg"
alt="" width="195" height="300" /></a>This said, while mainstream comics have
accessed the animal in various ways, there remain standout series that have
indeed openly reveled in the anthropomorphic to very interesting and
innovative ends. <em>Albedo Anthropomorphics,</em> published by Thoughts and
Images in 1983, was one of the earliest series to do this, inspiring a number
of “furry” series that followed in <em>Critters</em>, <em>Furrlough</em> and
<em>Genus</em> among others. The series was most noted for the introduction
of Stan Sakai’s Usagi Yojimbo, a samurai rabbit in a carefully constructed
and historically accurate feudal Japan populated by talking cats, pandas,
foxes and dogs. Throughout the series, the only constant was the animals
themselves, as stories shifted between accessing the distant past to the
remote futures of speculative fiction, all while maintaining an adult tone
and thematic content, primarily exploring issues of gender, loyalty and
responsibility. <em>Albedo</em> quickly became a cult phenomenon and was
picked up by the larger publisher Antarctic Press in several incarnations
over the years, the most recent being in 2005.

	What was most intriguing about <em>Albedo Anthropomorphics</em> was how
un-anthropomorphic it was while highlighting, even in its title, its ultimate
focus. The stories appearing in the series visually represented all their
characters as animals while totally ignoring this in the actual dialog. If
one were to simply read the scripts for the stories, there would be nothing
to indicate anything feral or anthropomorphic at all. While the medium to
this point had emphasized the conjunction of animal and human in ways that
were blatantly designed to direct our imaginations along predictable and
particular (though sometimes peculiar) guidelines, <em>Albedo</em> upset this
standard by drawing a distinct line between the two concepts, showing how the
animal in comics could be utilized in an entirely different way – not for
highlighting particular powers, or improving upon our collective human
condition, but to radicalize storytelling more generally. The animals in
<em>Albedo</em> appear apparently solely for aesthetic purposes, however they
have inspired an entire subgenre of comics with a large readership that is
based on this disconnect between image and text. What’s most fascinating
about the interplay is that there is actually no interplay at all, save for
any connections that the reader brings with them when engaging with the text.
The result is a surrealist reworking of the genre, creating a cognitive
disconnect that rears its head in unexpected places. How do we rethink
traditionally human concepts like faith, love and honor when these are
delivered by inhuman creatures?

	<a

class="size-medium wp-image-2983 alignleft" title="Turtles1"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Turtles12-300x256.jpg
" alt="" width="300" height="256" /></a>Perhaps the most well known of the
expressly anthropomorphic genre of comics is Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird’s
<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, a series that, while having since
turned to cartoonish stories aimed primarily at a children’s audience, began
as a thoughtful exploration of Japanese culture and Eastern mysticism. A
surprising success, dating back to nearly the same month as <em>Albedo</em>
was first released, <em>TMNT</em> began with an origin story that retained
the specious qualities of anthropomorphics in comics we had come to expect
(radioactive transformation of animals into human-like form) while offering
highly adult themes. Though the series’ first issues were rife with robots
and ninjas, it quickly reframed expectations of comics as a whole. Entirely
creator driven through Mirage Publishing, <em>TMNT</em> grappled with complex
issues of Asian history, urban violence, the nature of religion, and
theoretical speculations on reptilian versus mammalian supremacy in the
natural world. Unlike <em>Albedo</em>, however, the concept of ‘turtles’ and
animalism was never<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/01cover.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2982" title="01cover"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/01cover-202x300.jpg"
alt="" width="202" height="300" /></a> ignored – here, it was exploited to
pursue themes of ancestry, alienation, noblesse oblige and family in ways
difficult to accomplish in traditional literature.

	Suffice it to say, anthropomorphism in comics has been manipulated in
ways obvious and subtle to make us question our assumptions of how we engage
with our own humanity – often, there are traits that are so endemic to the
human condition that we overlook them, and being confronted with animals
helps us to investigate these in provocative ways. Conversely, aspiring to
greatness either physically or intellectually most frequently means
transcending our limitations, or at the very least questioning the boundaries
that are established for us even in the makeup of our own bodies. Animal
visuals coupled with human dialog make us see these as what they really are:
conventions, able to be upset through a dramatic shift in perspective. We
suspend our reality to make room for anthropomorphism – this suspension
allows us to recontextualize other elements of the text, lending itself to a
deconstructive engagement with concepts we otherwise wouldn’t
question.]]></content:encoded>

Encounters With Animals: Revealing our Humanity Through Anthropomorphic
Comics"
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2013/07/09/124-encounters-with-animals-
revealing-our-humanity-through-anthropomorphic-comics/">Last week, Scott</a>
(thanks for swapping with me, buddy!) did a great job of exploring how
anthropomorphism in comics is really more about understanding humanity than
any desire to commune with animals in a significant way.  As Scott notes,
<blockquote>I’m more of the mind that we employ animals in comics because we
inherently realize the limitations of our human forms and are constantly
seeking alternate means of rationalizing our worlds through means that, while
unrealistic, have some semblance of plausibility – animals allow us to think
beyond ourselves in ways that have been presented as specious in most media,
from Wells’ <em>Island of Dr. Moreau</em> to Cronenberg’s <em>The Fly</em>,
resulting in fascinating storytelling and fantastic worlds that are not so
surreal as to ostracize us from participation within them.</blockquote> I
love this reading of the intersection between the animal and the human and
what it means to invoke anthropomorphism.  But Scott's reading focuses on the
superheroic as a place to examine the invocation of animals, and while this
makes a lot of sense (there are so many examples to reflect upon!) I'm more
interested in anthropomorphism in slice of life comics.  While the purpose is
a superhero comic might be quite obvious, why draw on animals-as-humans in
what is supposed to be otherwise a realistic genre?

	For this post, I'm thinking specifically about <em>Fluffy</em>, an
utterly exquisite offering by Simone Lia and published in North America by
DarkHorse Originals.  <em>Fluffy</em> is the story, cryptically enough, of
Fluffy, a bunny who doesn't really know he's a bunny but instead thinks he is
the human child of Michael Pulcino.  Michael, for his part, resists Fluffy's
desire to force him in to the roll of father, and regularly corrects Fluffy's
assumptions, assuring him that he is, in fact, a bunny and not a child.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/fluffy3.jpg"><img
class="size-full wp-image-2988 alignleft" title="fluffy3"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/fluffy3.jpg" alt=""
width="372" height="192" /></a>

	After this panel, he tells Fluffy that Fluffy is "a bunny rabbit."
 Fluffy is horrified by this, throwing a temper tantrum and screaming,
"You're a bad daddy for saying that!"  What Fluffy's anthropomorphism
expresses is a desire to belong; he loves Michael and he loves Michael's
family.  He seems himself as part of it.  So, similar to Scott's discussion
about humanity and anthropomorphism, it's through Fluffy's anthropomorphism
that a yearning for humanity can be expressed.  In this way, Lia explores the
childhood desire for belonging that is such a common part of human
experience.

	Michael's inability to accept Fluffy as his child aligns with his
inability to face a number of issues in his life.  He is being "stalked" by a
woman who believes herself to be his girlfriend but with whom he cannot have
an honest conversation.  (The woman is Fluffy's kindergarten teacher and is
perhaps too close to a happy family for Michael's comfort.)  He is likewise
unable to have an adult conversation with his parents about his role in their
lives and vice versa.  Michael tends to avoid difficult conversations and
moments through the text.  Indeed, while he is the central character in the
narrative, he's not particularly likable because of his inability to cope
with daily life and confrontation.  Michael's growth, within the narrative,
is most clearly marked by his acceptance of Fluffy as his child.

	Fluffy's denial of his inherent bunny-ness is never the focus of the
narrative.  Instead, the anthropomorphism is accepted as fact: Michael's
ability to cope with it is the measure of his compassion and, by extension,
his humanity.]]></content:encoded>

&#034;How is your caudal appendage?&#034; - Anthropomorphism in Linda

alt="" width="442" height="313" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Linda Medley’s ‘Castle Waiting’ is a charming collection of comics that
takes familiar characters and situations from nursery rhymes and fairy tales
and puts them together in an enchanting series of comics. A few years ago the
entire series was collected and published  in two volumes by Fantagraphics.
The collected volumes are lovely books in their own right, probably some of
my favourite comics I own, beautiful hardback books with gorgeous illustrated
chapter dividers and a ribbon to use as a bookmark (what are those things
called?). Medley’s art is wonderful, black and white drawings with characters
that feel so fully realized that they really might just jump out of the pages
and start talking to you.

	&nbsp;

	The first story introduces the character of the titular castle itself
through Medley’s own retelling of the Sleeping Beauty tale. As Sleeping
Beauty is awoken  by Prince Charming, she decides not to stay and rule over
her kingdom but rather to head off into the sunset with her beau and so the
castle is left waiting. We return to it some years later, when it is now
populated by a ramshackle bunch of characters, including Sleeping Beauty’s
own abandoned ladies in waiting. We join the castle just as a new resident
arrives on the scene, Jain who is pregnant and on the run from her tyrannical
husband. Each issue tells a different characters back story, always against
the backdrop of contemporary everyday life in the castle as it waits for its
ruler to return.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-
24-at-17.16.131.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3002"
title="Screen Shot 2013-07-24 at 17.16.13"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-
24-at-17.16.131.png" alt="" width="317" height="274" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	One of my favourite things about Medley is the way in which she
incorporates anthropomorphism into her work. From the fiddle-playing cat who
pops up at a town market, to the three little pigs who wave goodbye to Jain
as she heads out of town, ‘Castle Waiting’ is full of the animals that
populate our nursery rhymes and fairy tales. The town’s money-changer is a
cunning cat dressed in Tudor clothes, while his secretary is a rabbit wearing
a ruff. However this is not presented as anything worthy of any note, indeed
very little reference is made to anyone’s physical appearance and this is
particularly true in the case of two of the main characters. Rackham, the
castle’s stork-headed steward and Chess a travelling Knight and ladies ‘man’
who also happens to be a horse.

	&nbsp;

	‘Castle Waiting’ is funny, really very funny indeed and one of the best
moments in the book comes when the narrative pushes the reader to acknowledge
Rackham’s Stork-like form. After Jain’s baby is born, he is one day taken
away by the castle’s resident bearded nun, who wraps him in a blanket and
persuades Rackham to carry him in his beak and flap his arms despite
Rackham’s protest that “it’s nothing but a folkloric contrivance, and besides
it’s degrading”. A little later in the book we are introduced to Chess and
the doctor enquires of him “How is your caudal appendage?” Chess replies “My
tail?... Should’ve had you remove it years ago. Much more comfortable, and
the <strong>ladies really like it</strong>! Daresay I’ve started a trend”.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-
24-at-17.22.191.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3004 aligncenter"
title="Screen Shot 2013-07-24 at 17.22.19"

24-at-17.22.191-300x276.png" alt="" width="300" height="276" /></a>

	I have read and reread ‘Castle Waiting’ many times now and these panels
never fail to raise a snigger from me. Just as when we read fairy tales and
nursery rhymes as children we never seem to question that a cow might have
jumped over the moon, nor that a cat can play the fiddle, in ‘Castle Waiting’
it seems perfectly right that Chess is one of the kingdom’s most eligible and
popular gentlemen. I love that Medley has created a world so evocative and
real that a dandyish stork man seems perfectly plausible; indeed he only
seems absurd when he is forced to behave like a stork. Medley’s use of
anthropomorphic characters serves to remind us that we only look silly when
we’re pretending to be something we’re not comfortable with.

	In her introduction to ‘Castle Waiting: Volume One’ Jane Yolan calls it
“a feminist fairy tale with attitude, heart, imagination, laughter, love and
truth”, which is just about the perfect description of these books. I’ve
spoken on here before about how I love adaptations that add something to the
original source material and do things a little differently. Medley does all
that and more and even manages to ensure that her adult readers of these
stories learn a little something as they are pushed to reflect on how they
present themselves to others and how they look at and treat those they
encounter.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the many great
things about taking part in an academic conference and presenting a paper is
the feedback and comments one receives from one’s peers. Last month I
presented a paper at the <a
href="http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/ibds/?page_id=372"
target="_blank">International Graphic Novel &amp; International Bande
Dessinée Society Conference</a> in Glasgow (my second favourite conference
that month). My paper, <em>The Parsimonius Cartoonist: Scottish Identity and
the Autobiographical Comics of Eddie Campbell</em> looked at Campbell’s
relationship with money through the prism of that most notorious of Scottish
stereotypes, excessive frugality or tightfistedness.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/scroogemcduck-
e1375221726611.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3023"
title="scroogemcduck"
src="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/scroogemcduck-
217x300.jpg" alt="" width="217" height="300" /></a>During a discussion
afterwards another comics scholar wondered why I hadn’t discussed the Disney
character Scrooge McDuck. Well, for the simple reason that I had never read
any of the comics, “what not even Carl Barks?” they asked incredulously. No,
not even, and I had only a vague recollection of the animated cartoons from
my childhood. Helpfully Graphixia’s anthropomorphic season has allowed me to
address this apparent oversight. By happenstance the second release in the
Fantagraphics<em> Complete Carl Barks Disney Library</em> has only recently
been published and it is all about the aforementioned Mr McDuck -<a
href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/walt-disney-s-uncle-scrooge-
only-a-poor-old-man-june-2012-u.s.-canada-only-6.html" target="_blank"><em>
Walt Disney's Uncle Scrooge: Only a Poor Old Man</em></a>.

	Scrooge McDuck, created by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Barks" target="_blank">Carl Barks</a>
in 1947, is the uncle of Donald Duck on his mother’s side. Although named
after Charles Dickens’ famous miser Ebeneezer Scrooge from <em>A Christmas
Carol</em>, Uncle Scrooge was made to sound even stingier by being Scottish!
Many sources (ie the internet) claim that McDuck was based on industrialist
Andrew Carnegie, although I couldn’t find any evidence to back this up and it
was never confirmed by Barks.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wdus01.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3030" title="wdus01"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wdus01-300x216.jpg"
alt="" width="300" height="216" /></a>The first story in the volume is
<em>Only A Poor Old Man</em>, which was first published in March 1952, and
straight away we are presented with one of Scrooge’s signature moves,
swimming like a porpoise in his vast Money Bin. Scrooge is the richest person
in the Disney universe and his fortune is described in many ways. At the
start of this story it is ‘umpteen-centrifugilillion dollars’ but throughout
the book it is most commonly described as filling an area of ‘three cubic
acres’.

	Scrooge’s Scottish heritage is detailed in <em>The Horse-Radish
Treasure</em> from September 1953. In a flashback set in 1753 we see
Scrooge’s ancestor Captain Seafoam McDuck swindled in a deal to carry a chest
of horse-radish from Glasgow to Jamaica on his ship the Golden Goose. In real
life many shipping merchants made their fortunes sailing between Glasgow and
America in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. The Merchant City area of Glasgow
still betrays the fortunes of these nouveau riche traders with its grand
architecture. The neo-classical palace that today houses the Gallery of
Modern Art was originally the home of ‘<a
href="http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/History%201700-1830"
target="_blank">Tobacco Laird</a>’ William Cunninghame. The gallery’s vast
ground floor was once his ballroom.

	The tobacco trade was part of the trading route trading between Britain
and North America and the Caribbean, it later became a leg of the ‘triangular
trade’ when it connected with the slave trade from West Africa. In <a
href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Painting-The-Forth-Bridge-Scottish/dp/
1854106406" target="_blank"><em>Painting the Forth Bridge: A Search for
Scottish Identity</em></a>, Carl MacDougall claims that Glasgow’s love affair
with America dates back to these Tobacco Lords in the 1700s. A modern version
of this trans-Atlantic connection can be seen in the many artists in <a
href="http://classic.tcj.com/international/studio-profile-hope-street-studios
/" target="_blank">Hope Street studios</a> in Glasgow who are producing
superhero comics for Marvel and DC.

	Reading these comics for the first time I can appreciate the joy people
find in them. Scrooge is a self-made umpteen-centrifugilillionairre who is
always figuring out ways not to spend his money. The one-page gag strips are
some of my favourites as they cut straight to the heart of his character. On
finding out that a taxi starts the meter as soon as he enters the cab,
Scrooge pauses at the door, only climbing inside when the stop light changes
to green. In another short strip a beggar keeps asking for a dime for coffee
and eventually Scrooge relents but only because he can buy one for himself
and the second cup is free.

	This shows that he is not completely heartless and in the longer strip
<em>Back to the Klondike</em> we are introduced to Glittering Goldie, a woman
from Scrooge’s prospecting past and possible previous love interest. They
feud again and Scrooge decides to stage a competition with her to see who can
find his buried treasure of gold nuggets. When Goldie wins Scrooge blames his
failure on forgetting to take his memory medication, however Donald realises
that he didn’t forget but allowed Goldie to win. Although he would never
admit to it, Scrooge wanted to see this woman from his past escape her life
of destitution.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Scrooge-1.jpg"><img
class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3042" title="Scrooge 1"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Scrooge-1-300x225.jpg
" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Like other Disney staff Barks worked
anonymously until his identity was uncovered in the late 1950s, until then
fans knew him only as the Good Duck Artist and it’s easy to see why. His
anthropomorphic creatures are full of life and character, be they ducks, dogs
or pigs. I think my favourites are Scrooge’s nemeses the Beagle Boys who are
all completely identical and are only differentiated by the prison numbers on
their chests (see them on the book cover above). Some of the more fantastical
creatures are the denizens of the undersea world in <em>The Secret of
Atlantis</em>. The scaly green gilled human-fish are reminiscent of <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046876/" target="_blank"><em>The Creature
from the Black Lagoon</em></a>, which came out in cinemas the same year
(1954). I’d also wager that Mike Mignola had read that strip before coming up
with the character <a href="http://hellboy.wikia.com/wiki/Abraham_Sapien"
target="_blank">Abe Sapien</a> in <em>Hellboy</em>. <p style="text-align:
left;">The backgrounds are often wonderfully detailed, Atlantis, and the
whales that swim around it, are much more ‘realistically’ rendered than
Scrooge and Donald. Similarly the Shangri-la-esque village of Tralla La in
the strip of the same name is in a very detailed Himalayan mountain valley.
However, the yellow slant eyed ducks that live in Tralla La are a little
troublesome but perhaps just a product of the unenlightened politics of the
time. Strangely in this world of anthropomorphic ducks, dogs and pigs, the
creature that Scrooge ask for directions to the village appears to be
human.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><a

had initially intended to write about Norwegian cartoonist Jason and while I
enjoyed my brief foray into the world of Disney as drawn by Carl Barks, it is
the new Jason volume <a

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Jeffrey Brown’s latest
graphic novel, <a
href="http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog/a-matter-of-life/839"
target="_blank">A Matter Of Life</a>, is a first for him. After working in
simple, straight-to-pen black and white for many years, Brown has recently
begun working in colour, with the Transformers-esque <a
href="http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog/jeffrey-brown"
target="_blank">Incredible Change-Bots</a> and his two popular reimaginings
of Darth Vader as a father to little Luke and Leia, <a
href="http://www.amazon.ca/books/dp/145210655X" target="_blank">Darth Vader
and Son</a> and <a
href="http://www.amazon.ca/Vaders-Little-Princess-Jeffrey-Brown/dp/1452118698
/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1375765479&sr=1-2" target="_blank">Vader’s
Little Princess</a>. <em>A Matter Of Life</em>, however, is his first
autobiographical work in colour, and it is Brown’s autobiographical work that
made his name in comics, so it’s a welcome addition to his oeuvre.

	<em>A Matter Of Life</em> explores Brown’s relationship with his young
son, Oscar, as well as his relationship with his own father. This
relationship leads Brown to explore the significance of religion in his life,
as his father was a minister at their local church. Previous books such as
Little Things and Funny Misshapen Body hinted at tensions with his father and
religious childhood but always skirted around them, most likely for fear of
misrepresenting his family. The focus of Brown’s autobiographical work was
also on his romantic relationships previously, candidly depicting the graphic
sexual and emotional failures therein. His 2010 “B-sides” collection, <a
href="http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog/undeleted-scenes/712"
target="_blank">Undeleted Scenes</a>, did feature two shorter stories about
his son’s birth and subsequent hospital visits, but they were in black and
white and did not explore the emotional depth of the father-son bond. But
they felt like a progression: a growing maturity and graceful ageing of
Brown’s comics. With <em>A Matter Of Life</em> this progression has reached a
peak just as Brown is at the peak of his career, with a recent Eisner award
win under his belt. He has also earned the significant literary accolade of
being a New York Times Bestselling author, even if it is for his <em>Star
Wars</em>-related books and not his autobiographical ones.

	The book is episodic, bound together with a thematic rather than a
distinct linear narrative thread, but does not suffer for it. Brown
alternates between vignettes from his own childhood and Oscar’s, with the
young Jeffrey being involved in the church, believing in God and dealing with
guilt and the questioning his belief. Oscar, meanwhile, is not brought up
with religion being something he must follow without question – instead, we
see him asking his dad some difficult questions and discovering adult things,
such as his own mortality, which doesn’t seem to concern him too much, as he
tells his dad excitedly that he can “FIGHT dying!” There is a significant
contrast between young Jeff and young Oscar: Jeff grows up with shame, worry
and confusion, while Oscar always appears innocent, bright and optimistic: an
almost perfect child. The implication is that Jeff is a better parent for
bringing up his own son without the worries that were forced upon him and
being more open with Oscar about religion being his own decision; however,
this is never made explicit and is complicated and refuted significantly by
many of the stories which depict Jeff and his own dad together. We see them
enjoying pizza, taking a trip to New York together, and playing trains with
Oscar, free entirely from any of the resentment which Jeff could easily have
harboured due to the religious upbringing he rejected as an adult.

class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3061" /></a>

	The book could have been a bitter and bleak graphic novel, but is instead
full of warmth and humour, aided by the bright colour scheme. It is framed at
the beginning and end by splash pages which appear to have been painted
rather than drawn, and which depict stars and space in a much more abstract,
expressionistic style than Brown’s drawings. This framing reminds us that the
short stories in <em>A Matter Of Life</em> are just small moments in the
context both of Brown’s entire life and the vastness of the universe, but
that therein lies life itself – also an underlying theme in Brown’s <a
href="http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog/little-things/626"
target="_blank">Little Things</a>. His choice moments of family life paint a
picture of complex, but powerful love, and of a strong, sweet bond between
two generations of fathers and sons.

	The striking refinement and emotional intelligence of <em>A Matter Of
Life</em>, and Brown’s gradual development and new found maturity in this
book, is an apt metaphor for the development of comics as an art form. The
form has been sullied by accusations of a lack of narrative ambition and
childish, underdeveloped storytelling (part of the arguments of Frederic
Wertham and others which led to the founding of the Comics Code Authority),
and these accusations could well be made of Brown’s work. Although the raw,
underdeveloped art style and painful honesty first engaged me with Jeffrey
Brown’s work, I still have trouble refuting these accusations when  they’re
levelled at Brown’s early graphic novels.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Photo-05-08-2013-17-
33-33.png"><img

class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3062" /></a>

	Brown himself is aware of these criticisms, of course, and has made of
light of them throughout his career. The first page of his collection of
one-shots and strip cartoons, <a
href="http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog/i-am-going-to-be-small/527"
target="_blank">I Am Going To Be Small</a>, is a collection of dubious but
true “praise,” rewritten in Brown’s round, childish letters. According to
writer Warren Ellis, Brown’s works (which, at this point in his career, can
refer only to his relationship comics Clumsy and Unlikely) are “emotionally
about six years old,” while the Portland Mercury calls them “Pathetic losers’
nerd-porn as illustrated by a five-year-old.” And cutting though they are,
these words are easily backed up by a selection of almost any panels from
Brown’s first two books, which variously depict him crying on the phone to
his girlfriend, comforting his crying girlfriend as she expresses the belief
that she ruined his loss of virginity for him and having awkward,
uncomfortable sex.

	The same criticisms, however, could not be made of <em>A Matter Of
Life</em>. The art, whilst still simple, with varied lines and a cuteness
similar to that of his Top Shelf contemporaries James Kochalka, Craig
Thompson and Paul Hornschemeir, is refined, engaging and expertly rendered,
with straightforward colours and shading that sit well within Brown’s lines.
His Raymond Carver-esque microcosmic stories are literate, engaging
narratives which subtly expose emotion, depth and complexity. With this book,
Jeffrey Brown has truly come of age, whilst still retaining the simplicity,
humour and warmth of his earlier work.

Dumb</title> <link>http://www.graphixia.ca/2013/08/jason-turner/</link>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I wanted to order a
copy of Simon Moreton’s <em>Grand Gestures</em> for someone who had helped us
out tremendously with our Graphixia <em>Comics and the Multimodal World</em>
conference and was keen on Simon’s work. <em>Grand Gestures</em> is published
by <em>Retrofit,</em> Box Brown’s publishing outfit in Philadelphia. Because
sending all that way for a single comic book seemed foolish, I also ordered
Andrew White’s <em>We Will Remain</em> (his work has impressed me on the
<em>Comics Workbook</em> Tumblr), and I took a flyer on Jason Turner’s
<em>Farm School</em> because it looked interesting.

	When I learned that Turner is a Vancouver comics artist, the thought of
sending to Philadelphia to aquire the work of a local artist struck me as
funny. As I started digging and discovered that <em>True Loves</em> the comic
that Turner works on with his wife Manien Bothma was nominated for the “One
Book, One Vancouver” prize in 2007 and is recognized as a comic that is
quintessentially associated with Vancouver, I felt that if I knew anything
about comics I would already know Turner’s work. I had sent away to
Philadelphia to find out something about home and about my own ignorance.

	<em>Farm School</em> is a great example of “show, don’t tell” narrative
comics art. I suppose “post-apocalyptic” is the word everyone writing about
this book will use to describe it. The standard description of the book is a
“pastoral post-apocalyptic walking story” (which reminded me of Oliver East’s
work). But we know know little about the apocalypse that has caused the urban
environment, and the human society within it, to devolve into a ‘pastoral’
state. The traces of the modern world remain tantalizingly, in the bombed out
buildings and abandonned automobiles that the grass and trees encroach on.

	<a

><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3079" title="Farm School 001"

href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Farm-School-001.tiff
"> </a>

	The plot of the comic is essentially the returning of a book to the
library. The main character, Hester, emerges from the woods in contemporary
military dress with a deer that she has shot with a bow and arrow across her
back. Her mission is to go to the centre of the city, to the Crystal Palace,
that operates as an information hub, to get news of a relative. The Crystal
Palace is the only place that has computers, that can retrieve e-mail; it is
a post-apocalyptic telegraph office. Along the way, Hester drops off the deer
with her friend Mabel, who says she wishes Hester would return to the town
permanently from the woods and asks her to return a library book. When Hester
visits the bakery along her way, the baker also makes a request, asking her
to escort his daughter, Patricia, to town so she can deliver baguettes.
Presumably such a task involves some danger. This notion of a journey in
which the character picks up things and people along the way makes a sly nod
to the video-game tradition as well as the picaresque/romance/epic tradition.
But because <em>Farm School</em> is presented as a slice of life, everything
is low key. The epic battles are in the past, though danger always lurks in
the margins and ominous backgrounds.

	<em>Farm School</em>’s success as a comic depends on the interplay
between foreground and background in both images and narrative. The
backgrounds in the panels serve as evidence of a violent battle, as does
Hester’s military outfit. Meanwhile, in the foreground we see a buccolic,
perhaps even nostalgic, story of people carrying out simple functions of
human exchange. The farm school of the title is a place where people learn to
grow vegetables that they trade for things like bread.

	Turner’s philosophical focus in the comic is the overlay of exchange
networks: the way that the revived ‘old-fashioned’ network of exchanging
goods relates to our contemporary technological network of exchanging
information. The notion of traffic and intersection appears in the
totemization of a set of traffic lights slung over a tree. Hester makes sure
to leave tributes: Red for blood, gold for the sun and green for plants. This
moment both crystallizes Turner’s post- and pre-modern interplay and suggests
the arbitrariness of iconic signs.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Farm-School-002.jpg"
><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3081" title="Farm School 002"

956x1024.jpg" alt="" width="956" height="1024" /></a>

	The action climax of the narrative occurs when Hester fails to stop
Patricia from escaping town for the dangerous outlying area with a bunch of
her friends. She cannot overcome Patricia’s youthful free will. But the real
substance of the story lies in Hester’s refusal to live in the town–she
resides instead in the nearby woods–or sleep in a building. Obviously, Hester
has some sort of post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result of some battle,
perhaps a battle that led to the world looking the way that it does. Hester’s
anxiety about the world that surrounds her as she moves through her mundane
activities of the day has the feel of an autobiographical comic. So it’s not
surprising to learn that Jason Turner is well into autobiographical comics,
my favourite being <a

href="http://www.webcomicsnation.com/jasonturner/vancouver/series.php?view=
archive&amp;chapter=43465" target="_blank"><em>Year 40</em></a> that
documents living in Vancouver through the 2010 Winter Olympics.

	My response to <em>Farm School</em> was pretty much the diametrical
opposite to <a
title="http://madinkbeard.com/archives/every-comic-i-read-in-2013-february"
href="http://madinkbeard.com/archives/every-comic-i-read-in-2013-february"
target="_blank">Derik Badman</a>’s. That is, he dislikes it and I like it for
the same reasons. Here is what Badman says: <blockquote>Mostly I was just
bored. I’m not really sure what the point of the comic was. It wasn’t all
about the world building (the way Finder is at times), at least not enough to
be interesting on its own. It wasn’t really about the characters. It didn’t
have much of a plot. It wasn’t poetic or just aesthetically beautiful. It was
more like a part of something bigger that got hacked down to short comic
size. A lot of narrative comics seem to have that trouble, like people don’t
want to spend the time/effort to really do the narrative, or they can’t quite
edit out in a way to make it work, but they still want to tell a
story.</blockquote> What Badman sees as “hacked down,” I see as synecdochic,
as <em>Farm School</em> applies the narrative strategies of the slice of life
comic to the sci-fi apocalyptic comic, to create a neat hybrid. The point
here is not that Turner is “lazy” but that he is putting the viewer to work,
engaging him or her in the act of imagining what the artist leaves out. It’s
pretty clear early on that Turner is presenting a synecdoche of something,
and even if we cannot derive the whole clearly from this part, I for one was
pretty interested in trying. I guess the point of contention between Badman
and I on this comic is who should be doing what kind of work in the
producer/consumer network. Badman wants Turner to do more of the work that I
feel the viewer should be doing. I don’t necessarily think that either of us
is “correct”; we just have different aesthetic responses.

	Finally, I have to say that the quality of <em>Retrofit</em>’s books is
excellent, well-worth the five or six dollars you will spend on each. The
print quality is beautiful and the books are on lovely paper. My only qualm
is the absence of page numbers.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[This post evolved from
a central question: what can comics teach us about understanding the
internet? At this point, the internet, as we call that amorphous blob of
literary, visual, and audible content, has become untraceable. While the
origins can perhaps be tracked back to UCLA, Menlo Park and a few digital
bulletin boards, the narrative of its evolution has dissipated under a morass
of webpages catering to every possible niche, half-finished or unstarted
blogs, social sites, shifting design iterations, and the decline and fall of
once mighty aggregators such as AOL, MySpace, Delicious, and soon,
irrevocably, Pinterest (a comicbook if there ever was one), Twitter and
Facebook.

	Indeed, the history of the internet seems to find its genesis in ARPANET,
reductively a connection between two computers in two different places;
between Leonard Kleinrock and Douglas Engelbart. Themselves of immigrant, and
mixed racial heritage, their position at the forefront of the
&#8220;invention&#8221; of the internet rhymes with the mythologies around
Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, who of course gave us <em>Superman</em>. In
fact, the genesis mythology surrounding two guys collaborating and making
connections others have missed is an important part of the current
understanding of the internet and those who work within digital culture. Two
guys in a garage started Apple and a fourteen year-old kid started Microsoft.
The story of the internet, like that of comics, is often infused with DIY
ethics and collaborations between excluded geniuses with unique, but
unrecognized, talents.

	The internet&#8217;s untraceable and evolving birth has links with both
the evolving and constantly shifting origin myths of comics and the very
nature of the medium of comics with its multiple storylines, character
versions, and alternative sequences. Even the porn industry&#8217;s
recognition of the possibilities for the internet is mimicked in the Tijuana
Bibles of early comics &#8211; though perhaps not quite so publicly. Suffice
to say, as it is impossible to run a straight line through the multiple
iterations of <em>Superman</em> or <em>Batman</em> or <em>Spiderman</em> or
<em>The X-Men</em>, it is impossible to say just how the internet has evolved
into what it is now.

	All this leads to how the coincidences between comics and the internet
suggest bigger things about origins and histories. Comics, like the internet,
seem to be in possession of an impossible archive. That is, there is simply
too much material, too many narratives, too many representations, to allow
for the careful accumulation and recording of what has been and gone. Comics
often thrive on the scarcity of their beginnings (bought issue #1 of
<em>Action Comics</em> lately?). At least comics save their iterations. The
internet simply overwrites them and leaves no trace, except perhaps in an
obscure line of code.

	That said, comics can teach us a lot about how to think about the
internet and in particular, its content. The structure of the internet is at
once a community and a private space. It involves, as comics so often do, a
place where many people gather, but also a space where we encounter things on
our own, obscured from the view of others - a flashlight under the covers. We
are connected in the sense that we are looking at similar things, most of the
time, but we are disconnected in the sense that we tend to experience them on
our own, away from the crowd. While we might venture down to the comic shop
on Wednesdays to see what&#8217;s up with others coming in for the weekly
releases, we don&#8217;t read comics together - we read them alone.

	The content of the internet, organized as it is in a series of boxes (or
.divs for the coders in the crowd) reflects the organization of the comic
with its connected images and directed text &#8211; even the hyperlink
suggests the ever present &#8220;*check Hulk #13 for back story, ed.&#8221;
in the narration box of comics that links us back to other stories. Comics
are also one giant linked story; some would argue that all Superheroes follow
the tropes established in <em>Superman</em>, no matter the obvious
deviations. In short, everything in comics suggests a link to something else
&#8211; story, artist, place, golden age, silver age, yellow press, mass
consumption, character, censorship, youth, buying power, coming of age, war,
racism, violence, sex, on and on it goes. Comics, if we could throw every
issue ever in one room, reflect the linkages that make the internet what it
is; the internet doesn&#8217;t just look like comics do, it&#8217;s organized
around the same iterative principles that seem to govern the internet &#8211;
we cannot hope to collect it all.

	This is but a small snapshot of some of the coincidences between comics
and the internet. The ease with which comics seem to have transitioned onto
digital media suggests these coincidences may have other properties to do
with similar audiences, similar structures, similar creative practices. One
thing is for sure, the internet and our interpretation of it has a lot to
learn from comics and comicbook collectors who manage an immense body of
production (Scott had to <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2012/06/19/74-synaesthesia-and-nostalgia
-comics-as-ephemera/" target="_blank">consult a structural engineer</a>). The
internet might also be the endgame that shows precisely and definitively how
comics have become entrenched in models for cultural production in the Twenty
First Century. ]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I know I've given a lot
of column inches (pixel widths?) to Bryan Lee O'Malley's staggeringly popular
and totally wonderful <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> series.  I posted about it <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2011/08/30/38-scott-pilgrim-world-1-
level-1-book-1-canadian-eh/">here</a>, and <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2011/09/26/41-scott-pilgrim-episode-2-
manic-pixie-dream-girl/">here</a>, and then also <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2011/10/24/45-scott-pilgrim-again-
masculinity-and-fighting-and-gayness-and-such/">here</a>, and then <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2012/11/21/94-graphixia-videoblogs-
comics-forum-2012/">Peter and I travelled to Leeds</a> to talk about it some
more (and then <a
href="http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/news/pressreleases/name,14828,en.
html">I gave another talk</a> [at least partly] about it in Wales).  2012 was
sort of the Year of Scott Pilgrim for me.

	<img class="alignleft"
src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/08/Lost_At_Sea.gif" alt=""
width="250" height="375" />You'd think I'd be out of stuff to say about
O'Malley's oeuvre!  But I've been prepping for my new semester and have been
spending a lot of time with his first comic, <em>Lost at Sea</em>, which I am
teaching this year in my first-year literature course.  I typically theme
this course around coming-of-age and gender and trauma, and <em>Lost at
Sea</em> fits this thematic niche perfectly.  A slice of life narrative
without a superheroic overlay, this first comic is far darker and more bleak
than the <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> series.  Where Scott's battles are clear and
his path to victory obvious, Raleigh of <em>Lost at Sea</em> is battling
internal demons, and her chance of success is not at all inevitable.

	O'Malley's ability to deal with emotion in a nuanced and complicated way
surprised me when I first read this particular comic, especially since an
obvious criticism of <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> is the inherent lack of emotional
nuance.  In <em>Lost at</em> Sea,<em> </em>Raleigh is depressed -- deeply
depressed, really -- and O'Malley employs effective use of empty space, black
space, and a kind of shaky hand-lettered quality to evoke this for the
reader.  Raleigh's emotional world is difficult to navigate (she's a teenage
girl, after all, and O'Malley resists the infuriating adult urge to make
adolescence make sense when viewed in retrospect) but deeply and thoughtfully
constructed. But it's a text-heavy narrative, especially considering that
O'Malley is a cartoonist first (as opposed to authors who fall backwards into
comics and whose reliance on text is perhaps more predictable); at first
glance, text dominates many panels and indeed whole pages.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/lost-at-sea-2.jpg"><
img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3103" title="lost-at-sea-2"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/lost-at-sea-2.jpg"
alt="" width="500" height="368" /></a>But what O'Malley does here that is
interesting is use images and text to tell parallel and complementary, but
not identical, stories.  In the panel to the right, for example, Raleigh's
thoughts are (as they often are) entirely internalized; she is focused not on
the events of the moment, but on her ability to experience them effectively.
 At the same time, O'Malley illustrates what Raleigh seems to be missing in
the real world around her. The images in the comic serve to underscore
Raleigh's biggest liability -- that she lives wholly inside her head.
 Instead of the heavy use of text indicating an early-career reliance on
traditional narrative storytelling, O'Malley is engaged in a tremendously
sophisticated comic strategy by assigning different tasks to the text and the
imagery.  (As an aside, I'm interested to see what students do with this, as
it requires a lot of cognitive work to knit the two together in a way that
makes sense).

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/
tumblr_m9comq46or1qzqao6o1_500.png"><img class="alignleft size-full
wp-image-3105" title="tumblr_m9comq46or1qzqao6o1_500"

tumblr_m9comq46or1qzqao6o1_500.png" alt="" width="500" height="498"
/></a>O'Malley also weaves a long-running metaphor through <em>Lost at
Sea</em> involving cats.  Raleigh is allergic to cats.  Raleigh was once
attacked by a cat in a life she barely remembers before her parents' divorce.
 Raleigh sees cats and hears meowing everywhere.  Raleigh finds cats
inexplicable attracted to her.  Raleigh believes a cat has her soul.  Cats,
cats, cats, indeed.  They represent an easy way to categorize Raleigh's
disconnection from people around her -- her soullessness renders her
non-human, and thus excuses her inability to interact, and allows her to
triangulate her ability to connect through, for example, the stray cats her
friends collect for her in an attempt to locate her soul.  And Raleigh's
dislike of cats and her allergy to them keeps her clearly distanced from her
own emotional world, even as she lives entirely in her head, because she
cannot make contact with this essential part of herself.

	The cat metaphor is not always successful; there are times when it seems
to be overdone and many times, like when Raleigh encounters a gift shop full
of stuffed cats, where any meaningful connection to its larger metaphorical
meaning seems difficult to unravel.  And unfortunately, it seems to drop from
the text without resolution in favour of stars and open skies as a way to
conceive of the future.  But when O'Malley makes use of cats and their
manifestation as representatives of Raleigh's mental state, it's effective
and thoughtful.

	Fans of <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> are eagerly anticipating <em>Seconds</em>,
O'Malley's follow-up comic to be published next year.  I'm hoping that we'll
see a combination of the breadth and scope of <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> with the
depth and emotional complexity of <em>Lost at Sea.</em>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I really loved Lost at Sea, and for very
different reasons than I loved Scott Pilgrim.

	I loved the drifting away-ness of its motifs, that not every loose end
got tied up. I also enjoyed our (the readers') role as Stillman (what a great
name!), the object to whom the entire narrative is dictated. That's what I
focused on in my review
(http://andalittlewine.blogspot.com/2012/01/book-3-of-52-lost-at-sea.html).

	It's interesting that before reading this book (and discussing it with my
wife) I'd never heard the myth that cats steal souls.

	I thought some of the things Raleigh reported to us about the number of
cats she came into contact with suggested an unreliable narrator. Not sure
it's an angle worth pursuing for your class, but I'd be interested if any
other readers had that impression.]]></wp:comment_content>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[As a librarian in a
predominantly international college, I’m often tasked with the doubly
challenging problem of trying to get our student body, mostly in their late
teens / early twenties, to read co-curricular texts both for recreational
purposes and for research to ultimately wind up in their essays. When asking
them what they’re interested in for my semesterly book order, I’m typically
met with blank stares – firstly, recreational reading in a language they’re
just coming to terms with is challenging enough. Moreover, they’re twenty, so
the idea of reading anything of length in any language is generally anathema
to where they’re at in their lives. <p class="MsoNormal">Enter the graphic
novel. I’ve recently built up our collection to include classics such as <em
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Sandman</em>, <em
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Watchmen</em>, <em
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Dark Knight Returns</em> and the like
(and yes, Brenna, I just bought and catalogued all six <em
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Scott Pilgrim</em> books). Moreover,
based on student recommendations I’ve purchased several manga texts, from <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Cover.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3114" title="Escape_Cover.indd"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Cover-209x300.jpg"
alt="" width="209" height="300" /></a>Doraemon to Fullmetal Alchemist to
Naruto, all of which have been flying off the shelves. As we’ve gone over at
length on Graphixia (and as what could be considered the founding principle
argument of the site), there’s something compelling about words juxtaposed
with images that acts as a gateway for reading and literary analysis, making
graphic narratives a useful inclusion in any academic space. I was still
stuck, however, when it came to secondary research material for classroom
projects and essays, until I was recommended an excellent (and locally
produced by Vancouver's own Arsenal Pulp) text by one of our History
instructors, serendipitously on a topic that jibes quite well with our
particular group of students.</p> <p class="MsoNormal"><em
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Escape to Gold Mountain</em>, written
and drawn by David H.T. Wong, is a pseudo-historical account of several
generations of a Chinese family who made their way to Canada during the
nineteenth century and the trials that they faced while establishing a place
in their new world – “Gold Mountain,” in Chinese <em
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Gam Saan</em>, was their name for North
America. A little like Forrest Gump, the text oscillates between relating
real historical people (e.g. Sun Yat Sen, Emily Carr) and events
contextualized through the emotional responses of fictional characters who
lived through them, in this case literally putting faces on the travesties of
exclu<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gamsaan03.jpg"><img
class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3117" title="gamsaan03"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gamsaan03-300x219.jpg
" alt="" width="300" height="219" /></a></em>sion, abuse, exploitation and
sometimes wholesale slaughter of early Asian migrants to Canada and the
United States. Throughout the narrative, we are presented with the
construction of the railway, facsimiles of posters meant to engender hatred
towards the Chinese, quotations from interviews and historical documents such
as America’s 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act (and Canada’s own 1923 Chinese
Immigration Act) and genuine, cited accounts of the atrocities committed over
the past two centuries. Covering information ranging from the establishment
of the Head Tax (along with its particulars) all the way through to Canada’s
very recent <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">mea culpa</em> for the
blatant racism in the nation’s collective past, the text makes for a highly
useful and practical summative reading of the adversity that Chinese
Canadians have faced over the years – a very useful inclusion in any history
class.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">But such textbo<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gamsaan01.jpg"><img
class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3115" title="gamsaan01"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gamsaan01-202x300.jpg
" alt="" width="202" height="300" /></a>oks already exist, albeit in regular,
words without pictures format. Why choose to offer this information as a
graphic novel? What is compelling about Wong’s work is not only the emotional
family story that is interwoven throughout its historical accounts, but the
fact that through the detailed architecture of the cityscapes, the anguish on
his character’s faces, the sheer scope of the projects undertaken by migrant
workers presented visually we are far more bound to the history than simple
text can allow for. It is hardly an easy text, packed with detailed
information throughout, but like a good historical film the visual nature of
its expression situates the past within the present and makes the characters
and events accessible from both an academic as well as a personal
perspective. When the destruction of Nanking in 1937 is discussed, it is
framed through one of the novel’s several protagonists, Gee-Mun, who is
denied the right to bring his family into Canada because of the Immigration
Act. Seeing the horror in his expression, the blackened panels as he prays
for their safety (and ultimately learns of their deaths), Wong takes every
advantage of the medium to allow us to experience the real, ontological
history of the e<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gamsaan02.jpg"><img
class="alignright  wp-image-3116" title="gamsaan02"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gamsaan02.jpg" alt=""
width="356" height="521" /></a>vent as expressed through the sympathy we bear
for these characters. <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Escape to Gold
Mountain</em> is rife with these moments of history juxtaposed with personal
suffering, and manifested visually, it literally draws us in to the cultural
moment. As Imogene Lim notes, “this format allows the reader to visualize
individuals as … your relatives, your neighbors … there are no caricatures of
the slant-eyed, buck toothed, or conical hatted individuals that have been
frequently used to stereotype Asians; in Wong’s drawings we see real people”
(14).</p> <p class="MsoNormal">The history of race relations in Canada, as it
is everywhere, is already graphic in nature – it is violent, fraught with
suffering and tragedy, and is typically glossed by way of apologias and
modern revisions to government policies that seem to speciously negate any
explorations of the troubling nature of the West’s collective past.
Presenting such a controversial subject in this medium does double service to
its topic in that provides an entrypoint for those new to the history (or
even to those new to reading in English), while it also recontextualizes the
static, sedate details of historical documents for those overly familiar with
the subject already. In any other medium, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal;">Escape to Gold <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gold.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3118" title="gold"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gold-300x268.jpg"
alt="" width="300" height="268" /></a>Mountain</em> would be categorized as
historical fiction. In comics, we don’t see many of these types of texts that
straddle the academic and the personal (though Lutes’ <em
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Berlin</em> is an excellent example of
the form), so it allows for a humanizing of the subject without a typical
categorization of “fiction” that would mark it as unfit for scholarly
research (a nerdy librarian sidenote: its Library of Congress call number
begins with FC instead of PN, placing it on the Canadian History shelf
instead of beside Graphic Novels). The text is a hybrid, containing fictional
characters while being well referenced and endnoted for those wishing to
either validate its claims or pursue further study, and more than any other
text I’ve encountered shows what the graphic novel is capable of in terms of
reaching outside of the English department to complement research in other
disciplines. <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Escape to Gold
Mountain</em> has certainly found a welcome home on my library’s shelves, and
I can only hope that more graphic novels demonstrating a similar willingness
to defy expectations of traditional History textbooks will follow in its
wake. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal">Work

<title>#133 - Alienated by the Strip: Daniel Clowes’s Comic-Strip Novel Ice
Haven</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[In only 89 pages,
Daniel Clowes’ <em>Ice Haven</em> (2005) hosts a remarkable cast of
characters with about 14 central protagonists, each in turn given  close
attention. What binds them all together is the backdrop against which their
lives are set, the fictional small town called Ice Haven, and the dramatic
event that set it in turmoil: the kidnapping of David Goldberg. Albeit
functioning as the backbone of the book, this criminal case is quickly
overtaken by the thoughts and everyday lives of the manifold characters.

	Each character is given his own comic strip, a structure Clowes borrows
from the Sunday comics pages: “I started reading old Sunday newspapers to get
inspiration, and I realized what a great thing it would be if the characters
from each comic strip kind of had something to do with each other, even
though they are done in completely different styles” (Clowes qtd. in Guilbert
2009). Clowes uses comic strips as building blocks for the larger narrative
structure of his graphic novel.

	The cover of the 2005 book format advertises <em>Ice Haven</em> as a
‘comic-strip novel’. This paratextual self-definition is something of an
oxymoron. With their short form, comic strips build towards a comic
climax--usually a gag or slapstick--and do not generally share the kind of
development and narrative complexity that is expected from graphic novels,
which rather put a particular emphasis on the storytelling. Moreover, comic
strips have been and still are “an editorially conservative medium, bound by
inflexible formatting constraints” (Hatfield 2005: 4). According to Hatfield,
the formal constraints of the comic strip have impeded it from realizing the
kind of groundbreaking innovations witnessed in book-length alternative
comics (2005: 3).

	Quite paradoxically, Clowes is trying to use the very formal constraints
of the comic strip to address thematic concerns typical of alt comics. In
this regard, Peter Sattler recently remarked that “[Clowes’s] work goes out
of its way to thematize the artist’s and/or the story’s struggle against
comics themselves – against a form that, as Clowes presents it, seems unable
to encompass interior states, unable to escape its own theatricality and
artificiality, unable to circumvent its own closed system of beginnings and
endings, set-ups and punch-lines” (Sattler qtd. in Berlatsky 2013). Sattler
further touches on <em>Wilson</em> (2010) and the rigid structure of the
one-page gag that stands in the way of its thematic ambition.

	In <em>Ice Haven</em>, however, Clowes’ struggle against the limits of
the comic strip serves the thematic concerns of the larger narrative: instead
of being an obstacle to the representation of interior states, they
contribute in depicting loneliness. The format indeed participates in
harboring a feeling of alienation and disconnection so typical of Clowes’s
oeuvre. As Xavier Guilbert notices, “the isolation of the self-centered
characters is reinforced by the comic-strip structure of the story, confining
each individual to his or her own understanding of the world, prisoner of his
or her own space even in the seldom moments when their paths cross” (Guilbert
2006; my translation).

	Clowes draws on a variety of styles and genres to underpin the
individuality of each comic strip, turning the characters into the
(anti)heroes of their own story.  An interesting example is Clowes’ take on
romance comics in the segments casting an egocentric teenager named Violet
Vanderplatz. Here Clowes struggles against the melodramatic tone that
undercuts his representation of Violet’s psychological torments. This
unavoidable sense of "theatricality and artificiality" seems nonetheless to
be issued from Violet herself, who stages her own life as a romance comic and
consequently confronts the clichés of the genre.

	While the comic-strip structure traps the characters into their own
interior world, the larger narrative unity of the ‘novel’ binds them together
around the communal experience of the disappearance of David Goldberg and the
collective relief of his release. All the characters basically share the same
reality, appear on the same stage, but the reader’s access to that reality is
unavoidably mediated by a specific viewpoint.

	From the interplay of the various comic strips arises a polyphonic
narrative, a juxtaposition of different subjective instances. What the
juxtaposition of the various viewpoints in <em>Ice Haven</em> reveals is that
one cannot escape from his or her own subjective position and understanding
of the world. The rare attempts at communication are constantly thwarted by
misinterpretation.

	The would-be writer Vida, for instance, is a great admirer of the unknown
and frustrated poet Random Wilder, and tries to catch his attention by giving
him a zine she has written. Wilder is overwhelmed by its quality and
consequently loses every bit of his own artistic ambitions. He is so
disheartened that he “can’t bear to have it in the house” and tosses it in
the garbage, through which Vida later rummages. The discovery of her own zine
leads her to think that he found it completely worthless, and as a result she
drops her own literary dreams.

src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ice_haven_01.jpg"
alt="" width="813" height="298" /></a>

	The interplay of both viewpoints highlights the missed connexion between
two otherwise like-minded persons. While the reader benefits from an
"objective" overall perspective because he is able to juxtapose different
viewpoints, the characters remain enclosed in their comic strips.

	In <em>Ice Haven</em>, the constraints of the comic strip are used to
underpin the theme of alienation and disconnection; the comic strip does not
resist the representation of interior states, on the contrary, it defines it.
Yet, Sattler is right: here again, the story is struggling against comics
themselves, as the characters cannot escape the boundaries of their inner
world, delineated by the rigid format of the comic strip.

pretty lucky this year having a job that allowed me to live in Edinburgh for
the summer. For the month of August this city becomes 100 square miles of
awesome. My particular favourite part this summer was the Book Festival which
takes place in Charlotte Square in a collection of tents of all shapes and
sizes and comes replete with a bar, a Spiegeltent, deckchairs and two
bookshops. It is basically my idea of paradise.</p> <p>This year’s Book
Festival included a special Comics themed strand ‘Stripped’ which brought
comics creators such as Neil Gaiman, Joe Sacco, Chris Ware, Posy Simmonds and
Hannah Berry to talk about their works. There were also several cabaret style
events held in the Spiegeltent. One such event was the reappearance of <a
title="Literary Death Match" href="http://www.literarydeathmatch.com"
target="_blank">Literary Death Match</a> in Edinburgh. In case you’re not
familiar with the concept, Literary Death Match is basically like a gameshow
but with extra added books, this one had a Graphic Novel theme (I know, I
know, it really is the best thing ever). Authors are invited to read extracts
from their work, and they are then judged on ‘Literary Merit’, ‘Performance’
and ‘Intangibles’ by a panel of judges that on this occasion consisted of
Neil Gaiman, Dawn O’Porter and Craig Silvey. A winner advances from each
round to take part in the final, which on this momentous night was a game of
Graphic Novel Pictionary. Honestly, if Literary Death Match comes to a town
even vaguely near you, make the effort to go and see it.</p> <p>But on with
the post… It is the winner of this little slice of tremendousness that I
would like to talk about this week. This convoluted opening was merely a long
and hyperactive way of telling you that I had (unfortunately) not heard of
Amy Mason before this night, and now she is one of my new favourite things.
Amy Mason’s <em>The Islanders</em> is the graphic novel that accompanies the
 so-called lo-fi musical she, and her ex Eddie Argos, wrote about their
teenage romance and holiday to the Isle of Wight. Amy performs the text while
Eddie and Jim Moray perform the music. The book contains the script, song
lyrics and illustrations by Steven Horry. It also contains a link to download
the songs so you can listen along as you read.</p> <p><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-

<p><em>The Islanders</em> is a relatively simple story, two teenagers fall in
love, one runs away to live with the other and they struggle along, not old
enough to know how to look after themselves, too much in love to always care.
Indeed this is one of the book’s great strengths, its evocation of young
love. I love the knowing but affectionate way in which Amy describes their
relationship. She manages to poke fun at their intensity without in any way
diminishing its importance. Amy’s description of the mix tapes they make one
another is one of my favourite passages from the book;</p> <p>“We made each
other mix-tape after mix-tape. ANGELICA, KENICKIE b-sides, CICCONE, BIS…
happy, upbeat, lo-fi songs that we could have written – about nonsense or
young people falling in <strong>LOVE.</strong></p> <p>The tapes had names.
‘<strong>AMY’S POP HITS’</strong> or <strong>‘EDDIE’S SPARKLE MIX’</strong>
but what we really meant was ‘Amy, <strong>LISTEN</strong> to these
<strong>SONGS </strong> and realize <strong>I LOVE YOU’</strong> and ‘Eddie,
let the <strong>SONGS</strong> on this tape <strong>CONVINCE</strong> you
that <strong>I AM AMAZING</strong> and agree to <strong>NEVER LEAVE
ME</strong>”.</p> <p>Meanwhile her description of what made her fall in love
with Eddie made me howl with laughter; “Eddie tells me he’s been on a journey
to a magical land, a place where Pez grows on trees. He’s taken a supply of
apples and gin to keep him going and received assistance from a friendly goat
to fight a MALICIOUS GOBLIN. So THIS is WHAT he’s LIKE. The letter tells me
ALL I NEED to KNOW From this point we are TOGETHER”.</p> <p>The central story
of this book, and a thread that holds it together, is the importance of
elsewhere to the young Amy and Eddie. To soothe the troubled Amy to sleep
Eddie incites her to imagine they are on a raft, away from their problems and
safe from everyone. When Amy gets a job in an advertising agency she is put
in charge of the ads for the Isle of Wight radio station, to her mind the
island is a placed filled with people “looking down, wide-eyed, at the sea,
while they hum nervously, listening to their wind up radios and weaving or
whittling, or whatever Island people do”. As her colleagues start to peel
away on their annual holidays, Amy starts to imagine that they might be the
kind of people that could go away on holiday, to this island where people
“have things to weave, things to whittle or whatever island people do…”. In
fact it is their trip to the Isle of Wight that proves the catalyst for their
eventual break up and their epiphany that they can move elsewhere, see other
things, have other jobs, love other people.</p> <p>Steven Horry’s
illustrations do a wonderful job of conveying quite how momentous a decision
it is for Amy who can rarely, according to her own confession, “get through a
full supermarket shop without having a nervous breakdown” to go on holiday
with Eddie. A full two page spread of the couple approaching the ferry to the
Isle of Wight is divided into four horizontal panels to convey their
indecision about running to make the ferry they are on the point of missing,
while the decision to print the first pages about their arrival on the island
in colour is a fantastic way to share with the reader the sensory overload
that Amy and Eddie are experiencing, contrasting sharply as it does with
their difficult home life.</p> <p><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-
17-at-20.45.30.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3150"
title="Hands The Islanders"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-
17-at-20.45.30.png" alt="" width="747" height="578" /></a></p> <p>The
narrative is interspersed with postcards sent by the older Eddie and Amy to
their younger selves, often witty, sometimes wistful and sad, these postcards
provide a neat summary of their relationship and their different takes on
this joint holiday. Amy cites one of her reasons for embarking on this
project her interest in the different ways in which she and Eddie remember
this holiday. Indeed she initially contacted him hoping he could fill in the
gaps in her patchy memories of the trip. Amy remembers a trip on a Galleon
ride at the island’s theme park as sending her into a flat panic as she
screamed and sobbed her way through it, in Eddie’s memories of the event “Amy
was crying with laughter the whole time. I haven’t seen her so happy in
ages”. These differences in their own memories of their holiday help flesh
out Amy and Eddie as characters within the book and bring to life their
younger selves for the reader.</p> <p>When they return from their holidays
Amy charts the swift downfall of their relationship, she and Eddie drift
further and further apart. Their arguments get worse, he proposes in the wake
of a row with a ring fashioned from tin foil. They run out of money and spend
Christmas Day in darkness, along in their flat, later she tries to break the
coffee table to use as fuel on the fire and they surround themselves with
friends and parties as they try to plug the holes in their relationship.</p>
<p><em>The Islanders</em> is one of the most poignant books I have read in
ages, it beautifully charts the rise and fall of young love and the way in
which it incorporates the various different narrative styles, song,
monologue, image, postcard, effectively creates a collage that reflects the
patchwork of memories that Amy and Eddie have cobbled together of this period
in their lives.</p> <p><a

White, Raw Power 2 - Josh Bayer, Grand Gestures - Simon Moreton[/caption]

	Retrofit Comics come in a variety of sizes and paper stocks to suit the
individual author. <a href="http://smoo.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Simon
Moreton</a>’s minimalist <em>Grand Gestures</em> is slightly smaller than
standard comic book size and comes with a matt two-colour cover. <em>We Will
Remain</em> by <a href="http://whitecomics.tumblr.com/"
target="_blank">Andrew White</a> is slightly smaller with a full colour yet
muted cover, while <a href="http://joshbayerart.blogspot.co.uk/"
target="_blank">Josh Bayer</a>’s magazine sized <em>Raw Power 2</em> has a
garish day-glo glossy cover and is printed on newsprint, bringing to mind
comics like Peter Bagge’s Neat Stuff and punk fanzine Maximum Rocknroll.

	Forsman, a graduate of <a href="http://www.cartoonstudies.org/"
target="_blank">The Centre for Cartoon Studies</a> in Vermont, publishes Oily
Comics in that quarter letter size fanzine format that makes each book
exciting to grab a hold of and flick through the photocopied pages. There is
always a danger of a paper cut or roughly cut edges. The bluntness of the
Oily guillotine only adding to the materiality of these ephemeral little
booklets. Opening an envelope from Oily is always intriguing as I’m never
sure who will be featured; among my favourites so far are <em>Outside</em> by
<a href="http://oilyboutique.bigcartel.com/product/outside-2-3"
target="_blank">Marc Geddes</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.craghead.com/"
target="_blank">Warren Craghead</a>, <em>Lou</em> by <a
href="http://www.mmmendes.com/" target="_blank">Melissa Mendes</a>, and <a
href="http://joshuahallsimmons.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Josh
Simmons</a>’ <em>Training</em>.

	These comics are available in comics shops but, living in Scotland they
are hard to find, so I have subscriptions to both publishers ensuring regular
letterbox drops of comics. The internet and online payment companies make
ordering small press comics from around the world very, very simple - using
modern technology to get a fix of good old fashioned printed paper.
Interestingly both publishers also release digital versions of their comics,
although with Retrofit, I think only as an addition to the print
subscription. <p dir="ltr">The materiality is nothing though if the contents
are not up to scratch and so far neither publisher has disappointed, I may
like some comics more than others but they are always interesting. Perhaps
the most successful book so far is Forsman’s own <a
href="http://oilyboutique.bigcartel.com/category/teotfw"
target="_blank"><em>The End Of The Fucking World</em> </a>or <em>TEOTFW</em>.
Described on the cover as a blend of <em>Bonnie and Clyde</em> and
<em>Paranoid Park</em>, the minimally drawn tale mixes nihilistic teenage
boredom and crime, and looks to me like Terrence Malick’s <em>Badlands</em>
starring the cast of <em>Peanuts</em>.</p>

and thankfully they haven’t messed with the format too much. The complete
edition is only about 10% larger than the original minis - still no bigger
than my hands. Being published by Fantagraphics feels like the mainstream
these days but <em>TEOTFW</em> has broken through even further; it was
recently <a href="http://blog.film4.com/film4-0-announce-new-films/"
target="_blank">announced</a> that the book is being made into a series of
internet shorts by the British broadcaster Film4.0.</p> These are exciting
times for small press comics, and this is being marked by Comics Forum with
their <a href="http://comicsforum.org/comics-forum-2013/"
target="_blank">Small Press and Undergrounds: A Conference on Comics</a> in
Leeds, UK in November. Graphixia will be in attendance to host a panel
discussing the work we have achieved so far, such as this blog and our
successful <a

The panel is titled <em>Small is the New Big: The Comics Criticism Blog as

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="LEFT"><span
style="font-family: 'Fight For Our Love';"><span>This article will be in the
form of a beefed-out top five list, so each item is a paragraph. Homestuck is
in no way mine, it belongs to (the amazing) Andrew Hussie. You can find
<em>Homestuck</em> at <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/"
target="_blank">mspaintadventures.com</a>. Without further ado, let's get
started!</span></span></p> <p align="LEFT"><span style="font-family: 'Fight
For Our Love';"><span>Reason five: the little kid population of earth. Five
year olds are at an age where they can't search the internet on their own.
However, they can pick out their own books. Just picture this: a five year
old is looking through their Elementary School library. (up to grade seven,
so yes <em>Homestuck</em> could be here. <em><a
href="http://www.goodreads.com/series/43768-the-princess-diaries"
target="_blank">The Princess Diaries</a></em> and <em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Sisterhood-Traveling-Pants-Book-1/dp/0385730586"
target="_blank">Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants</a></em> are decidedly
more mature and they're in my school library.) Their eye is caught by a
brightly-coloured illustration of, say, <a
href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=nepeta+homestuck+cosplay&es_sm=119&tbm=
isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=KwRNUtX8JsbUyQG6k4HoBQ&ved=0CC4QsAQ&biw=1279&
bih=609&dpr=1" target="_blank">Nepeta</a>, the adorable cat-troll on the
front of a <em>Homestuck</em> book which the school librarian didn't read and
decided couldn't possibly be mature. They take the book out and as soon as
they open it are confronted by a world of swearing, violence, and complicated
concepts. Plus they will be deeply disturbed by buckets for the rest of their
life and the sand castle stage will be cut short. They will also see some of
the more creepy characters and scream when they see someone who looks a
little like them. (Which I guess probably wouldn't happen though, because you
don't exactly see someone with gray skin and a zodiac sign on their shirt
walking down Commercial Drive.) Their writing skills may also be deeply
impacted in an attempt to wriite liike 2ollux or 2omethiing, two. Or, to a
lesser extent, <a
href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=KARKAT&es_sm=119&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=
univ&sa=X&ei=lQRNUvaAA5HUyQGEjoCQDQ&ved=0CDsQsAQ&biw=1279&bih=609&dpr=1"
target="_blank">KARKAT</a> or <a
href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=GaMzee&es_sm=119&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=
univ&sa=X&ei=sQRNUom_O-qEygGI34H4Dg&ved=0CDsQsAQ&biw=1279&bih=609&dpr=1"
target="_blank">GaMzEe</a>. :33 &gt; Or to a similar extent as Sollux,
Nepeta. OR T3R3Z1. Okay, that's enough. It also has puns they wouldn't
understand (even I had to look up some of them on <a
href="http://mspaintadventures.wikia.com/wiki/MS_Paint_Adventures_Wiki"
target="_blank">MSPA wiki</a> before I got them), such as Karkat's trollian
handle, <a href="http://mspaintadventures.wikia.com/wiki/Karkat_Vantas"
target="_blank">carcinoGenetecist</a>, which is a pun and not just weird
because he represents the zodiac sign Cancer, which is also my zodiac sign,
thus the most awesome.</span></span></p> <p align="LEFT"><span
style="font-family: 'Fight For Our Love';"><span>Reason four: the style. The
style <em>Homestuck</em> is written in would just be a little weird. Due to
its “mock game” format, it would most likely be considered a picture book
instead of a comic, which it definitely isn't. It's a comic. A teenager
comic. And there are <a
href="http://www.amazon.ca/All-My-Friends-Are-Dead/dp/0811874559"
target="_blank">no teenager picture books</a>. I can't really write more on
the subject, so here's the first page as an example.</span></span></p> <p

width="298" height="300" /></a></p> <p align="LEFT"><span style="font-family:
'Fight For Our Love';"><span>See? That would be kind of weird as a paper
comic page.</span></span></p> <p align="LEFT"><span style="font-family:
'Fight For Our Love';"><span>Reason three: the copyright deal.
<em>Homestuck</em> uses several trademarked items. The <a
href="https://twitter.com/andrewhussie" target="_blank">Amazing Andrew
Hussie</a> might be sued if he made profit off it, we wouldn't want that
happening. Especially seeing as it's not just casually mentioning them, and
the story just wouldn't be the same without John’s deep hatred of Betty
Crocker or the Wayward Vagabond's obsession with <a
href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=Tab+soda&es_sm=119&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source
=univ&sa=X&ei=RwVNUvriLseEyAGlnYDQBQ&ved=0CD4QsAQ&biw=1279&bih=609&dpr=1"
target="_blank">Tab soda</a>.</span></span></p> <p align="LEFT"><span
style="font-family: 'Fight For Our Love';"><span>Reason two: music.
<em>Homestuck</em> is a very complete and high-tech webcomic. It includes
music. Awesome music. Such as my favourite track, Ohgodwhat. I also like the
Ohgodwhat remix. But this isn't about my taste in music. It's about how
<em>Homestuck</em> just wouldn't be the same without it.</span></span></p> <p
align="LEFT"><span style="font-family: 'Fight For Our Love';"><span>Reason
one: flash animation. Homestuck is also complete with dramatic, amazing,
rainbowly colourful flash animations. They are just one more thing to thank
Hussie for. They are in every way beautiful. I would put one here, however I
am writing this on <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/"
target="_blank">OpenOffice</a>, which I'm pretty sure can't have flash
animations inserted into it.</span></span></p> <p align="LEFT"><span
style="font-family: 'Fight For Our Love';"><span>I hope you enjoy and
understand! ~Sophie</span></span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Sophie-- I enjoyed the article.  I did wonder
what you thought about the print volumes of Homestuck that Hussie has
published.  I haven't read them myself, but I remain very curious about how
well they work (or don't work!). Some webcomics can very easily be translated
to print, especially if they're essentially just .jpg versions of a comic
book page or newspaper strip, but as you said, Homestuck is quite different!
It seems to me that the reader's action of clicking to move the story forward
is very central to the way that Homestuck works, and that the experience
would be wholly different if the panels were flattened down onto a page.  I'm
quite curious about this; I think I've nearly talked myself into ordering one
of the books now!]]></wp:comment_content>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have a hard time
writing about things I don’t like. I’m not that kind of critic. I’d much
rather explain how something works than what I dislike about it. So when
David said that our next Graphixia topic should be “things we hate,” I
balked.

	When I write about what I don’t like I feel like a jerk, and as if to
compund that feeling, someone always chimes in to say how I am misguided, if
not dead wrong. Furthermore, from teaching and parenting, I’ve learned that
it’s counterproductive to tell students and kids that what they like stinks.
If you want to listen to Taylor Swift or Owl City, go ahead; just because
it’s not my cup of tea shouldn’t prevent your enjoyment. And when it comes to
comics, fans of such a maligned medium ought to hesitate before dismissing
examples of it as lacking quality.

	The thing is, taste connects the subjective and the universal. This is
what Kant was on about when he said there was a bridge between moral and
aesthetic judgment, having to do with the categorical imperative. That is,
when we decide that something is “right” or “beautiful” we can only do so by
asking ourselves whether it is “right” or “beautiful” for everyone else as
well. This step in judgement is how we know we aren’t being perverse or
self-interested. It is important to remember that the imperative is on us as
judges not on other people. They don’t have to agree with us; the reflection
is simply a check on our own judgment.

	When we share our tastes with someone else, it is an invitation, not an
imperative. If I tell someone that this book, song, comic, work of art is
beautiful, it is an invitation for them to like it too. They aren’t obliged
to like it; they can say no thank you, I’m not fond of that, the same way
they might talk about eggplant. Most conflagrations on the internet over
whether something is good are bad seem to me to arise out of
misunderstandings of aesthetic imperatives and invitations.

	So when I discuss “hating” the kind of comic art I am about to discuss,
I’m aware that others might like it, and I’m also aware that what I hate
about it is as much about me as about the art. So, to get to the point, what
I hate is overly-saturated art in comics, by which I mean art that is glossy,
detailed, and ornately coloured, almost “photographic” in its appearance. The
reason I hate it is because it strikes me that in adding too much detail it
takes away from the key virtue of comic art: the way it conveys information
(aesthetic and otherwise) by stripping away detail. Archaeologists draw what
they find rather than photograph it (or as well as photographing it) because
the photograph presents too much information at the expense of the specific
information the archeologist wants to convey. The photograph lacks a certain
discrimination. Comics function according to the same principle.

	To be correct and fair, the problem I am referring to in comics stems
more from colouring the art rather than the line drawing itself, and possibly
has to do with the use of computers in the colouring process. I have nothing
against the use of computers in artwork but they do allow for doing things
because you <em>can</em> do them rather than because you <em>should</em>.

	The example that made me think of this hatred is <em>Mind the Gap</em>,
an Image series written by Jim McCann and drawn by Rodin Esquejo. I actually
find the series engaging, on a narrative level: the main character has been
attacked at a subway station and is in a coma. She finds herself inhabiting a
kind of limbo between life and death, a limbo defined by a house and a cast
of characters. She is able to look down on her hospital bed to see the
actions of her family and friends, and even inhabit the bodies of other
patients in the hospital.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Hate-001.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3215" alt="Hate 001"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Hate-001.png"
width="768" height="1024" /></a>

	It’s a neat conceit, spoiled by the “too muchness” of the art, which to
me is like overly-produced music. One of the reason I like comics is the
medium’s rawness: the need to produce so many pictures to fill so many pages
lends itself to a rough an ready feel that I find engaging. When a comic
lacks that feel, it is as if we are moving into another medium. The
phenomenon reminds me of a review I read of Stiff Little Fingers’ album
<em>Go For It</em> many years ago, the gist of which was, it’s a shame a punk
band doesn’t necessarily get better when they become more proficient with
their instruments.

	I also find that art like this detracts from rather than enhances the
multimodal aspect of comics. True, we are still dealing with words and
images, but because the art is so saturated, the embedding of other comics
features such as signs and labels gets left out.

	At the other end of the spectrum, consider the work of Brandon Graham who
makes every page a jam-packed collection of embedded text and images.
Graham’s work is much more challenging to look at and therefore more
rewarding. Graham’s work illuminates the links among comics, graffiti, signs,
and labels; it’s not just about glossy images.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Hate-004.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3217" alt="Hate 004"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Hate-004.png"
width="1024" height="768" /></a>

	The “smiley face” in <em>Watchmen,</em> does something similar, reminding
us that Moore and Gibbons’ work is engaged with multiple visual signification
systems. (<em>Mind the Gap</em> invokes the London Underground with its title
and occasional use of the station symbol, but not significantly so; in fact
it’s confusing because the story is set in New York.)

	For me it’s a fine line between art that is “clean” and art that is over
the top. For instance I’m a big admirer of Jamie McKelvie’s work in
<em>Phonogram</em>, where the art is hardly sketchy, but the absence of
colour keeps it “comicky.” In Young Avengers Volume 2 that McKelvie also
worked on with <em>Phonogram</em> writer Kieron Gillen, the addition of
colour brings the visual experience close to that of <em>Mind the Gap</em>.
But a playfulness with form that matches the playfulness of the writing saves
it from tipping over into the over-saturated category. In such cases, the art
redeems itself by moving beyond the aim of “looking good” towards meaning
making.

	<a

class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3220" alt="Hate 002"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Hate-002.png"
width="768" height="1024" /></a>

	David Aja and Javier Pulido's work with Matt Fraction in <em>Hawkeye</em>
self-consciously reclaims a certain style of “primitive” comics art in an age
of computer generated glossiness, though for all I know, Aja and Pulido’s
work might be heavily dependent on computers! Elsewhere in <em>Graphixia</em>
David has celebrated Aja and Pulido’s work, but what appeals to me is its
“flat” style: it has a lot in common with the new iOS 7 design. This style is
less dependent on the photographic image (with it’s excess of information)
and more on the iconic image that strips away superfluous information so we
can get at what’s important.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Hate-003.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3222" alt="Hate 003"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Hate-003.png"
width="768" height="1024" /></a>The emphasis on the iconic also makes the
page structure of the comic more significant. In <em>Mind the Gap</em> page
structure seems arbitrary, just a way of putting these glossy pictures
together. In <em>Hawkeye</em> page structure and image work together in a
meaningful way. Flat style draws attention to page structure while
photographic structure distracts from it. Come to think of it, McKelvie and
Gillen’s work emphasizes page structure as well.

	When I read <em>Mind the Gap</em> on ComiXology, I don’t feel the need to
look at the whole page. But when I read <em>Hawkeye</em>, I spend a little
time surveying the page as a whole before moving to panel view, because I
know the time is well-spent.

	So…that’s what I hate. I hope someone comes along with a corrective to my
view of the art in <em>Mind the Gap</em>. In the end, I’d rather hear someone
else talk about why they like it, than me talk about why I hate it.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I haven't read Mind the Gap, so I don't have
anything to say about that particularly, but there is something about the
computerized over-coloring in comics that bothers me. "Too muchness" is a
good term for it. There's something of a sameness in it as well, at least for
me, in that the coloring technique sometimes overpowers the artist's
individuality, which makes many books look the same at a glance. A while back
I saw some pages of Red Tide that Steranko had recolored, and I couldn't see
that the changes had helped. It seems like the limitations of 70s printing
technology made for more powerful images, at least in that case. I wouldn't
say that I hate over-coloring, but it is a disappointing
trend.]]></wp:comment_content> <wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Despite how others
might perceive my personality, I don’t hate much; I am however constantly
irritated by so many things. One of the things that gets to me is repetition,
especially when it comes in response to an opportunity for significant
change.

	A few qualifiers right off the bat: 1) this is not going to be a rant
about what I hate about a particular comic, but I will point to a particular
comic in order to make my case. The case applies to everything. 2) This isn’t
a rant, but a legitimate concern about how we define the legitimacy and
evolution of comics–however we define it. I’m not making a claim about how
we’ll define comics, if we’ll define comics, or that we need to define
comics.

	It begins and ends with Superman, because comics, to some extent, began
and will end with Superman. That character is always part of the
conversation. No matter how hard we try to get him out of the conversation,
there he is hiding in the phone booth, trying to change, only to emerge in
the same blueish suit, with some yellow accents, a cape–usually red–and that
massive “S” on his chest. And this is the point.

	Take DC comics–its moniker a lame rethinking of “<em>Detective
Comics</em>”–and their “<em>New 52</em>,” often referred to as a “reboot.”
Y’know “reboot” your computer? When it’s frozen and won’t work anymore, so
you start it up again in the hopes that it will return to normal again. You
sit there and you pray that everything will return to normal and not be all
screwed up and not working. You put absolute faith in that reboot getting you
back to exactly where you were when things were okay. You don’t do it so that
everything will change–that’s your worst nightmare. And herein lies the
problem with comics: they don’t change, they just say they’re changing.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/The_New_52_supes.jpg
"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3235" alt="The_New_52_supes"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/The_New_52_supes.jpg"
width="300" height="464" /></a>

	With the <em>New 52</em>, DC had a real opportunity to revisit some of
its characters (I don’t need them to do it to all of them) and make some real
changes, but no. Even the inaugural cover harkens back to the original
Superman <em>Action Comics #1</em> as if to further entrench the “we’re
saying we’re changing! But don’t worry, we’re not changing just re-drawing!
See, you know Action Comics #1 right? This is the same only more close!” The
loss of the panicked guy in the lower left-hand corner of <em>Action Comics
#1</em> in the <em>New 52</em> meant that I couldn’t point to an apt symbol
for my own sarcastic reaction to the reboot. Suffice to say, that’s me
reacting to the idea that the <em>New 52</em> means anything but the same old
same old. Of course, most of the objection to the <em>New 52</em> is that it
does away with the numbers that connect the comics to the past: "don't
change!"

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/action-comics-first-
issue-1938.jpg"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/action-comics-first-
issue-1938-193x300.jpg" alt="action-comics-first-issue-1938" width="193"
height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3233" /></a>

	Even the heroes themselves don’t change. Look at Supes and Batman and
Wonder Woman:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new-52-allheroes.jpg
"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3234" alt="new-52-allheroes"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new-52-allheroes.jpg"
width="570" height="300" /></a>

	Pretty much the same as always. White, tall, handsome, muscled. How about
we take a look at the physics of living on a planet with huge gravity like
Krypton had, what effect would that have on the body. How big does Superman’s
chest have to be to accommodate a heart that can pump blood around a body
under that much gravitational pressure? Yeah, we’re gonna make him the same.
What would so much time in the water do too Aquaman’s hair? Would he have
hair? How would that work? Naw, a bald Aquaman will confuse our readers about
the intentions of the New 52. Wonder Woman: how does an Amazon woman really
look; how might a really fine muscled woman look? Ummmm, no. She has to be
sexy too.

	All this to say, that we like at times to sit around and laud comics for
being nostalgia, unchanging. I’ve even written about how comics actually do
really cool things within the constraints of repeated origin stories. Umberto
Eco wrote a really famous essay about how Superman stays the same and what
that means. In some ways, what’s great about comics is that they don’t
change. Peter Parker is still Peter Parker.

	That said, let’s stop talking about how Peter Parker was a really
innovative turn in character for comics. That was 1962. What’s changed? And
don’t say Venom–that’s just a colourist without colours. Some will gleefully
point to “The Graphic Novel” and “Slice of Life” comics. Or trot out the old
standards: <em>The Dark Knight</em>, <em>Watchmen</em>, and <em>Sin
City</em>; fantastic innovations all, but more refiguring of the same. The
bottom line is that the basic format of comics–even with its move to
digital–has not changed significantly since the beginning. Chris Ware, one of
the labelled “innovators” is commended for releasing a box full of references
to comics’ past and Art Spiegelman’s <em>Maus</em>, for all its triumphs,
still uses strict panel formats and alludes to the cat and mouse trope that
often defines the medium. After all our innovations, shifts, reboots, we’re
still dealing with “books,” “frames,” “gutters,” and I think, like the
rebooted computer screen, we’re happy to see things that way again.

	Perhaps being unchanging is part of becoming an established media. That
said, it also means nothing’s happening, nothing’s moving, nothing’s doing.
As we continue to debate comics’ legitimacy and assert its position as an
evolutionary medium that can respond to the cultural currents of our time, we
need to acknowledge its stasis. At some point, if comics is to be taken
seriously as a form of cultural representation or commentary, we’re going to
have to acknowledge that we need to move forward and really change things up
in a significant way, either in response to a mediated shift–ibooks!–or
because something else will come along–who plays video games anyway?–and
steals our resonance. Ctrl-Alt-Delete / Ctrl-Alt-Delete / Ctrl-Alt-Delete
(I’m using a Mac).]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I wasn't at the meeting
where we decided we were all going to write about things we hate this cycle.
 In fact, the only thing I really hate is spending a lot of time and energy
talking about things I don't like.  As I have discussed in other forums, <a
href="http://bookriot.com/2012/07/20/ode-to-enthusiasm/">I am mostly in this
for the enthusiasm</a>.  I am far more this

	<img class="alignnone" alt=""
src="http://purgeatl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/comicbookguy.jpg"
width="412" height="232" />.

	But bowing to peer pressure, I've been spending a lot of time this week
thinking about what I hate, and I've come to the conclusion that the thing I
hate most in the world of comics scholarship is the obsessive hand-wringing
about whether or not comics are worthy of scholarship.  As <a
href="https://twitter.com/hattiek/status/394161389196963840">my  fellow
Graphixian Hattie noted the other day on the Twitters</a>, "Neuroticism is an
unattractive quality in a person, let alone a discipline."  Look around
Twitter, blogs, conferences, department meetings, faculty colloquia -- in all
these spaces you will find extended discussion of comics and their worth or
lack of worth as an object of academic study.

	We spend a lot of time being anxious about <a
href="http://thecmetler.blogspot.ca/2013/02/why-are-comics-still-in-search-of
.html">whether comics studies is seen as legitimate</a>, <a
href="http://www.umassmedia.com/art_lifestyle/comics-in-school-why-study-
comics/article_1708ac9c-1e26-11e3-b520-001a4bcf6878.html">whether comics are
seen as valuable in our classrooms</a>, <a
href="http://firstsecondbooks.typepad.com/mainblog/2009/10/why-we-should-be-
teaching-comics.html">whether people understand why we teach with
comics</a>, <a
href="http://sequart.org/magazine/6519/why-i-believe-in-comics/">whether
people respect comics</a>, <a
href="http://sequart.org/magazine/4079/why-comics-have-failed-to-achieve-real
-respect/">whether people respect comics for the right reasons</a>, <a
href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cinema_journal/summary/v050/50.3.ndalianis
.html">whether people understand comics studies</a>... sometimes we're so
freaking introspective that it's amazing we find time to actually engage with
comics themselves.

	We're trying to justify our own existence.  And we need to stop.

	The reality is that we study comics for the same reasons we study
anything else: because it's there, because it seems to us to be doing
something interesting, and because we have something to say.  And that's
enough.

	There are generally two audiences for these conversations about the role
of comics within academic discourse: those who agree with you (see: most
Twitter discussion) and those who don't (see: many department meetings).  I'm
not sure either one of these conversations is productive.  In the first, we
make ourselves feel a lot better but don't engage with those outside our
world -- which while more interdisciplinary than many fields, is small.  We
come up with more and more illustrious reasons for why we do what we do and
we feel good about our field.  In the second, the audience is probably not
ready to be receptive and not interested in the reasons why we study comics.
 The proof for the non-believer is in producing a body of work and developing
the discipline over time.

	This isn't to say that all of us who engage in these conversations (and
I'm not excluding myself from this <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2013/01/08/notes-towards-a-philosophy-of
-teaching-comics/">as I've been known to justify my existence a time or
twelve</a>) aren't also producing good work -- of course we do -- but I can't
help but think that the energy we spend on rehashing the same conversations
about the state and worth of the discipline would be better spent developing
the discipline itself.  Indeed, I think our willingness to talk at length
about why we exist actually hurts our calls for legitimacy -- if we think we
need to justify comics studies, it will be ever thus.

	You know who never walks into an English department and justifies his or
her existence?  The Chaucerian.  The Renaissance guy.  The Americanist.  The
French New Wave gal doesn't explain herself to a film department.  No one
asks the Social Historian why he's doing what he does.  The worthiness of the
Psychopharmacologist in inborn.  These scholars have a space and they take
it.  I think it's time we take our space, and the first step is not engaging
in debates of worthiness.  We're worthy because we exist and have something
interesting to say.  Now it's time to say it: let's talk about the
work.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I’d like to preface
this post with the statement that the attributes that I love about comics are
legion: their inspiring artistry that frequently carries a subtextual
message, their ability make the fantastic appear plausible, their captivating
way of immediately allowing us to suspend reality in pursuit of higher
meanings, their revisioning of typical literature that draws others in to
create new readerships who would otherwise never engage with novels. That
said, there are aspects of their production that I find detestable and
detrimental to the industry as a whole. My main gripe, which I voice to
anyone who has the patience to listen to me on the subject, is the modern
variant cover. What follows is a very nerdy history of variants in mainstream
comic books – <i>mea culpa</i> for the very obvious fetishization.

	Variants have a long tradition in comics, and they were all at one point
long sought after commodities and part of the reason that comics as physical
collectibles were so desirable. The earliest in my recollection which are
agreed<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1537682.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3251" alt="1537682"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1537682-300x297.jpg"
width="300" height="297" /></a> upon variants to collectors are the GRR
(Golden Record Reprint) versions of Fantastic Four #1, Amazing Spider-Man #1,
Journey Into Mystery #86 (the first appearance of Thor) and Avengers #1 that
appeared in the 1960s. These were identical copies of their source material
released shortly after the original issues, identifiable only because they
were missing the price on the cover and because they were packaged with a
vinyl recording of the dialogue (with sound effects!) of the issue – one
could say these were the precursor to the multimedia comics that we see
today. Fascinating pieces of comics’ history all, and while not worth the
same dollar figure as the originals, still highly longed for in the comic
collecting community, particularly when still sealed.

width="225" height="300" /></a>Other examples of variants that followed in
the early 1970s are of dubious value and intrigue, mostly having to do with
misprints and double covers (some of which I own), though both DC and Marvel
started producing alternate versions of comic covers in the later 70s that
they could not have known would be sought after during this period decades
later: for a short period, Whitman acquired the rights to distribute a number
of DC titles, prompting them to change the DC logo on the cover to a Whitman
logo for the purpose of advertising the fact (many of which I own). While not
covering DC’s entire canon, Whitman distributed its flagship titles which
included at the time Action Comics, Superman, Batman, Green Lantern and DC
Comics Presents among others. Marvel had its own variants during the same
period, though these are less interesting; commonly called “price variants,”
these were alternate versions that were test cases to see if the comic buying
audience would still <a

fake_star_wars_1_price_variant_close-up-300x208.png" width="300" height="208"
/></a>purchase titles if the price was increased by a nickel. The result is a
very limited print run of several titles released in select cities that bore
a price of 35 cents instead of 30 – some titles that are already highly
collectible have price variants, including Star Wars #1 and three issues of
the very early stages of the Chris Claremont X-Men run (#s 98, 99 and 100),
and when professionally graded these comics can be worth up to fifteen times
the value of the regular issues.

	We don’t see variants of any kind in comics in the early to mid 80’s with
two notable exceptions: DC’s Justice League #3 and Firestorm #61 (neither of
which I own, sadly). These were again very limited release, as they were test
cases for DC’s <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/superman_comics1987.
jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3252 alignleft" alt="superman_comics1987"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/superman_comics1987.
jpg" width="197" height="185" /></a>potential new logo, when they were seeing
if the market would take to entirely rebranding DC Comics as Superman Comics.
Needless to say, the test did not go well, and DC kept its moniker to this
day. Again, the scarcity of these issues, even though they occur in
storylines in which nothing of note happens, makes them very interesting
curiosities in collecting. One other variant worth mentioning is Batman #428,
“A Death in the Family” part three, which had a different newsstand cover
than the cover released to the newly arising collector comic book stores. The
sidebar on the cover read “Robin finds his Mother. And waiting is the Joker,
planning a revenge that is swift, violent, terrible. Can Robin survive?” The
<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Batman_427.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3253" alt="Batman_427"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Batman_427-194x300.
jpg" width="194" height="300" /></a>newsstand version has a UPC code directly
underneath, but the direct market version bears the line “you will decide –
details on back cover.” Collectors were given the opportunity to phone in
their vote as to whether or not Robin would be killed off in the issue,
making the cover a first acknowledgement that comics were starting to respond
to the new marketplace. Two versions of Batman #428 were produced for the
following month, and the one that went to press saw the death of Robin based
on the popular vote. This was the last real variant of the decade, and it’s
significant as the ploy garnered much media attention, catching the eye of
those who saw comics far more as commodities than as inherently valuable for
the quality of their narratives.

	Enter the 90s, the decade which nearly ended production of mainstream
comic books on the whole. Once the collector market became firmly established
and communities and conventions began to occur all across North America based
on collecting scarce issues, both DC and Marvel attempted to capitalize on
the dynamics of this changing fan base with a glut of variant covers for
comics that they knew would be strong sellers regardless. Early standouts
here were Jim Lee’s X-Men #1, with five different covers (including a
gatefold) and Todd McFarlane’s<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/x-men1.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3254" alt="x-men1"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/x-men1-300x119.jpg"
width="300" height="119" /></a> Spider-Man #1 with several versions variously
polybagged and employing gold and silver ink. DC followed suit, and during
the first half of the decade nearly every comic where any major event
occurred, the publishers would release two or three covers of each issue,
with special features ranging from embossing, holograms, plastic jewels glued
on the covers, polybagging and die-cutting. With comics still being
relatively inexpensive, collectors bought these in the hundreds, sometimes
thousands, hoping for particular issues to increase in value. For a short
time they did, and I personally remember buying multiple copies of the
“death” of Superman in issue #75 (polybagged with a button, poster and black
armband) which I sold shortly after for a 2,500% markup – and at those
prices, who could blame some collectors for treating comics like stocks? Many
did, after all, outperform anything that the NYSE was offering at the time,
and I have to admit that I'm guilty of contributing to the variant craze at
the time.

	Of course, this overproduction couldn’t last, and with mass print runs
unlike anything comics had seen before in its history, the scarcity of comics
was at an end – the new breed of “collector” was often sitting on thousands
of copies of particular issues hoping for their value to increase, never
engaging with the stories at all. The companies became bloated and reliant on
the extra income, and when variants ceased to be desirable due to
overproduction, the market collapsed in on itself nearly forcing Marvel into
bankruptcy. The industry learned its lesson, for a time, and variants became
a taboo amongst the comic collecting community, as those of us who remained
collectors because of the stories, art and concepts in comics begrudged the
fact that we had nearly lost the medium due to corporate greed and a
commoditization of the industry that had reached levels of absurdity. To this
day, if you were to bring in a collection to a comic store with the intent to
sell and you mentioned that they were produced in the 90’s, every store owner
would turn you away due both to their overproduction in the period and an
underlying contempt for the industry during the period.

	The late 90’s / very early 2000’s saw a return to storytelling, with
variants being practically non-existent – both of the Big Two remembered how
close they had come to ending comics entirely, and print runs became far more
modest. By the mid 2000’s, however, marketers began to find a way to exploit
the collector’s market once again, this time with more caution, leading into
the variant concern <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Batman608RRPCover.
jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3255" alt="Batman608RRPCover"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Batman608RRPCover-
194x300.jpg" width="194" height="300" /></a>that I have with comics produced
today. Though the odd alternate cover was produced with certain key issues,
the first major collectible variant came from DC, with its Batman #608. A
“Retailer Round table Program” (RRP) alternate cover was released only to key
comic book store owners with whom DC met to discuss marketing strategies –
the cover, a gorgeous piece drawn by Jim Lee, became immediately collectible
due both to the quality of the art and the extreme scarcity of the issue (a
print run of about 500 copies). When the collector’s market responded by
driving the price of the issue up to, at times, over $1,000, both DC and
Marvel began to experiment with a larger variety of “retailer incentive”
variant covers. While starting slowly with only key issues being attempted,
retailers would receive variants based on the number of regular covers
ordered. Early attempts saw these being distributed at the ratio of 1:10 and
1:25, making them again commodities for both those outside and inside the
collector community – Marvel’s Civil War, which we’ve discussed a few time on
Graphixia, was notable culprit here, with 1:10 variants and 1:25 sketch
variants being released for each issue. Of course, this had a negative impact
on the rest of the issues, as retailers knew they would be able to sell their
variants at a higher price to collectors and would therefore order what they
knew would ultimately become overstock in order to hit targets that would get
them more copies of the alternate covers.

	And now, today: Comics have once again come dangerously close to
repeating the same mistake that nearly destroyed the industry in the 90’s.
Retailer incentive variants are released with nearly every issue of flagship
series from both publishers, and the order targets have gotten much higher –
it is not unusual to see variants released at a ratio of 1:100 and even
1:200. DC very <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/3d.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-full wp-image-3262" alt="3d"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/3d.jpg" width="195"
height="300" /></a>recently released fifty-two 3D lenticular covers for all
of its series (which are actually all stunning due to the new technologies
employed in their creation, the effects of which are unfortunately impossible
to reproduce here), and they produce versions of several of their most
popular titles with alternate covers that are polybagged with a codes for
digital downloads of the issue. While this is frustrating for both a
collector and reader of comics who wants the industry to survive another
decade, the trend towards a complete revisitation of the 90’s is keenly
apparent this month in particular. What prompted this post was actually not a
release from either DC or Marvel, but from Image Comics which publishes the
Walking Dead. Issue #100 of the series was recently released, with eight
variant covers by some of comics most popular artists (all available at 1:1)
and a chromium cover (plasticized with silver ink), with an accompanying
1:200 retailer incentive. This month, on the series’ ten year anniversary,
Image has released Walking Dead #115 with no less than fifteen variants: ten
interlockin<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Walking-Dead-10-
Years.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3256"
alt="Walking-Dead-10-Years"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Walking-Dead-10-Years
-300x184.jpg" width="300" height="184" /></a>g covers that create a single
poster-sized image, a blank cover, an NYCC cover and two other incentives.
The total print run for the issue is over 350,000. This is not to say that
the other players are not equally to blame in attempting to force
overproduction again – a few months ago, DC released Justice League of
America #1, with over 250,000 copies in print due to 52 different covers, one
for each state flag (plus Puerto Rico and the American flag).

	While I definitely enjoy the original concept of variants in comic books,
as a collector I prize them for the stories that surround their production as
well as their scarcity. The early variants in comics’ history prompt an
exploration of comics as a medium and reveal interesting characteristics of
both their production and experimentation with form, creating a narrative of
comics as physical objects that can exist parallel to the stories contained
within them. What is currently happening in the industry highlights that
comics’ fanbase is being exploited by publishers that are attempting a final
hurrah in terms of sales under the looming threat (though it’s been looming
for quite some time) of the death of print publication. When comics become
treated solely as material goods by collectors and investors alike, an
inevitable crash follows that has a twofold effect: firstly, it jeopardizes
the viability of the companies that create them, and secondly it makes comics
appear – particularly to the outside observer – to be the products of a
juvenile industry bent solely on capital gains and not the production of art.
I certainly love the materiality of comics, though not if it comes at the
cost of their reputation and perhaps even the industry as a
whole.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the many great
things about taking part in an academic conference and presenting a paper is
the feedback and comments one receives from one’s peers. Last month I
presented a paper at the <a
href="http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/ibds/?page_id=372"
target="_blank">International Graphic Novel &amp; International Bande
Dessinée Society Conference</a> in Glasgow (my second favourite conference
that month). My paper, <em>The Parsimonius Cartoonist: Scottish Identity and
the Autobiographical Comics of Eddie Campbell</em> looked at Campbell’s
relationship with money through the prism of that most notorious of Scottish
stereotypes, excessive frugality or tightfistedness.

	<a

217x300.jpg" alt="" width="217" height="300" /></a>During a discussion
afterwards another comics scholar wondered why I hadn’t discussed the Disney
character Scrooge McDuck. Well, for the simple reason that I had never read
any of the comics, “what not even Carl Barks?” they asked incredulously. No,
not even, and I had only a vague recollection of the animated cartoons from
my childhood. Helpfully Graphixia’s anthropomorphic season has allowed me to
address this apparent oversight. By happenstance the second release in the
Fantagraphics<em> Complete Carl Barks Disney Library</em> has only recently
been published and it is all about the aforementioned Mr McDuck -<a
href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/walt-disney-s-uncle-scrooge-
only-a-poor-old-man-june-2012-u.s.-canada-only-6.html" target="_blank"><em>
Walt Disney's Uncle Scrooge: Only a Poor Old Man</em></a>.

	Scrooge McDuck, created by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Barks" target="_blank">Carl Barks</a>
in 1947, is the uncle of Donald Duck on his mother’s side. Although named
after Charles Dickens’ famous miser Ebeneezer Scrooge from <em>A Christmas
Carol</em>, Uncle Scrooge was made to sound even stingier by being Scottish!
Many sources (ie the internet) claim that McDuck was based on industrialist
Andrew Carnegie, although I couldn’t find any evidence to back this up and it
was never confirmed by Barks.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wdus01.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3030" title="wdus01"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wdus01-300x216.jpg"
alt="" width="300" height="216" /></a>The first story in the volume is
<em>Only A Poor Old Man</em>, which was first published in March 1952, and
straight away we are presented with one of Scrooge’s signature moves,
swimming like a porpoise in his vast Money Bin. Scrooge is the richest person
in the Disney universe and his fortune is described in many ways. At the
start of this story it is ‘umpteen-centrifugilillion dollars’ but throughout
the book it is most commonly described as filling an area of ‘three cubic
acres’.

	Scrooge’s Scottish heritage is detailed in <em>The Horse-Radish
Treasure</em> from September 1953. In a flashback set in 1753 we see
Scrooge’s ancestor Captain Seafoam McDuck swindled in a deal to carry a chest
of horse-radish from Glasgow to Jamaica on his ship the Golden Goose. In real
life many shipping merchants made their fortunes sailing between Glasgow and
America in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. The Merchant City area of Glasgow
still betrays the fortunes of these nouveau riche traders with its grand
architecture. The neo-classical palace that today houses the Gallery of
Modern Art was originally the home of ‘<a
href="http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/History%201700-1830"
target="_blank">Tobacco Laird</a>’ William Cunninghame. The gallery’s vast
ground floor was once his ballroom.

	The tobacco trade was part of the trading route trading between Britain
and North America and the Caribbean, it later became a leg of the ‘triangular
trade’ when it connected with the slave trade from West Africa. In <a
href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Painting-The-Forth-Bridge-Scottish/dp/
1854106406" target="_blank"><em>Painting the Forth Bridge: A Search for
Scottish Identity</em></a>, Carl MacDougall claims that Glasgow’s love affair
with America dates back to these Tobacco Lords in the 1700s. A modern version
of this trans-Atlantic connection can be seen in the many artists in <a
href="http://classic.tcj.com/international/studio-profile-hope-street-studios
/" target="_blank">Hope Street studios</a> in Glasgow who are producing
superhero comics for Marvel and DC.

	Reading these comics for the first time I can appreciate the joy people
find in them. Scrooge is a self-made umpteen-centrifugilillionairre who is
always figuring out ways not to spend his money. The one-page gag strips are
some of my favourites as they cut straight to the heart of his character. On
finding out that a taxi starts the meter as soon as he enters the cab,
Scrooge pauses at the door, only climbing inside when the stop light changes
to green. In another short strip a beggar keeps asking for a dime for coffee
and eventually Scrooge relents but only because he can buy one for himself
and the second cup is free.

	This shows that he is not completely heartless and in the longer strip
<em>Back to the Klondike</em> we are introduced to Glittering Goldie, a woman
from Scrooge’s prospecting past and possible previous love interest. They
feud again and Scrooge decides to stage a competition with her to see who can
find his buried treasure of gold nuggets. When Goldie wins Scrooge blames his
failure on forgetting to take his memory medication, however Donald realises
that he didn’t forget but allowed Goldie to win. Although he would never
admit to it, Scrooge wanted to see this woman from his past escape her life
of destitution.

	<a

class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3042" title="Scrooge 1"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Scrooge-1-300x225.jpg
" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Like other Disney staff Barks worked
anonymously until his identity was uncovered in the late 1950s, until then
fans knew him only as the Good Duck Artist and it’s easy to see why. His
anthropomorphic creatures are full of life and character, be they ducks, dogs
or pigs. I think my favourites are Scrooge’s nemeses the Beagle Boys who are
all completely identical and are only differentiated by the prison numbers on
their chests (see them on the book cover above). Some of the more fantastical
creatures are the denizens of the undersea world in <em>The Secret of
Atlantis</em>. The scaly green gilled human-fish are reminiscent of <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046876/" target="_blank"><em>The Creature
from the Black Lagoon</em></a>, which came out in cinemas the same year
(1954). I’d also wager that Mike Mignola had read that strip before coming up
with the character <a href="http://hellboy.wikia.com/wiki/Abraham_Sapien"
target="_blank">Abe Sapien</a> in <em>Hellboy</em>. <p style="text-align:
left;">The backgrounds are often wonderfully detailed, Atlantis, and the
whales that swim around it, are much more ‘realistically’ rendered than
Scrooge and Donald. Similarly the Shangri-la-esque village of Tralla La in
the strip of the same name is in a very detailed Himalayan mountain valley.
However, the yellow slant eyed ducks that live in Tralla La are a little
troublesome but perhaps just a product of the unenlightened politics of the
time. Strangely in this world of anthropomorphic ducks, dogs and pigs, the
creature that Scrooge ask for directions to the village appears to be
human.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><a

had initially intended to write about Norwegian cartoonist Jason and while I
enjoyed my brief foray into the world of Disney as drawn by Carl Barks, it is

graphic novel, <a
href="http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog/a-matter-of-life/839"
target="_blank">A Matter Of Life</a>, is a first for him. After working in
simple, straight-to-pen black and white for many years, Brown has recently
begun working in colour, with the Transformers-esque <a

of Darth Vader as a father to little Luke and Leia, <a

autobiographical work in colour, and it is Brown’s autobiographical work that
made his name in comics, so it’s a welcome addition to his oeuvre.

	<em>A Matter Of Life</em> explores Brown’s relationship with his young
son, Oscar, as well as his relationship with his own father. This
relationship leads Brown to explore the significance of religion in his life,
as his father was a minister at their local church. Previous books such as
Little Things and Funny Misshapen Body hinted at tensions with his father and
religious childhood but always skirted around them, most likely for fear of
misrepresenting his family. The focus of Brown’s autobiographical work was
also on his romantic relationships previously, candidly depicting the graphic
sexual and emotional failures therein. His 2010 “B-sides” collection, <a
href="http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog/undeleted-scenes/712"
target="_blank">Undeleted Scenes</a>, did feature two shorter stories about
his son’s birth and subsequent hospital visits, but they were in black and
white and did not explore the emotional depth of the father-son bond. But
they felt like a progression: a growing maturity and graceful ageing of
Brown’s comics. With <em>A Matter Of Life</em> this progression has reached a
peak just as Brown is at the peak of his career, with a recent Eisner award
win under his belt. He has also earned the significant literary accolade of
being a New York Times Bestselling author, even if it is for his <em>Star
Wars</em>-related books and not his autobiographical ones.

	The book is episodic, bound together with a thematic rather than a
distinct linear narrative thread, but does not suffer for it. Brown
alternates between vignettes from his own childhood and Oscar’s, with the
young Jeffrey being involved in the church, believing in God and dealing with
guilt and the questioning his belief. Oscar, meanwhile, is not brought up
with religion being something he must follow without question – instead, we
see him asking his dad some difficult questions and discovering adult things,
such as his own mortality, which doesn’t seem to concern him too much, as he
tells his dad excitedly that he can “FIGHT dying!” There is a significant
contrast between young Jeff and young Oscar: Jeff grows up with shame, worry
and confusion, while Oscar always appears innocent, bright and optimistic: an
almost perfect child. The implication is that Jeff is a better parent for
bringing up his own son without the worries that were forced upon him and
being more open with Oscar about religion being his own decision; however,
this is never made explicit and is complicated and refuted significantly by
many of the stories which depict Jeff and his own dad together. We see them
enjoying pizza, taking a trip to New York together, and playing trains with
Oscar, free entirely from any of the resentment which Jeff could easily have
harboured due to the religious upbringing he rejected as an adult.

class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3061" /></a>

	The book could have been a bitter and bleak graphic novel, but is instead
full of warmth and humour, aided by the bright colour scheme. It is framed at
the beginning and end by splash pages which appear to have been painted
rather than drawn, and which depict stars and space in a much more abstract,
expressionistic style than Brown’s drawings. This framing reminds us that the
short stories in <em>A Matter Of Life</em> are just small moments in the
context both of Brown’s entire life and the vastness of the universe, but
that therein lies life itself – also an underlying theme in Brown’s <a
href="http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog/little-things/626"
target="_blank">Little Things</a>. His choice moments of family life paint a
picture of complex, but powerful love, and of a strong, sweet bond between
two generations of fathers and sons.

	The striking refinement and emotional intelligence of <em>A Matter Of
Life</em>, and Brown’s gradual development and new found maturity in this
book, is an apt metaphor for the development of comics as an art form. The
form has been sullied by accusations of a lack of narrative ambition and
childish, underdeveloped storytelling (part of the arguments of Frederic
Wertham and others which led to the founding of the Comics Code Authority),
and these accusations could well be made of Brown’s work. Although the raw,
underdeveloped art style and painful honesty first engaged me with Jeffrey
Brown’s work, I still have trouble refuting these accusations when  they’re
levelled at Brown’s early graphic novels.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Photo-05-08-2013-17-
33-33.png"><img

class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3062" /></a>

	Brown himself is aware of these criticisms, of course, and has made of
light of them throughout his career. The first page of his collection of
one-shots and strip cartoons, <a
href="http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog/i-am-going-to-be-small/527"
target="_blank">I Am Going To Be Small</a>, is a collection of dubious but
true “praise,” rewritten in Brown’s round, childish letters. According to
writer Warren Ellis, Brown’s works (which, at this point in his career, can
refer only to his relationship comics Clumsy and Unlikely) are “emotionally
about six years old,” while the Portland Mercury calls them “Pathetic losers’
nerd-porn as illustrated by a five-year-old.” And cutting though they are,
these words are easily backed up by a selection of almost any panels from
Brown’s first two books, which variously depict him crying on the phone to
his girlfriend, comforting his crying girlfriend as she expresses the belief
that she ruined his loss of virginity for him and having awkward,
uncomfortable sex.

	The same criticisms, however, could not be made of <em>A Matter Of
Life</em>. The art, whilst still simple, with varied lines and a cuteness
similar to that of his Top Shelf contemporaries James Kochalka, Craig
Thompson and Paul Hornschemeir, is refined, engaging and expertly rendered,
with straightforward colours and shading that sit well within Brown’s lines.
His Raymond Carver-esque microcosmic stories are literate, engaging
narratives which subtly expose emotion, depth and complexity. With this book,
Jeffrey Brown has truly come of age, whilst still retaining the simplicity,
humour and warmth of his earlier work.

Dumb</title> <link>http://www.graphixia.ca/2013/08/jason-turner-2/</link>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I wanted to order a
copy of Simon Moreton’s <em>Grand Gestures</em> for someone who had helped us
out tremendously with our Graphixia <em>Comics and the Multimodal World</em>
conference and was keen on Simon’s work. <em>Grand Gestures</em> is published
by <em>Retrofit,</em> Box Brown’s publishing outfit in Philadelphia. Because
sending all that way for a single comic book seemed foolish, I also ordered
Andrew White’s <em>We Will Remain</em> (his work has impressed me on the
<em>Comics Workbook</em> Tumblr), and I took a flyer on Jason Turner’s
<em>Farm School</em> because it looked interesting.

	When I learned that Turner is a Vancouver comics artist, the thought of
sending to Philadelphia to aquire the work of a local artist struck me as
funny. As I started digging and discovered that <em>True Loves</em> the comic
that Turner works on with his wife Manien Bothma was nominated for the “One
Book, One Vancouver” prize in 2007 and is recognized as a comic that is
quintessentially associated with Vancouver, I felt that if I knew anything
about comics I would already know Turner’s work. I had sent away to
Philadelphia to find out something about home and about my own ignorance.

	<em>Farm School</em> is a great example of “show, don’t tell” narrative
comics art. I suppose “post-apocalyptic” is the word everyone writing about
this book will use to describe it. The standard description of the book is a
“pastoral post-apocalyptic walking story” (which reminded me of Oliver East’s
work). But we know know little about the apocalypse that has caused the urban
environment, and the human society within it, to devolve into a ‘pastoral’
state. The traces of the modern world remain tantalizingly, in the bombed out
buildings and abandonned automobiles that the grass and trees encroach on.

	<a

><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3079" title="Farm School 001"

href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Farm-School-001.tiff
"> </a>

	The plot of the comic is essentially the returning of a book to the
library. The main character, Hester, emerges from the woods in contemporary
military dress with a deer that she has shot with a bow and arrow across her
back. Her mission is to go to the centre of the city, to the Crystal Palace,
that operates as an information hub, to get news of a relative. The Crystal
Palace is the only place that has computers, that can retrieve e-mail; it is
a post-apocalyptic telegraph office. Along the way, Hester drops off the deer
with her friend Mabel, who says she wishes Hester would return to the town
permanently from the woods and asks her to return a library book. When Hester
visits the bakery along her way, the baker also makes a request, asking her
to escort his daughter, Patricia, to town so she can deliver baguettes.
Presumably such a task involves some danger. This notion of a journey in
which the character picks up things and people along the way makes a sly nod
to the video-game tradition as well as the picaresque/romance/epic tradition.
But because <em>Farm School</em> is presented as a slice of life, everything
is low key. The epic battles are in the past, though danger always lurks in
the margins and ominous backgrounds.

	<em>Farm School</em>’s success as a comic depends on the interplay
between foreground and background in both images and narrative. The
backgrounds in the panels serve as evidence of a violent battle, as does
Hester’s military outfit. Meanwhile, in the foreground we see a buccolic,
perhaps even nostalgic, story of people carrying out simple functions of
human exchange. The farm school of the title is a place where people learn to
grow vegetables that they trade for things like bread.

	Turner’s philosophical focus in the comic is the overlay of exchange
networks: the way that the revived ‘old-fashioned’ network of exchanging
goods relates to our contemporary technological network of exchanging
information. The notion of traffic and intersection appears in the
totemization of a set of traffic lights slung over a tree. Hester makes sure
to leave tributes: Red for blood, gold for the sun and green for plants. This
moment both crystallizes Turner’s post- and pre-modern interplay and suggests
the arbitrariness of iconic signs.

	<a

><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3081" title="Farm School 002"

956x1024.jpg" alt="" width="956" height="1024" /></a>

	The action climax of the narrative occurs when Hester fails to stop
Patricia from escaping town for the dangerous outlying area with a bunch of
her friends. She cannot overcome Patricia’s youthful free will. But the real
substance of the story lies in Hester’s refusal to live in the town–she
resides instead in the nearby woods–or sleep in a building. Obviously, Hester
has some sort of post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result of some battle,
perhaps a battle that led to the world looking the way that it does. Hester’s
anxiety about the world that surrounds her as she moves through her mundane
activities of the day has the feel of an autobiographical comic. So it’s not
surprising to learn that Jason Turner is well into autobiographical comics,
my favourite being <a

	My response to <em>Farm School</em> was pretty much the diametrical
opposite to <a
title="http://madinkbeard.com/archives/every-comic-i-read-in-2013-february"
href="http://madinkbeard.com/archives/every-comic-i-read-in-2013-february"
target="_blank">Derik Badman</a>’s. That is, he dislikes it and I like it for
the same reasons. Here is what Badman says: <blockquote>Mostly I was just
bored. I’m not really sure what the point of the comic was. It wasn’t all
about the world building (the way Finder is at times), at least not enough to
be interesting on its own. It wasn’t really about the characters. It didn’t
have much of a plot. It wasn’t poetic or just aesthetically beautiful. It was
more like a part of something bigger that got hacked down to short comic
size. A lot of narrative comics seem to have that trouble, like people don’t
want to spend the time/effort to really do the narrative, or they can’t quite
edit out in a way to make it work, but they still want to tell a
story.</blockquote> What Badman sees as “hacked down,” I see as synecdochic,
as <em>Farm School</em> applies the narrative strategies of the slice of life
comic to the sci-fi apocalyptic comic, to create a neat hybrid. The point
here is not that Turner is “lazy” but that he is putting the viewer to work,
engaging him or her in the act of imagining what the artist leaves out. It’s
pretty clear early on that Turner is presenting a synecdoche of something,
and even if we cannot derive the whole clearly from this part, I for one was
pretty interested in trying. I guess the point of contention between Badman
and I on this comic is who should be doing what kind of work in the
producer/consumer network. Badman wants Turner to do more of the work that I
feel the viewer should be doing. I don’t necessarily think that either of us
is “correct”; we just have different aesthetic responses.

	Finally, I have to say that the quality of <em>Retrofit</em>’s books is
excellent, well-worth the five or six dollars you will spend on each. The
print quality is beautiful and the books are on lovely paper. My only qualm
is the absence of page numbers.

Haven</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[In only 89 pages,
Daniel Clowes’ <em>Ice Haven</em> (2005) hosts a remarkable cast of
characters with about 14 central protagonists, each in turn given  close
attention. What binds them all together is the backdrop against which their
lives are set, the fictional small town called Ice Haven, and the dramatic
event that set it in turmoil: the kidnapping of David Goldberg. Albeit
functioning as the backbone of the book, this criminal case is quickly
overtaken by the thoughts and everyday lives of the manifold characters.

	Each character is given his own comic strip, a structure Clowes borrows
from the Sunday comics pages: “I started reading old Sunday newspapers to get
inspiration, and I realized what a great thing it would be if the characters
from each comic strip kind of had something to do with each other, even
though they are done in completely different styles” (Clowes qtd. in Guilbert
2009). Clowes uses comic strips as building blocks for the larger narrative
structure of his graphic novel.

	The cover of the 2005 book format advertises <em>Ice Haven</em> as a
‘comic-strip novel’. This paratextual self-definition is something of an
oxymoron. With their short form, comic strips build towards a comic
climax--usually a gag or slapstick--and do not generally share the kind of
development and narrative complexity that is expected from graphic novels,
which rather put a particular emphasis on the storytelling. Moreover, comic
strips have been and still are “an editorially conservative medium, bound by
inflexible formatting constraints” (Hatfield 2005: 4). According to Hatfield,
the formal constraints of the comic strip have impeded it from realizing the
kind of groundbreaking innovations witnessed in book-length alternative
comics (2005: 3).

	Quite paradoxically, Clowes is trying to use the very formal constraints
of the comic strip to address thematic concerns typical of alt comics. In
this regard, Peter Sattler recently remarked that “[Clowes’s] work goes out
of its way to thematize the artist’s and/or the story’s struggle against
comics themselves – against a form that, as Clowes presents it, seems unable
to encompass interior states, unable to escape its own theatricality and
artificiality, unable to circumvent its own closed system of beginnings and
endings, set-ups and punch-lines” (Sattler qtd. in Berlatsky 2013). Sattler
further touches on <em>Wilson</em> (2010) and the rigid structure of the
one-page gag that stands in the way of its thematic ambition.

	In <em>Ice Haven</em>, however, Clowes’ struggle against the limits of
the comic strip serves the thematic concerns of the larger narrative: instead
of being an obstacle to the representation of interior states, they
contribute in depicting loneliness. The format indeed participates in
harboring a feeling of alienation and disconnection so typical of Clowes’s
oeuvre. As Xavier Guilbert notices, “the isolation of the self-centered
characters is reinforced by the comic-strip structure of the story, confining
each individual to his or her own understanding of the world, prisoner of his
or her own space even in the seldom moments when their paths cross” (Guilbert
2006; my translation).

	Clowes draws on a variety of styles and genres to underpin the
individuality of each comic strip, turning the characters into the
(anti)heroes of their own story.  An interesting example is Clowes’ take on
romance comics in the segments casting an egocentric teenager named Violet
Vanderplatz. Here Clowes struggles against the melodramatic tone that
undercuts his representation of Violet’s psychological torments. This
unavoidable sense of "theatricality and artificiality" seems nonetheless to
be issued from Violet herself, who stages her own life as a romance comic and
consequently confronts the clichés of the genre.

	While the comic-strip structure traps the characters into their own
interior world, the larger narrative unity of the ‘novel’ binds them together
around the communal experience of the disappearance of David Goldberg and the
collective relief of his release. All the characters basically share the same
reality, appear on the same stage, but the reader’s access to that reality is
unavoidably mediated by a specific viewpoint.

	From the interplay of the various comic strips arises a polyphonic
narrative, a juxtaposition of different subjective instances. What the
juxtaposition of the various viewpoints in <em>Ice Haven</em> reveals is that
one cannot escape from his or her own subjective position and understanding
of the world. The rare attempts at communication are constantly thwarted by
misinterpretation.

	The would-be writer Vida, for instance, is a great admirer of the unknown
and frustrated poet Random Wilder, and tries to catch his attention by giving
him a zine she has written. Wilder is overwhelmed by its quality and
consequently loses every bit of his own artistic ambitions. He is so
disheartened that he “can’t bear to have it in the house” and tosses it in
the garbage, through which Vida later rummages. The discovery of her own zine
leads her to think that he found it completely worthless, and as a result she
drops her own literary dreams.

	<a

img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3128" title="ice_haven_01"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ice_haven_01.jpg"
alt="" width="813" height="298" /></a>

	The interplay of both viewpoints highlights the missed connexion between
two otherwise like-minded persons. While the reader benefits from an
"objective" overall perspective because he is able to juxtapose different
viewpoints, the characters remain enclosed in their comic strips.

	In <em>Ice Haven</em>, the constraints of the comic strip are used to
underpin the theme of alienation and disconnection; the comic strip does not
resist the representation of interior states, on the contrary, it defines it.
Yet, Sattler is right: here again, the story is struggling against comics
themselves, as the characters cannot escape the boundaries of their inner
world, delineated by the rigid format of the comic strip.

pretty lucky this year having a job that allowed me to live in Edinburgh for
the summer. For the month of August this city becomes 100 square miles of
awesome. My particular favourite part this summer was the Book Festival which
takes place in Charlotte Square in a collection of tents of all shapes and
sizes and comes replete with a bar, a Spiegeltent, deckchairs and two
bookshops. It is basically my idea of paradise.</p> <p>This year’s Book
Festival included a special Comics themed strand ‘Stripped’ which brought
comics creators such as Neil Gaiman, Joe Sacco, Chris Ware, Posy Simmonds and
Hannah Berry to talk about their works. There were also several cabaret style
events held in the Spiegeltent. One such event was the reappearance of <a
title="Literary Death Match" href="http://www.literarydeathmatch.com"
target="_blank">Literary Death Match</a> in Edinburgh. In case you’re not
familiar with the concept, Literary Death Match is basically like a gameshow
but with extra added books, this one had a Graphic Novel theme (I know, I
know, it really is the best thing ever). Authors are invited to read extracts
from their work, and they are then judged on ‘Literary Merit’, ‘Performance’
and ‘Intangibles’ by a panel of judges that on this occasion consisted of
Neil Gaiman, Dawn O’Porter and Craig Silvey. A winner advances from each
round to take part in the final, which on this momentous night was a game of
Graphic Novel Pictionary. Honestly, if Literary Death Match comes to a town
even vaguely near you, make the effort to go and see it.</p> <p>But on with
the post… It is the winner of this little slice of tremendousness that I
would like to talk about this week. This convoluted opening was merely a long
and hyperactive way of telling you that I had (unfortunately) not heard of
Amy Mason before this night, and now she is one of my new favourite things.
Amy Mason’s <em>The Islanders</em> is the graphic novel that accompanies the
 so-called lo-fi musical she, and her ex Eddie Argos, wrote about their
teenage romance and holiday to the Isle of Wight. Amy performs the text while
Eddie and Jim Moray perform the music. The book contains the script, song
lyrics and illustrations by Steven Horry. It also contains a link to download
the songs so you can listen along as you read.</p> <p><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-
17-at-23.14.42.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3153"
title="On stage the islanders"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-
17-at-23.14.42-300x230.png" alt="" width="300" height="230" /></a></p>
<p><em>The Islanders</em> is a relatively simple story, two teenagers fall in
love, one runs away to live with the other and they struggle along, not old
enough to know how to look after themselves, too much in love to always care.
Indeed this is one of the book’s great strengths, its evocation of young
love. I love the knowing but affectionate way in which Amy describes their
relationship. She manages to poke fun at their intensity without in any way
diminishing its importance. Amy’s description of the mix tapes they make one
another is one of my favourite passages from the book;</p> <p>“We made each
other mix-tape after mix-tape. ANGELICA, KENICKIE b-sides, CICCONE, BIS…
happy, upbeat, lo-fi songs that we could have written – about nonsense or
young people falling in <strong>LOVE.</strong></p> <p>The tapes had names.
‘<strong>AMY’S POP HITS’</strong> or <strong>‘EDDIE’S SPARKLE MIX’</strong>
but what we really meant was ‘Amy, <strong>LISTEN</strong> to these
<strong>SONGS </strong> and realize <strong>I LOVE YOU’</strong> and ‘Eddie,
let the <strong>SONGS</strong> on this tape <strong>CONVINCE</strong> you
that <strong>I AM AMAZING</strong> and agree to <strong>NEVER LEAVE
ME</strong>”.</p> <p>Meanwhile her description of what made her fall in love
with Eddie made me howl with laughter; “Eddie tells me he’s been on a journey
to a magical land, a place where Pez grows on trees. He’s taken a supply of
apples and gin to keep him going and received assistance from a friendly goat
to fight a MALICIOUS GOBLIN. So THIS is WHAT he’s LIKE. The letter tells me
ALL I NEED to KNOW From this point we are TOGETHER”.</p> <p>The central story
of this book, and a thread that holds it together, is the importance of
elsewhere to the young Amy and Eddie. To soothe the troubled Amy to sleep
Eddie incites her to imagine they are on a raft, away from their problems and
safe from everyone. When Amy gets a job in an advertising agency she is put
in charge of the ads for the Isle of Wight radio station, to her mind the
island is a placed filled with people “looking down, wide-eyed, at the sea,
while they hum nervously, listening to their wind up radios and weaving or
whittling, or whatever Island people do”. As her colleagues start to peel
away on their annual holidays, Amy starts to imagine that they might be the
kind of people that could go away on holiday, to this island where people
“have things to weave, things to whittle or whatever island people do…”. In
fact it is their trip to the Isle of Wight that proves the catalyst for their
eventual break up and their epiphany that they can move elsewhere, see other
things, have other jobs, love other people.</p> <p>Steven Horry’s
illustrations do a wonderful job of conveying quite how momentous a decision
it is for Amy who can rarely, according to her own confession, “get through a
full supermarket shop without having a nervous breakdown” to go on holiday
with Eddie. A full two page spread of the couple approaching the ferry to the
Isle of Wight is divided into four horizontal panels to convey their
indecision about running to make the ferry they are on the point of missing,
while the decision to print the first pages about their arrival on the island
in colour is a fantastic way to share with the reader the sensory overload
that Amy and Eddie are experiencing, contrasting sharply as it does with
their difficult home life.</p> <p><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-
17-at-20.45.30.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3150"
title="Hands The Islanders"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-
17-at-20.45.30.png" alt="" width="747" height="578" /></a></p> <p>The
narrative is interspersed with postcards sent by the older Eddie and Amy to
their younger selves, often witty, sometimes wistful and sad, these postcards
provide a neat summary of their relationship and their different takes on
this joint holiday. Amy cites one of her reasons for embarking on this
project her interest in the different ways in which she and Eddie remember
this holiday. Indeed she initially contacted him hoping he could fill in the
gaps in her patchy memories of the trip. Amy remembers a trip on a Galleon
ride at the island’s theme park as sending her into a flat panic as she
screamed and sobbed her way through it, in Eddie’s memories of the event “Amy
was crying with laughter the whole time. I haven’t seen her so happy in
ages”. These differences in their own memories of their holiday help flesh
out Amy and Eddie as characters within the book and bring to life their
younger selves for the reader.</p> <p>When they return from their holidays
Amy charts the swift downfall of their relationship, she and Eddie drift
further and further apart. Their arguments get worse, he proposes in the wake
of a row with a ring fashioned from tin foil. They run out of money and spend
Christmas Day in darkness, along in their flat, later she tries to break the
coffee table to use as fuel on the fire and they surround themselves with
friends and parties as they try to plug the holes in their relationship.</p>
<p><em>The Islanders</em> is one of the most poignant books I have read in
ages, it beautifully charts the rise and fall of young love and the way in
which it incorporates the various different narrative styles, song,
monologue, image, postcard, effectively creates a collage that reflects the
patchwork of memories that Amy and Eddie have cobbled together of this period
in their lives.</p> <p><a

		<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p
		dir="ltr">There are always new ways to experience comics. Last week
		Hattie mentioned <a
		href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2013/09/17/its-time-for-us-to-
		get-out-of-this-town-musings-on-the-islanders-by-amy-mason/"
		target="_blank">Literary Death Match</a>, a mixing of comics with
		performance which included live on-stage drawing. This is a subject
		close to my heart as I have hosted a few comics/art/performance
		events in Dundee under the banner DeeCAP. I have also written on
		comics and performance for <a
		href="http://comicsforum.org/2013/08/21/comics-and-performance-from-
		chalk-talks-to-carousel-by-damon-herd/" target="_blank">Comics
		Forum</a>. A few weeks earlier David wrote about <a
		href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2013/08/20/130-comics-the-
		internet-and-the-impossible-archive/" target="_blank">correlations
		between comics and the internet</a> and then Scott brought up <a
		href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2013/09/03/132-david-wongs-
		escape-to-gold-mountain-a-graphic-novel-in-the-history-classroom/"
		target="_blank">comics as educational tools</a>.</p> <p
		dir="ltr">However, sometimes is great just to go back to good old
		fashioned stapled pamphlets made from photocopied and folded sheets
		of A4 paper (near enough to letter size, North American readers).
		Recently there has been a resurgence in small press comics, whether
		this is a low-fi reaction against the acceptance of ‘graphic novels’
		as literary fare with their attendant hardback fanciness or a kicking
		against the digital pricks of publishers such as Comixology is still
		up for debate - in fact, it is probably a bit of both and more. As an
		aside, I was perfectly happy with my paperback copy of <em>Fun
		Home</em> so I was slightly disappointed that Alison Bechdel’s follow
		up book <em>Are you my Mother?</em> only came out in hardback. Hey
		comics, stop playing by someone else’s rules!</p> <p dir="ltr">This
		revival is perhaps best exemplified by Box Brown’s <a
		href="http://retrofitcomics.com/" target="_blank">Retrofit
		Comics</a>, who have been publishing ‘high quality staple-bound
		comics on a regular basis’ since 2011, and Charles Forsman with his
		micro-publishing empire <a href="http://oilycomics.com/"
		target="_blank">Oily Comics</a>. Both of these publishers write and
		draw comics themselves and this, alongside publishing other people’s
		work, helps to make sure the floppy survives distinct from monthly
		superhero titles.</p>

White, Raw Power 2 - Josh Bayer, Grand Gestures - Simon Moreton[/caption]

	Retrofit Comics come in a variety of sizes and paper stocks to suit the
individual author. <a href="http://smoo.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Simon
Moreton</a>’s minimalist <em>Grand Gestures</em> is slightly smaller than
standard comic book size and comes with a matt two-colour cover. <em>We Will
Remain</em> by <a href="http://whitecomics.tumblr.com/"
target="_blank">Andrew White</a> is slightly smaller with a full colour yet
muted cover, while <a href="http://joshbayerart.blogspot.co.uk/"
target="_blank">Josh Bayer</a>’s magazine sized <em>Raw Power 2</em> has a
garish day-glo glossy cover and is printed on newsprint, bringing to mind
comics like Peter Bagge’s Neat Stuff and punk fanzine Maximum Rocknroll.

	Forsman, a graduate of <a href="http://www.cartoonstudies.org/"
target="_blank">The Centre for Cartoon Studies</a> in Vermont, publishes Oily
Comics in that quarter letter size fanzine format that makes each book
exciting to grab a hold of and flick through the photocopied pages. There is
always a danger of a paper cut or roughly cut edges. The bluntness of the
Oily guillotine only adding to the materiality of these ephemeral little
booklets. Opening an envelope from Oily is always intriguing as I’m never
sure who will be featured; among my favourites so far are <em>Outside</em> by
<a href="http://oilyboutique.bigcartel.com/product/outside-2-3"
target="_blank">Marc Geddes</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.craghead.com/"
target="_blank">Warren Craghead</a>, <em>Lou</em> by <a
href="http://www.mmmendes.com/" target="_blank">Melissa Mendes</a>, and <a
href="http://joshuahallsimmons.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Josh
Simmons</a>’ <em>Training</em>.

Warren Craghead, Lou - Melissa Mendes, Middle Ground - Andy Burkholder,
Training - Josh Simmons, Not a Horse Girl - Marian Runk.[/caption]

	These comics are available in comics shops but, living in Scotland they
are hard to find, so I have subscriptions to both publishers ensuring regular
letterbox drops of comics. The internet and online payment companies make
ordering small press comics from around the world very, very simple - using
modern technology to get a fix of good old fashioned printed paper.
Interestingly both publishers also release digital versions of their comics,
although with Retrofit, I think only as an addition to the print
subscription. <p dir="ltr">The materiality is nothing though if the contents
are not up to scratch and so far neither publisher has disappointed, I may
like some comics more than others but they are always interesting. Perhaps
the most successful book so far is Forsman’s own <a
href="http://oilyboutique.bigcartel.com/category/teotfw"
target="_blank"><em>The End Of The Fucking World</em> </a>or <em>TEOTFW</em>.
Described on the cover as a blend of <em>Bonnie and Clyde</em> and
<em>Paranoid Park</em>, the minimally drawn tale mixes nihilistic teenage
boredom and crime, and looks to me like Terrence Malick’s <em>Badlands</em>
starring the cast of <em>Peanuts</em>.</p>


	[caption id="attachment_3178" align="alignleft" width="240"]<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/TEOTFW.woods_1.jpg">

240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" /></a> James &amp; Alyssa from
The End Of The Fucking World[/caption] <p dir="ltr">First serialised by Oily,
<em>TEOTFW</em> is now available in a collected edition from <a
href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/the-end-of-the-fucking-world-
teotfw-with-exclusive-signed-print.html" target="_blank">Fantagraphics</a>
and thankfully they haven’t messed with the format too much. The complete
edition is only about 10% larger than the original minis - still no bigger
than my hands. Being published by Fantagraphics feels like the mainstream
these days but <em>TEOTFW</em> has broken through even further; it was
recently <a href="http://blog.film4.com/film4-0-announce-new-films/"
target="_blank">announced</a> that the book is being made into a series of
internet shorts by the British broadcaster Film4.0.</p> These are exciting
times for small press comics, and this is being marked by Comics Forum with
their <a href="http://comicsforum.org/comics-forum-2013/"
target="_blank">Small Press and Undergrounds: A Conference on Comics</a> in
Leeds, UK in November. Graphixia will be in attendance to host a panel
discussing the work we have achieved so far, such as this blog and our
successful <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2013/06/12/comics-the-multimodal-world-
an-international-conference/" target="_blank"><em>Comics &amp; the Multimodal
World</em></a> conference in June this year, and then looking to the future.
The panel is titled <em>Small is the New Big: The Comics Criticism Blog as
Small Press</em>, we hope you can make it along.]]></content:encoded>

irritated by so many things. One of the things that gets to me is repetition,
especially when it comes in response to an opportunity for significant
change.

	A few qualifiers right off the bat: 1) this is not going to be a rant
about what I hate about a particular comic, but I will point to a particular
comic in order to make my case. The case applies to everything. 2) This isn’t
a rant, but a legitimate concern about how we define the legitimacy and
evolution of comics–however we define it. I’m not making a claim about how
we’ll define comics, if we’ll define comics, or that we need to define
comics.

	It begins and ends with Superman, because comics, to some extent, began
and will end with Superman. That character is always part of the
conversation. No matter how hard we try to get him out of the conversation,
there he is hiding in the phone booth, trying to change, only to emerge in
the same blueish suit, with some yellow accents, a cape–usually red–and that
massive “S” on his chest. And this is the point.

	Take DC comics–its moniker a lame rethinking of “<em>Detective
Comics</em>”–and their “<em>New 52</em>,” often referred to as a “reboot.”
Y’know “reboot” your computer? When it’s frozen and won’t work anymore, so
you start it up again in the hopes that it will return to normal again. You
sit there and you pray that everything will return to normal and not be all
screwed up and not working. You put absolute faith in that reboot getting you
back to exactly where you were when things were okay. You don’t do it so that
everything will change–that’s your worst nightmare. And herein lies the
problem with comics: they don’t change, they just say they’re changing.

width="300" height="464" /></a>

	With the <em>New 52</em>, DC had a real opportunity to revisit some of
its characters (I don’t need them to do it to all of them) and make some real
changes, but no. Even the inaugural cover harkens back to the original
Superman <em>Action Comics #1</em> as if to further entrench the “we’re
saying we’re changing! But don’t worry, we’re not changing just re-drawing!
See, you know Action Comics #1 right? This is the same only more close!” The
loss of the panicked guy in the lower left-hand corner of <em>Action Comics
#1</em> in the <em>New 52</em> meant that I couldn’t point to an apt symbol
for my own sarcastic reaction to the reboot. Suffice to say, that’s me
reacting to the idea that the <em>New 52</em> means anything but the same old
same old. Of course, most of the objection to the <em>New 52</em> is that it
does away with the numbers that connect the comics to the past: "don't
change!"

height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3233" /></a>

	Even the heroes themselves don’t change. Look at Supes and Batman and
Wonder Woman:

"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3234" alt="new-52-allheroes"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new-52-allheroes.jpg"
width="570" height="300" /></a>

	Pretty much the same as always. White, tall, handsome, muscled. How about
we take a look at the physics of living on a planet with huge gravity like
Krypton had, what effect would that have on the body. How big does Superman’s
chest have to be to accommodate a heart that can pump blood around a body
under that much gravitational pressure? Yeah, we’re gonna make him the same.
What would so much time in the water do too Aquaman’s hair? Would he have
hair? How would that work? Naw, a bald Aquaman will confuse our readers about
the intentions of the New 52. Wonder Woman: how does an Amazon woman really
look; how might a really fine muscled woman look? Ummmm, no. She has to be
sexy too.

	All this to say, that we like at times to sit around and laud comics for
being nostalgia, unchanging. I’ve even written about how comics actually do
really cool things within the constraints of repeated origin stories. Umberto
Eco wrote a really famous essay about how Superman stays the same and what
that means. In some ways, what’s great about comics is that they don’t
change. Peter Parker is still Peter Parker.

	That said, let’s stop talking about how Peter Parker was a really
innovative turn in character for comics. That was 1962. What’s changed? And
don’t say Venom–that’s just a colourist without colours. Some will gleefully
point to “The Graphic Novel” and “Slice of Life” comics. Or trot out the old
standards: <em>The Dark Knight</em>, <em>Watchmen</em>, and <em>Sin
City</em>; fantastic innovations all, but more refiguring of the same. The
bottom line is that the basic format of comics–even with its move to
digital–has not changed significantly since the beginning. Chris Ware, one of
the labelled “innovators” is commended for releasing a box full of references
to comics’ past and Art Spiegelman’s <em>Maus</em>, for all its triumphs,
still uses strict panel formats and alludes to the cat and mouse trope that
often defines the medium. After all our innovations, shifts, reboots, we’re
still dealing with “books,” “frames,” “gutters,” and I think, like the
rebooted computer screen, we’re happy to see things that way again.

	Perhaps being unchanging is part of becoming an established media. That
said, it also means nothing’s happening, nothing’s moving, nothing’s doing.
As we continue to debate comics’ legitimacy and assert its position as an
evolutionary medium that can respond to the cultural currents of our time, we
need to acknowledge its stasis. At some point, if comics is to be taken
seriously as a form of cultural representation or commentary, we’re going to
have to acknowledge that we need to move forward and really change things up
in a significant way, either in response to a mediated shift–ibooks!–or
because something else will come along–who plays video games anyway?–and
steals our resonance. Ctrl-Alt-Delete / Ctrl-Alt-Delete / Ctrl-Alt-Delete

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:
center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3273 aligncenter" alt="ch1-1"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ch1-1-300x137.jpg"
width="300" height="137" /></p> I have to admit that I do not have the same
issues with hatred as Peter and Brenna do, I am, on a relatively regular
basis, a great big ball of irrational rage and hatred. I once, on a similar
blog to this, dedicated many many hours and thousands of words to explaining
in great detail just how much I hated JJ Abrams and all his works. To this
day if plied with enough gin and wound up just enough I will recite that post
word for word at any poor, unsuspecting friend who happens to mention
<i>Lost</i> at just the wrong moment, (what can I say, I took
<i>Cloverfield</i> badly).

	Despite my love of a good chunk of righteous outrage and annoyance and my
propensity for hating on anyone who I deem to have chewed a bit too loudly,
breathed a bit too heavily or looked at my cat funnily, I have to admit to
having struggled to find something to hate for this post. My original reading
of the theme was that we were going to try to re-read something we had
previously hated or struggled with and look at why we had had that response
and to see whether engaging critically with our original response might help
us to appreciate the work.

	However, the rest of Team Graphixia seem to have picked specific things
that they hate and since I feel incapable of narrowing it down to just one I
am going to write a list. Whilst I would love to embark on a list entitled
“Hattie’s Hundred Hates” in which I list one hundred things I hate about
comics, I don’t quite have the time. So here’s my top ten (in no particular
order) to whet your appetite!

	&nbsp; <ol> <li>The fact that Wizard’s tagline was for sometime “The #1
Men’s Pop Culture Magazine”.</li> <li>The fact that you can’t state on the
internet that certain creators’ latest works are a.) a bit racist, b.) a bit
sexist, c.) not very good, d.) very bad indeed, without getting shouted at a
lot by people who are very resistant to reasoned debate.</li> <li>Rubbish
tie-in comics. I hate that comics are seen as a cheap and trendy thing to tie
into promotional efforts. For example the terrible mousemat I had to use at
my last job that depicted the efforts of the superheroes from our printing
suppliers who could provide all of our merchandise in a flash!</li>
<li>Comics shops that are so busy selling toys and tat that they hide their
comics away at the back of the shop. This does not make a pleasant shopping
experience and makes me about 12 times less likely to come and spend much of
my pay cheque in your shop.</li> <li>Gratuitously graphic violence/sexual
violence, just because you can draw or write a comic in which truly
horrendous things happen to people, doesn’t mean that you should. (Mark
Miller I am looking at you.)</li> <li> Crappy adaptations of classic literary
texts that have clearly been made just to exploit parents worried they will
never get their kids to read the GCSE set texts otherwise. Just because it’s
a comic doesn’t mean it is any easier to read than the original. If
Shakespeare’s plays are going to be adapted into comic book form then they
deserve to be done in the best possible way, with artists and writers that
have time and money to do them justice.</li> <li>People correcting themselves
when they ask if I am reading a comic by saying “Oh sorry, do <em>you</em>
prefer the term graphic novel” in a snide tone of voice. Normally I would
like to respond with a pithy “I would prefer you to go away” but I normally
mumble something about the term comics being fine and try to avoid making eye
contact with this person I now have to hate.</li> <li>The guided viewing
thing on digital comics viewers. I really, really, really dislike the motion
as it swoops and zooms from panel to panel. Firstly it makes me feel
nauseous; secondly I don’t like being told what to do/having my reading
controlled by a computer. (Why, yes I do have control issues).</li> <li>The
fact that even though I agree 100% with everything Brenna said last week I
still found myself justifying my existence as a comics scholar this
morning.</li> <li>Exclusive fandom, by which I mean, the kind of comics fans
who don’t seem to want to share something they love with their friends but
rather want to keep it to themselves. If I like something then I want
everyone I know and love to like it too, which is why I have purchased dozens
of copies of Michel Rabagliati books for friends’ birthdays and given Cheryl
Strayed’s Wild as a present three times in the last six weeks. I love comics,
I think some of my friends would really like some of my favourite comics, I
don’t expect them to pass an initiation test to prove that they are comics
fans before I will respect their opinions about the one, two, fifteen or
seventy comics that they have read and want to discuss with me. (P.S. I don’t
have a clue what colour Peter Parker’s shoes were in issue 43 of Spiderman
and I like comics so much that one day I am going to have written a whole PhD
about them).</li> </ol> &nbsp;

	So there you go, a fairly hefty list of Hattie’s Hates. I feel like I am
on such a roll now that I might even manage to make it one hundred after
all.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

<title>#142 Is it just me? My problem with Jeffrey Brown</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[As <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2013/11/13/hatties-hates/"
target="_blank">Hattie</a> remarked last week one of the ways in which we
Graphixians discussed engaging with the things we hate about comics was to
revisit a text that we had previously dismissed as uninteresting or that we
strongly disliked. In discussions with Graphixia guest poster <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2013/08/05/128-jeffrey-brown-grows-up-
maturity-adulthood-and-a-matter-of-life/" target="_blank">Paddy Johnston</a>
at the recent Transitions conference in London, he challenged me to look
again at a book that I had almost thrown across the room with rage when I
first read it (the only book I have actually throw across the room out of
sheer annoyance is Jonathan Franzen's <em>The Corrections</em>, a book that
may have suffered by being read immediately after Don DeLillo's
<em>Underworld</em>)

	I originally thought I would write about typography in comics this week.
One of my personal bugbears is the use of badly designed digital type with
hand-drawn artwork, which has such a jarring, distracting effect that it will
put me off what otherwise may be a decent comic. I say decent as such scant
attention to detail means to me that the comic can't be excellent. I'm not
against digital type, it can be used well and is often disguised as
handwriting, Graphixia interviewee <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t75n_AQUymw" target="_blank">Allan
Haverholm</a> is an expert in this <a href="http://haverholm.com/work/fonts/"
target="_blank">field</a>. However, I decided to take Paddy up on his
challenge and reread <a
href="http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog/clumsy/180"
target="_blank"><em>Clumsy</em></a> by Jeffrey Brown.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/photo-3.PNG.jpeg"><
img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3291" alt="photo 3.PNG"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/photo-3.PNG-194x300.
jpeg" width="194" height="300" /></a>

	What put me off Brown's comic in the first place? Hmmm, where to start...
 I am a huge fan of autobio comics, the first ones I came across were Dennis
Eichorn's <a href="http://boingboing.net/author/denniseichhorn"
target="_blank"><em>Real Stuff</em></a> and <a
href="http://www.maryfleener.com/covers/comic_covers.html"
target="_blank"><em>Slutburger</em> </a>by Mary Fleener. This led to Colin
Upton's <a href="http://www.colinupton.com/comics/bigthing/bigthing.html"
target="_blank"><em>Big Thing</em></a> and Harvey Pekar's <em>American
Splendor, </em>which I have written about <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2013/03/05/106-american-splendor-whats-
in-a-name/" target="_blank">before</a>. Over the years I have been impressed
by Eddie Campbell's <a
href="http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog/alec-the-years-have-pants/618"
target="_blank"><em>Alec</em></a> books, Julie Doucet's <a
href="http://www.drawnandquarterly.com/shopCatalogLong.php?st=art&amp;art=
a3dff7dd52e65a" target="_blank"><em>Dirty Plotte</em></a> and David B's <a
href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/12/biography.art"
target="_blank"><em>Epileptic</em></a> and more recently Ulli Lust's <em><a
href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/today-is-the-last-day-of-the-
rest-of-your-life.html?vmcchk=1" target="_blank">Today Is the Last Day of the
Rest of Your Life</a>,</em> and as I wrote on a recent post <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2013/04/23/113/"
target="_blank"><em>Susceptible</em></a> by Geneviève Castrée. One thing that
all these books have in common is a sense of a wider world outside the life
of the protagonist. In <em>Clumsy</em>, Brown seems to live in a vacuum of
his own life, we are told that the events take place in Michigan and Florida
but there is no sense of what exists there. This speaks of homogenisation in
the US but an author such as Castrée gives us a sense of the various
locations she inhabits in her book. There is a difference between Quebec
where she grows up and British Columbia where she visits her father “a
mythical kingdom where dads go to disappear”.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/photo-4.PNG.jpeg"><
img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3292" alt="photo 4.PNG"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/photo-4.PNG-190x300.
jpeg" width="190" height="300" /></a>

	Brown's book is the story of an adolescent relationship in all it's
intimate and dreary detail. Even a fan his work such as Paddy acknowledges
the reviews that state that this book is "emotionally about six years old". I
read <em>Clumsy</em> when it came out in 2002 and even then I was left with a
feeling that I was too old for this book and also Brown's follow up
<em>Unlikely</em>. They deal with such basic needy teenage emotions that I
just thought "so what? Get over yourself". Although the blurbs on the back
are full of praise by esteemed cartoonists James Kochalka and Chris Ware, who
are I think are older than I am. As much as I like them, I often think Ware's
books are emotionally stunted too, and he certainly positions himself in what
I would term the whiny school of comics. I also have the same problem with
Chris Thompson's <a
href="http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog/blankets-new-edition-softcover/762
" target="_blank"><em>Blankets</em></a>, another tale of teenage romance told
in way too much detail. Am I the only one that thinks Thompson needs an
editor? As if to accentuate the immaturity of his work, Brown's later books
reference <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Transformers</em>, ferchrissakes, is it
too much to ask to leave these childhood preoccupations behind? For the
record I hate <em>Star Wars </em>too and its place in culture as a collective
nostalgia and reference for childhood. In many ways I think these books are
just the product of white male middle class privilege, how about taking your
heads of out your posteriors and look around at the rest of the world.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/photo-2.PNG.jpeg"><
img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3290" alt="photo 2.PNG"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/photo-2.PNG-211x300.
jpeg" width="211" height="300" /></a>

	It is also worth examining the art style of Brown's book. In
<em>Clumsy</em>, he leaves in spelling mistakes and crossed out word edits.
Is this visible editing meant to lend an air of the authenticity? Is it just
laziness? I am not against a naive drawing style, it is possible for art to
look simplistic but be hiding more sophisticated skills, I'm thinking of
Eddie Campbell or Julie Doucet here, but I think Brown's panels of night time
scenes look more like they are taking place in the rain, which is poor visual
communication. Part of my problem may be the format of the book.
<em>Clumsy</em> is a 200 page perfect bound book and I think this elevates
expectations. If it was published in a series of fanzines or minicomics ala
Oily Comics, or other small press publishers, would I have had the same
expectations? That's not to say I have low expectations of Oily, as I wrote
<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2013/09/24/135-raw-power-grand-gestures-
thoughts-on-the-small-press-revival/" target="_blank">here</a> they are
publishing excellent work.

	This post has been written on the hoof as Graphixia is hosting two panels
this week on comics blogging as a small press analogue at University of the
Arts, London and at <a href="http://comicsforum.org/comics-forum-2013/"
target="_blank">Comics Forum</a> in Leeds but in revisiting <em>Clumsy</em>
it has only reinforced my dislike for the work and despite Paddy's
protestations I am very unlikely (ahem) to read any other book by Jeffrey
Brown.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2013/10/29/139-no-one-cares-about-your-
neuroses-and-other-tales/" target="_blank">Brenna</a>, I wouldn't have chosen
to write about things I <em>hate</em>. The term refers to a very strong,
negative emotion we reserve for extraordinary, hopefully exceptional
circumstances. Hate: there is already too much of it. As this is my first
post for <em>Graphixia</em>, I will try to stick to the brief whilst
hopefully managing to re-focus the post towards something positive.

	Not liking things is different to hating. There are many things I don't
like. This means I wish these things were different. When I say "I wish they
were different" it means that an <em>a priori</em> for that feeling is an
intuition that something can be done about it. Many times we face situations
we dislike that are not really the consequences of our conscious acts, or
which we are (or feel that we are) not directly responsible for. There are
problems whose roots are beyond our realm of immediate influence. In those
cases it is easier to change our attitude or reaction to the circumstances we
dislike, because there is really not much we can do to change those
circumstances. There are other cases, however, in which things we dislike can
actually, pragmatically, be changed. This means we can change them from
something we dislike to something we actually feel comfortable with.

	This takes me to finally writing about things I dislike that I think I
(we) can do something to change. These "things" are interconnected in my
mind. What I dislike is lack of openness. For me openness is related to
generosity, reciprocity, fairness. And these three terms are related to the
concept of access. In this sense what I dislike is closeness, lack of
response or feedback, self-centeredness and inequality. What do these things
have to do with comics?

	Let me tell you a story, then. A personal one. I am only able to tell you
this story, here, right now, because in my life I have been lucky and
privileged enough to have access to a series of fortunate circumstances, one
of which is an education. [No, we were not and have never been wealthy]. I
was born in Mexico and I am a native Spanish speaker. When I was growing up,
Mexico [this was the early 1980s]  was not unlike countries from the former
Eastern Block during the Cold War era. Or so it felt to many of us, who did
not have access to many books, records and magazines that we somehow had an
idea that existed but that we coudln't get hold of. When I was a kid one book
shop in Mexico City where my parents religiously took me and my brother every
Sunday stocked <em>Asterix</em> books. The albums were prominently displayed
in one of the tables at the main entrance. [These were Spanish editions,
translated, published and printed in Spain]. My father was not entirely sure
<em>Asterix</em> was "good for us" (he mainly disliked the drawings...
perhaps he saw himself in them, as his nose is not dissimilar to Uderzo's
Caesar's nose).  My mom however humoured us and eventually bought us [at
great expense, often saving in secret for it] the whole collection, which I
still treasure and re-read again and again and again.

	My dad, a civil engineer, got us to like American magazines (for years he
was subscribed to <em>Popular Mechanics</em>,<em> Discover</em> and
<em>National Geographic</em>, and I bizarrely have blurry memories of him
bringing copies of <em>Es</em><em>quire</em> from his work trips to
Monterrey) and I liked to collect the computer adverts on those. It's there I
guess where I first started reading in English. We also took English at
school (about an hour every day) but it was reading magazines how I really
got to practice it and expand my vocabulary. A bit later, as a teenager one
of my favourite places to hang out (by myself) was the<a
title="http://www.usembassy-mexico.gov/bbf/biblioteca.htm"
href="http://www.usembassy-mexico.gov/bbf/biblioteca.htm" target="_blank">
Bejamin Franklin Library</a> in Mexico City. There I could read, for free,
the <em>New Yorker </em>and the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, and basically
devoured every fiction book they had, including some comics. Had I not had
free access to this library, I wouldn't be writing this in English right now,
and most surely my life would be very different from what it is now.

	For most of the years in which I was an undergraduate at the <a
title="http://www.unam.mx/" href="http://www.unam.mx/"
target="_blank">National University in Mexico</a> (courses take longer back
there) there was no Web, and most of us had access to resources in photocopy
only. Everything was photocopied. As a student and as a tutor you could not
assume everyone would be able to buy a given book, or that there would be
enough copies in the libraries. Many tutors brought books from their trips
abroad (no expenses claimed) and photocopied everything for their students. I
remember bringing books back like one would smuggle banned goods. To date, my
friends return home from their trips to the UK like culture trafficants,
loaded with books, records and DVDs.

	I hope this brief anecdote illustrates a little bit why I care so much
about open access to scholarly research. There are of course many other
reasons why I think open access to scholarly resources online is important,
but I cannot dwell in that here right now. (I have done that <a
title="http://blogs.city.ac.uk/epriego/2013/10/21/open-access-towards-fairer-
access-to-research/"
href="http://blogs.city.ac.uk/epriego/2013/10/21/open-access-towards-fairer-
access-to-research/" target="_blank">elsewhere</a>). My (probably
embarrassing) personal anecdote hopefully transmits the idea that I am now
who I am because I had access to information. The information I had access to
and the information I did not have access to defined me as a person. Of
course I had to be interested in accessing that information in the first
place, but had I faced a "computer says no" or "buy access here now", my life
would have been completely different, in a completely negative kind of way.

	Comics studies or comics scholarship is an academic field or academic
professional area that still makes most academics raise an eyebrow. If
academic research in general is often perceived as incomprehensible Ivory
Tower hyperspecialisation (not to say elitist snobbery), comics studies
research is a niche within a niche. In the case of comics studies, however,
the object of study is an art form/language/means of expression/cultural
expression/whatever that belongs to popular culture. Non-academics love
comics with a passion. It is in fact pathetic that something like that should
be clarified, that the specialised appreciation (study) of comics is not
exclusive of those in academia.

	Making research about comics available openly implies an act of
generosity because it implies that authors and publishers are thinking of all
types of readers, not only those lucky enough to be affiliated/have access to
institutions or libraries that pay for access to that research (institutions
pay so their members do not have to). When a piece of research is only
available to institutions/consortia of institutions that pay a subscription,
interested members of the public get the message they have to pay a hefty fee
(or find a public library that subscribes to that resource; <a
title="http://www.researchresearch.com/index.php?option=com_news&amp;template
=rr_2col&amp;view=article&amp;articleId=1339874"
href="http://www.researchresearch.com/index.php?option=com_news&amp;template=
rr_2col&amp;view=article&amp;articleId=1339874" target="_blank">it is
estimated</a> that UK universities paid £150 million in journal subscriptions
in 2010). This increases the friction between user's interest and accessing
the research. It seems to me that we all could try harder to make academic
research less difficult to access. This is where Open Access [<a
title="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/
9780262517638_Open_Access_PDF_Version.pdf"
href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/
9780262517638_Open_Access_PDF_Version.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>] comes in.

	For me personally writing is about communicating. Community, communion,
communication: it is not only about being read, but about creating
connections and enabling dialogue. At the moment the current state of
academic publishing leaves me very unhappy because it does not look to me
like it's trying harder to ensure the research academics get paid to publish
by their institutions and/or funders (including the government in many cases)
is openly available to those who are not academics, and perhaps more
importantly to those who are not academics in the wealthiest institutions of
the wealthiest countries. Perhaps "Joe Public" (supposing he exists) will not
be interested in reading academic research on comics. But why would we
prejudge that? Who are we to predetermine who is to be interested in what we
do? [And especially when "Joe Public" has paid taxes that have helped some of
that research be conducted and eventually published?]

	Openness to me is like an extended handshake. It is an offering. It means
that even if the offering might be received with disinterest, or silence, or
doubt, or suspicion, the offering remains. Openness allows a space for
reciprocity, but it cannot guarantee it. It will sound hippie and naïve and
maybe stupid to many, but openness is an expression of love. This does not
mean it's all done for selflessness. Far from it. Openness means love for the
work we do, because we want it to be accessible as widely as possible. It
means, too, a form of love for our academic colleagues, whom we hope will be
interested and will find it directly useful, and love for the unknown Other,
non-academics and young people and parents and grandchildren and whatnot,
regular people who might or might not be interested, but who will face an
open invitation and not a closed door.

	My arguments for Open Access in academic publishing are not just
touchy-feely, they are very pragmatic and stem from what I and others
perceive to be the current situation in academia. The traditional system of
academic publishing has encouraged a culture in which academics publish to
get jobs, and in some cases this has led to a sad case in which a happy bunch
of academics read other happy few academics but no one else does. Changing
this culture is more complicated than changing access or distribution
-business- models, as it implies a profound transformation of the public
reception, understanding, valorisation and re-use of academic research
outside academia itself. I really dislike that in the age of the <em>World
Wide</em> Web, academic culture <em>in general</em> seems still very
provincial, assuming everyone has the same level of privilege than everybody
else, as if <em>everybody</em> could just grab a plane and spend a month
living in London to do research at the British Library. (Sorry for italics
excess, but hey, we were asked to rant...).

	Academics do not need to sell individual copies of the journals they
publish articles in, and with a few exceptions the royalties from academic
monographs are frankly negligible. Most academics don't really publish for
money (i.e., academics don't make money depending on how many individual
copies of their work they sale). Academics however publish because that's
what they are supposed to do,  and at the moment the only ones making money
from the work academic publish are publishers. I dislike the fact authors
have been practically alienated from the product of their labour by these
commercial publishers, who get authors to accept licensing conditions that
potentially and practically limit how authors can distribute their own work.
At the moment it looks like academic reputation is de facto defined by who is
excluded from it. Openness is meant to offer a template for inclusion.

	The pragmatic obstacles are financial, infrastructural and cultural. The
challenges are huge, and most existing Open Access options are indeed not
ideal and undergoing important transformations. Academics need jobs, and on
the one hand we are told that public impact and all forms of impact matter,
but at the same time we are constantly told to do things as if the Internet
had never been invented.  Working towards increasing fairer access to
research is not about "destroying academia as we know it", on the contrary,
it is about working to ensure academic research achieves its purpose of
contributing to society in a fairer, less elitistic kind of way.

	The brief for this post was to write about hate, and I chose to write
about openness as an expression of love. I may have failed at it --I know it
is too long-- and you might have totally <em>hated</em> this post, but here
it is, for free, for you, to read and reuse, and do whatever you wish with
it. Think of it this way: at least you didn't have to pay for it.

<title>#144 Jeffrey Brown’s School for Whiny Children, or Why Whiny Comics
are OK Sometimes</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><span
style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></p> <p dir="ltr">Damon Herd’s recent
critique of Jeffrey Brown in these pages has made me feel strange. When Damon
asked Jeffrey Brown (not to his face)<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2013/11/20/142-jeffrey-fricking-brown/">
to get over himself</a>, I wondered perhaps if I needed to do the same. Is
the connection I feel to Brown’s books one rooted in solipsism, and am I in
fact a childish, self-indulgent fool?</p> <p dir="ltr"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/JB1.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3345" alt="JB1"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/JB1.jpg" width="610"
height="613" /></a></p> <p dir="ltr">Perhaps there is a part of my
personality that is like that, and identifies with Jeffrey Brown on that
simple level of sharing a desire to whine and think “<a
href="http://youtu.be/u6zIgka5-0Y">woe is me</a>,” But, as I said to Peter
Wilkins at this year’s<a href="http://comicsforum.org/"> Comics Forum</a>
conference in Leeds, I think it’s OK to have a whine every once in a while,
as long as you don’t do it frequently enough to become a whiny person. In the
same way, I think it’s OK to enjoy whiny comics, as long as you read them as
part of a balanced comics diet.</p> <p dir="ltr">My love of Jeffrey Brown
certainly comes down to personal circumstance, as he was responsible for
getting me into comics seriously as an adult after a shameful period of
ignoring them in my teens. I discovered his work when I was a whiny
undergraduate, between relationships and obsessing over girls who didn’t want
to go out with me, and I felt like his books (with titles like Every Girl is
The End of the World For Me) were made for me. He was in the right place at
the right time – I found his books full of warmth, humour and humanity, all
of which were absent from the mainstream Marvel and DC comics I’d struggled
to enjoy up until that point. I discovered a lot of the cartoonists I love
today through Jeffrey Brown, and fell in love with the form all over again as
a result of reading Clumsy. Rediscovering the art form of comics as an adult
was a joy like no other, and Jeffrey Brown kickstarted this.</p> <p
dir="ltr"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/endoftheworld_lg.gif
"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3346" alt="endoftheworld_lg"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/endoftheworld_lg.gif"
width="550" height="549" /></a></p> <p dir="ltr">Damon was right to criticise
the art of Jeffrey Brown’s Clumsy and to point out that it contains many
examples of poor visual communication. I think it treads the line between bad
communication and the raw honesty of leaving in the mistakes quite
precariously. When I first read Clumsy I loved that the mistakes were left in
and that some techniques were obviously underdeveloped because this made
Brown seem endearingly fallible and human. Re-reading it recently I did find
myself more critical of the art and less receptive to this emotional
connection, but it was still there.</p> <p dir="ltr">Most significantly, the
underdeveloped nature of Jeffrey Brown’s art made me think that this was
something I could do too. I’d read comics like<a
href="http://scarygoround.com/sgr"> Scary Go Round</a> and wanted to make art
like that, but I thought it would take years of training and significant
effort and I recalled that I’d never had much luck with art pedagogy at the
hands of some terrible schoolteachers, so I didn’t think I was likely to
succeed. I’d also just started an MA in Creative Writing, so I was set on the
path to becoming a writer. However, when I got really into comics again I
thought I could make them because Jeffrey Brown had managed to do so with an
attainably low level of skill. Now, I don’t subscribe fully to James
Kochalka’s “<a
href="http://www.tcj.com/blood-and-thunder-craft-is-the-enemy/">Craft is the
Enemy</a>” ideal and I think it’s very important to become skilled and to
hone your craft however you can, as well as learning the technical and
material concerns of it in as much detail as possible. But Jeffrey Brown,
with his emphasis on expression, gave me the starting point for all of this.
He was the springboard. Were it not for Jeffrey Brown, I wouldn’t have put
pen to paper and made the first comics I ever made, an appallingly drawn
autobiographical webcomic called Low Fidelity, which thankfully no longer
exists and which I have removed all traces of. I also then went on to write
and draw a graphic novel for my MA thesis, which is available as a PDF on my
website, but I’m really embarrassed by it now because I’ve developed my style
in comics a lot more since then and am still learning and fine-tuning my
craft, which I think still has some way to go but will eventually develop to
a level I’m happy with.</p> <p dir="ltr">I’ve come a long way with my style
and so has Jeffrey Brown throughout his career. As I wrote in my previous
blog post, his latest autobiographical book A Matter of Life is drawn in a
fine, well-executed style, in full colour, and is certified whine-free. I
would suggest that if Damon were to give Brown one more try, that this book
might be the one to read, though Funny Misshapen Body deals with the thorny
issue of comics in art school with an elegant critique so that might also be
of interest. Let’s not talk about Star Wars.</p> <p dir="ltr">I realise I’ve
made this post more of a blog about my own sentimental attachment to Jeffrey
Brown than a true riposte, but I think this goes some way to explaining our
differences of opinion, as well as the popularity of the “whiny school,” most
notably Chris Ware. Jeffrey Brown’s rawness, mistakes and lack of polish are
easy to connect with because we all make mistakes. In reading books like
Clumsy and Unlikely we can come to terms with this and place our own lives in
perspective. While there was necessary bite in Douglas Wolk’s comment that
Chris Ware’s works have “an emotional range of one note,” (in his book
Reading Comics) you can find a huge emotional range in whiny comics if you
read them closely, particularly Ware’s comics, which showcase just about
every emotion under the sun and are highly nuanced and complex if you can
look past the whining.</p> <p dir="ltr">Whining in comics can be a drag, sure
– but sometimes you need to have a whine and to get self-indulgent, and
Jeffrey Brown offers comics that can help with this. I see them as like Ben
&amp; Jerry’s – to be consumed as a treat every once in a while, and only as
part of a balanced diet. Having said that, I do eat a lot of ice cream.</p>

<title>#145 Collaboration: Love not Work? </title>
<link>http://www.graphixia.ca/2013/12/145-collaboration-love-not-work/</link>
<pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2013 04:45:37 +0000</pubDate>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[This post on
collaboration is guided entirely by serendipity. It came together out of the
books and blog posts I was reading, tweets I’d seen, and podcasts I’d
listened to. I went from a state of “what do I have to say about
collaboration?” to having a surfeit of material that I’m not sure coheres
into a single point. What I’m concerned about here is the relationship
between the “labour of love” that collaborators share and wage labour,
whether all “work” that one does with others necessarily gets co-opted by an
exploitative capitalist system. What are the ethics of working together?

	The provocation for these questions comes from reading about the “Comix
Factory”: various sociological analyses of comics as cultural work, coming on
the heels of a panel presentations at Comics Forum 2013 in Leeds and at the
University of the Arts, London, in which I and other members of the Graphixia
team extolled the virtues of DIY collaboration as an antidote to conventional
academic publishing, particularly on the subject of comics criticism, which,
I argued, had the obligation to question and disrupt academic practices in
the arts because it was a new discipline.

	Roger Sabin, one of our hosts at UAL, one of the finest critics of comics
in the world, and author of a book on punk rock, asked if we wanted to
destroy academia as it was currently structured. Instead of saying “yes,” I
admitted that there was a lot of having our cake and eating it too in our
arguments.

	On returning home from the UK, I read Casey Brienza’s recent post in <a
href="http://comicsforum.org/2013/12/02/comics-and-cultural-work-introduction
-by-casey-brienza/">Comics Forum</a>, the blog that runs in conjunction with
the conference we had just attended. Brienza discusses sociologist Howard
Becker on collaborative labour being essential to artistic production. She
writes: <blockquote>Comic art is no exception to Becker’s basic insight.
Writers, illustrators, graphic designers, letterers, editors, printers,
typesetters, publicists, publishers, distributors, retailers, and countless
others are both directly and indirectly involved in the creative production
of what is commonly thought of as the comic book.</blockquote> The comic book
is a product of cultural “work,” a somewhat factory-like distribution of
labour. Indeed, Brienza compares it, albeit loosely, to the production of an
iPhone. Brienza argues that comics scholarship is too dominated by literary
critics who tend to celebrate an “auteur” theory of comics production. A
sociological approach, she suggests, would emphasize instead the network of
people necessary to produce a comic and interrogate whether or not the
process was exploitative, and, if so, how.

	I think that what Brienza has to say is true but somehow disheartening.
We are used to thinking of DC and Marvel in these terms, but I suppose they
also apply to Fantagraphics and Drawn &amp; Quarterly: as long as people are
selling comics art to make money, even if it’s not enough money, they are
entering into the network or labour and in so doing they exit the world of
art as pleasure. Aesthetics gives way to economics.

	At Comics Forum 2013, I had the pleasure of <a
title="http://vimeo.com/81199162" href="http://vimeo.com/81199162"
target="_blank">interviewing</a> <a title="http://www.paulgravett.com/"
href="http://www.paulgravett.com/">Paul Gravett</a> about his new book
<em>Comics Art</em> and attending a launch event for the book at Travelling
Man in Leeds. The cover of <em>Comics Art</em> features a page from the Dutch
artist, Joost Swarte. It depicts a scene from a “Comix Factory” as the
letters on the window show. It features over 10 people (nearly all men!)
working away at different elements of the process of producing a comic.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Swarte.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3355" alt="Swarte"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Swarte.jpg"
width="951" height="1223" /></a>

	Three different versions of Swarte’s character Jopo de Pojo sit around
waiting. One is having his hair styled. A photographer talks to a man in a
three-piece suit who looks like a big shot. Painters work on backgrounds,
narrative boxes and speech bubbles. A couple appears to be making out in the
WC.

	Swarte appears to be both acknowledging and mocking Brienza’s notion of
comics as cultural work at the same time. But the scene is not realistic.
Comics are not put together on big boards on scaffolds with live actors and
then photographed. The multiple laborers involved in producing Swarte’s
comics are not the ones pictured in the image. The people in Brienza’s list
remain hidden.

	As Gravett notes, this scene is more like a movie set, from whence we get
both our “auteur” term and the most illuminating example of the network of
labour producing art, names assembled in the end credits, streaming by so
quickly that we cannot read them, the workers the auteur assembles to
accomplish his or her vision. One wishes to ask Swarte, why show these
fantasy constructs and not the real people who work to produce your comics?

	Perhaps the answer lies with the writer, or <em>auteur</em>, who toils
away in the bottom left corner of the picture, decentred, looking desperate
to get something together before the girder suspended over his head labelled
“deadline” drops on him. Maybe the labour going on around him represents a
wish fulfillment fantasy: if only so many people were sharing the labour of
putting this thing together. But the writer on this page shows less a sense
of cool mastery than one of anxiety and responsibility. The others are not
working with him but for whoever is footing the bill. So we see here the
double-sided sword of the creative process: the desire for someone to share
the work coupled with the fear of a factory-like work setting. For someone
like Swarte, the sociological, economic model of comics production is a kind
of nightmare, a system gone wrong.

	When I think about what Brienza is talking about, I feel a bit
nightmarish myself. At Graphixia, we see ourselves as working on the margins
of the system of labour. We are all academics working and/or studying within
institutions, and yet our collaboration on the blog seems only tangentially
tied to that work. It helps us apply for funding and get a certain kind of
recognition, but it is “off the side of our desks” as people say about work
they do in their spare time. Surely, we could not be co-opted into an
exploitative system?

	But then I read a tweet from Ben Woo, whom I follow on twitter and who is
the second up in the writers on comics and sociology for Comics Forum. Woo
was at at a <a
href="http://www.ua.ac.be/main.aspx?c=*UCSIAENG2&amp;n=112748">workshop on
youth cultures</a> in Belgium, tweeting a presentation from <a
href="http://www.mqup.ca/blog/interview-miranda-campbell-author-basement/">
Miranda Campbell</a>:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Ben-Woo-Campbell-
Tweet.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3357" alt="Ben Woo
Campbell Tweet"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Ben-Woo-Campbell-
Tweet.jpg" width="777" height="132" /></a>

	Suddenly it ocurred to me that at Graphixia we might not be dismantling
academia at all. Rather, we could simply be reinforcing what we feel we are
struggling against. What if we are just supplying a kind of unpaid labour to
the academic system?

	Fortunately, I listened to an episode of the <em>Inkstuds</em> podcast
that reminded me that there was more to the social than the economics of
labour. This episode featured Joann Sfar, author of <a
title="http://knopfdoubleday.com/book/164515/the-rabbis-cat/"
href="http://knopfdoubleday.com/book/164515/the-rabbis-cat/"><em>The Rabbi’s
Cat</em></a> and erstwhile member of the French L’association group (whose <a
title="http://www.tcj.com/a-house-divided-the-crisis-at-l%E2%80%99association
-part-1-of-2/"
href="http://www.tcj.com/a-house-divided-the-crisis-at-l%E2%80%99association-
part-1-of-2/" target="_blank">history</a>  shows some of the perils of
collaborative work in the market place). Sfar had the most wonderful things
to say about collaboration, that working with someone else is just plain fun:
you get drunk together and draw and write together. He also said that when he
was writing material for his friend Lewis Trondheim to draw, he wrote to make
him happy–not to fit his artistic sensibilities but to make him happy as a
person. Trondheim likes to draw fights and beautiful women, so Sfar obliges
him. This struck me as the most ethical and aesthetic approach to
collaboration possible: give pleasure, make someone else happy. This is what
I strive for with my fellow Graphixians, and it’s what I see artists striving
for when they contribute to <a title="http://comicsworkbook.tumblr.com/"
href="http://comicsworkbook.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"><em>Comics
Workbook</em></a>, <a title="http://teamweirdcomics.tumblr.com/"
href="http://teamweirdcomics.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"><em>Team Weird
Comics</em></a>, or just draw back and forth to each other. Sure they would
like to make money for their work and thus enter into the world of labour and
capital, but in the absence of that they create work for each other out of
love.

	Goodness knows collaboration and DIY publishing isn’t easy. People who
work together often fall out. People who once strove to make each other happy
end up hating each other or working together begrudgingly. Look at John
Lennon and Paul McCartney, for instance, and consider all the bands who
started out having fun and ended up not speaking to each other often because
of the impact of labour and market forces upon them. Still, for a brief
moment, the magic of working to make someone else happy eclipses all else.

	So, just as we should heed Brienza’s call for a sociological analysis of
the production of comics, we should also consider an analysis of the
pleasures of working with others out of love. For this too is a neglected
realm of comics scholarship.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Very interesting piece. I think a nice step
towards scholarly work that mingles Brienza's sociological approach with a
close attention to the 'pleasures of working with others out of love' is Jeet
Heer's book on Françoise Mouly, 'In Love with Art'. It reveals the
overwhelming attention given to the 'auteur', as Spiegelman is often
overshadowing his wife's role in editing and publishing RAW, and makes up for
it by analyzing Mouly's important contributions to the history of comics.
Jeet Heer makes an insightful analysis of the (creative) role of the editor,
and of the power relationships structuring discourse in comics scholarship
(in this case related to a kind of sexism). But he also sheds light on the
love story that lies behind this fruitful collaboration, and how RAW came out
of the strong two-way relationship between Spiegelman and
Mouly.]]></wp:comment_content> <wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved>

	I appreciate your hesitancy about the possibility of an economic
reductionism. Bourdieu addresses this in his essay "The Production of
Belief," where he notes that reducing the production of culture to *either*
brute economics *or* free creativity distorts what's really going on, which
is a productive (and constraining) tension *between* art and commerce or, if
you will, love and money. The denial of either by the principals is an
affirmation of their complex interaction.]]></wp:comment_content>

Culture of Collaboration as Public Good</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[When we encounter
discussions of collaboration, there is a natural tendency to gravitate toward
a conversation about practice and the process behind comic book production.
However, we should be wary of such practice-centred approaches because
comics, as they often do, occupy a problematic space when it comes to
representing a collaborative endeavour. Indeed, comics are so intertwined in
the various machinations of our cultural expression and the collusion–not
collaboration–that governs that expression, they offer up a different way of
thinking about the nature and representation of collaboration.

	Recently, the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy’s assassination has
been a topic of reflection. Along with that reflection was the auctioning of
Curt Swan’s <a
href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/jfk-superman-comic-book-art-sells-for-112k-
in-u-s-1.2438818" target="_blank">original artwork for Action Comics #308</a>
and DC’s <a
href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/12/16/dc-entertainment-fulfills-al-
plastinos-wish-for-the-jfk-superman-pages/" target="_blank">purchase, and
subsequent donation to the Kennedy Library, of Al Plastino’s original
artwork</a> for Superman #180. Both these events are full of the usual
meanderings and musings about the value of original artwork, missing issues
and so on – you can look up the backstory yourself. What’s interesting for
our purposes here is the way both of these issues suggest a different type of
collaboration or, more precisely, collaboration as cultural collusion for the
public good. In <em>Action Comics #308</em>, President Kennedy stands in for
Clark Kent to protect Superman’s secret identity. What’s made evident by this
story, if it wasn’t evident already, is the collusion between Westernized
cultural enterprizes that value secrecy over transparency. It’s a timely
commentary that we now read Superman’s declaration at the end of the comic as
rich in irony.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/graphixia_146-5.jpg"
><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3365" alt="graphixia_146-5"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/graphixia_146-5.jpg"
width="671" height="922" /></a>

	Point is, comics, perhaps more than any other medium, are directly
implicated in furthering a cultural hegemony. In effect, The President of the
United States of Freedom is collaborating with Superman to keep a secret from
all of us so we can go on oblivious to the machinations that revolve around
us.

	Lest there be declarations of conspiracy theories, <em>Superman
#180</em>–drawn by Al Plastino–represents a more positive collaboration
between systems of power and comics. In this issue, Superman is enlisted to
help further Kennedy’s fitness program. He does so willingly of course, and
it would seem the cause is just.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/grpahixia_146-3.gif"
><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/grpahixia_146-3.gif"
alt="grpahixia_146-3" width="576" height="789" class="aligncenter size-full
wp-image-3367" /></a>

	Problem is that even this collaboration marks the kind of philosophical
collusion that demonizes the new in favour of resuscitating and entrenching a
conservative agenda that again reflects the dominant cultural hegemony. In
other words, while all this is painted as a collaboration to make good things
happen, on a deeper level it represents a kind of collusion designed to
devalue the innovations Superman supersedes and represents. He comes to his
great fitness by happenstance of birth and the luck of getting off a dying
planet, not through hard work--he's part of the problem!!. Then there’s the
little pun that shows Superman’s complicit involvement in the politics of
closing the “missile” gap, but moving on. Collaboration in the way it is
represented here is both on the page and in the making. Superman is sent to
physically dictate a cultural shift toward physical fitness–its collaborative
propaganda.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/graphixia_146-6.jpg"
><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/graphixia_146-6.jpg"
alt="graphixia_146-6" width="645" height="962" class="aligncenter size-full
wp-image-3366" /></a>

	Which brings me to the above–the collaborative approval statement.
Superman #180 borrows the language of the Comics Code Authority for its
splash page. The Presidential seal replaces the Comics Code Authority seal,
but the sentiment, one that represents a supposedly rigorous collaboratory
approval process, is the same. There’s lots of literature about the Comics
Code, but the important point here is that the Code–and the seal that
represents it–is a signal of collaboration. It suggests a singular mindset
that will protect us, like Superman, from all the horrors that cultural
expression has to offer. After all, the code is a collaborative endeavour by
the major comics publishers to push back against the cultural hegemony that
would wish to censor them and their content. It’s a tactic developed in
Hollywood a transposed to comics. But again, it’s comics collaboration as
collusion.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/grpahixia_146-7.gif"
><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/grpahixia_146-7.gif"
alt="grpahixia_146-7" width="172" height="209" class="aligncenter size-full
wp-image-3368" /></a>

	If the above all seems real obvious, it is: we’re used to seeing things
overtly now. Porn is everywhere; it’s not illicit anymore–as A<a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv9SvjSNpoM" target="_blank">nthony
Bourdain has eloquently demonstrated</a>, even the Food Network is just porn
with food–comics regularly push the boundaries of taste (and good for them!),
and our cultural production is dominated by the vacuous but riveting
discourse of The Kardashians and their clones. All of these commentaries
reflect a collaborative enterprize between our evolving culture and
industries that seek to represent it so that it is palatable.That said, our
cultural production has never been more openly collaborative. Facebook
represents a collective archival and ongoing cultural discourse unlike
anything the world has yet seen (Like Us!).

	All this to say that it’s important not to get too focused on the role
collaboration plays in the production and practice of comics. If
collaboration means to work with someone to make something, then there are
plenty of open spaces where we can think about how collaboration manifests
itself. With comics, the intersection of cooperation (Avengers, Justice
League, Fantastic Four), collaboration (drafting, drawing, painting, inking,
writing, renewing, reinventing) and collusion (Comics Code, political
agendas, propaganda) is a busy one often causing collisions that drive our
representation of contemporary culture.]]></content:encoded>

Happy!* Here at <i>Graphixia</i>, we've been thinking about the end of the
year and reflecting on what has been in comics, both personally and in the
industry. This post collects some of our thoughts on the year that was 2013.

	<strong>Best Comic Published in 2013:</strong> <p style="text-align:

<em></em><em>Peter: <strong>Marble Season </strong></em><strong>by Gilbert
Hernandez (Fantagraphics).</strong> Gilbert comes up with an amazing
coming-of age comic to put himself back in contention for best Hernanzez
brother. As if it were a contest. (Honourable mention to <em>Bandette</em> by
Paul Tobin and Colleen Coover [Monkey Brain] and <em>Violenzia</em> by
Richard Sala [Fantagraphics].)

	<em>Dave: <strong>Hawkeye </strong></em><strong>#11 - The Pizza Dog
Issue</strong><em><strong>.</strong> </em>The most innovative comic in a long
time from one of the best storylines in comics today by the best creative
team (Fraction / Aja / Hollingsworth) since Watchmen.

	<em>Brenna: <strong>Letter</strong></em><strong> <em>44 </em> by Alberto
Alburquerque and Charles Soule.</strong> A late entry for 2013 but I am
already so gripped by this new series from Oni. I love the concept, I love
the dialogue, I love the old-school-style art. Fab.

	<em>Hattie: </em><strong>Miriam Katin's <em>Letting it
Go</em>.</strong> Honestly, this was joint favourite with
<em>Susceptible</em> by Genevieve Castree as mentioned by Damon, but since
he's nabbed that one I'll go with Katin's moving account of her struggles to
reconcile herself to the idea of her adult son moving to Berlin. I adored
this book and have reread it several times over recent months. The art is
beautiful and I found myself profoundly moved by Katin's memories and
exploration of her physical and emotional reactions to events.

	<em>Damon:<strong> Susceptible </strong></em><strong>by Geneviève
Castrée</strong><em><strong>.</strong> </em>A beautiful and delicately drawn
book by the artist/musician Castrée. I've waited a while for a longer work by
her and I wasn't disappointed, I was seduced.

	<em>Scott:</em> <strong><em>Sandman: Overture #1</em></strong> <strong>by
Neil Gaiman</strong>. I know this is a very recent arrival, but I'd been
anticipating it for some time and it lived up to the hype. This is Gaiman's
long awaited return to his epic Sandman series, and it's a prequel to the 75
issue storyline that won so many awards and became the academy's darling for
what comics "could be" if they were approached with seriousness and depth.
It's a bi-monthly series (already delayed for issue number two), so they're
taking their time with both the plot and the art. Gaiman's not out to
completely reinvent the wheel - his series was successful for a reason - but
he's adding layers to his previous stories by providing characterization that
makes me want to reread the full <em>Sandman</em> series again. The first
issue was astounding (even including a fold out double centerfold!), and I
highly recommend it to anyone who was a fan of the series the first go
around. Gaiman has not only lost none of his touch, he's a smarter and more
creative writer than he was two decades ago.

Matt Kindt (Dark Horse).</strong> Perhaps the most stunningly drawn and
coloured comic I have ever seen. Kindt puts everyone else to shame with his
one-man show. Honourable mention to <em>Grandville</em> by Bryan Talbot.

	<em>Dave: <strong>Parker s</strong></em><strong>eries by Darwyn Cooke
and</strong><strong> Jeff Lemire's</strong><strong>
</strong><em><strong>Essex County
</strong></em><strong>collection.</strong> Both represent great examples of
great stories meeting great art. I liked the drawing and the tone of that
drawing as much as the story lines.

	<em>Brenna: <strong>Fluffy </strong></em><strong>by Simone
Lea.</strong> I love that I learned about her at Comics Forum last year. I
maintain that Fluffy is basically the perfect comic.

	<em>Hattie: </em><strong>Michel Rabagliati's <em>Paul au
Parc</em>. </strong>I know that I do spend a lot of my time rambling on about
Rabagliati's work but he is honestly just superb. This, his most recent book,
tells the story of how Paul begins to overcome his natural shyness and joins
the Scouts. What follows is a touching story about life, friendship and
growing up. <em>Paul A Quebec</em> was undoubtedly Rabagliati's finest work
but this comes a close second in my mind.

	<em>Damon: </em><strong><em>Today Is the Last Day of the Rest of Your
Life</em> by Ulli Lust.</strong> I'm beginning to shy away from all these
breezeblock sized books that keep coming out, I like the emphemeral nature
imbedded in floppies and mini comics, but Lust's book drew me in to her
world. Or at least her punky teenage years hitchiking from Austria to Sicily.
Expressive two colour drawings and translated by the late Kim Thompson.

	<em>Scott</em>:  <strong><em>X-Men: Battle of the Atom</em></strong>
<strong>by Brian Michael Bendis</strong>. This one isn't really fair as it's
a full 10 issue arc, though I'm sure it will be collected in a trade soon (if
it hasn't been already) so I don't feel like I'm <em>really</em> cheating.
I'm showing my superhero colours here again, but the fallout from Avengers
vs. x-men in 2012 has created quite a shift in where the reader's sympathies
lie in terms of the racial equality that the x-men were founded on. Scott
Summers is now the leader of a splinter x-men group that is far more
subversive in its methods, with Wolverine now a teacher and running the Jean
Grey school for the "gifted." (i.e., mutants). The innovative reversal aside,
the writing is fabulous and the art, by various, is always superlative. The
<em>Battle of the Atom</em> crossover (bookended by two one shots) focuses on
the original, 1963-version, x-men traveling to their future / our present
ostensibly to comment on what has gone wrong with Xavier's idealistic vision
for a cooperative humankind. Their presence and commentary collapses the
history of the series and shows us not just how the x-men have changed, but
how the larger cultural milieu that the x-men was/is written for has changed
as well. As a metatext, it's mind-boggling nuanced and thought provoking.

	<em>Peter: <strong>Mind the Gap </strong></em><strong>by Jim McCann and
Rodin Esquejo (Image).</strong> Just not to my taste: glossy art, sensational
storytelling--everything I don't like about commercial comics.

	<em>Dave: <strong>Building</strong><strong>
Stories </strong></em><strong>by Chris Ware</strong><strong>.</strong> All
form no substance. While I admire Ware, he's getting a bit reliant on the
same schtick. I'd like to see some real innovation past Billy [Jimmy? -Ed.]
Corrigan, but everything seems to be a re-hash.

	<em>Brenna:</em> <strong><em>Paying For It</em> by Chester
Brown.</strong> Ugh, I like Chester Brown and I align with him on this issue
policitally but then he is just such a misogynist, myopic sleeze that I can't
even.

	<em>Hattie:</em> <em><strong>Saltire</strong></em><strong>.</strong> I
had high hopes for this first outing for this 'First National Superhero' for
Scotland. Unfortunately I was really rather disappointed by the character and
the story lines. Scottish comics could have done better in this instance.

	<em>Damon:</em> <em><strong>Marvelman/Miracleman.</strong></em> A friend
gave me a bunch of old comics including a complete run of <em>Warrior</em>
magazine and I realised that, despite the legendary status of the
<em>Marvelman</em> strip, superhero stories bore me to tears.

	<em>Scott</em>: <strong><em>Dexter</em></strong> <strong>by Jeff
Lindsay</strong>. Having followed the TV series and having read all seven
books that spawned it, when I heard that the original novel series' author
was going to be writing the comics version of Dexter I nearly had a fanboy
fit. The series was pushed back half a year from its original release date,
building up even more anticipation, but when it came out I couldn't have been
more disappointed. The plot was too easy and contrived, the art was
lackluster and rushed, and there were even spelling errors in some of the
dialogue. I still bought all five issues of the miniseries, but I was bored
to tears by the predictability of the plot and the droning nature of the
text. And they just announced a sequel miniseries! Booooo.

	<em>Peter: </em>The death of Kim Thompson at Fantagraphics. Successful
Kickstarter campaign for their spring season suggests that Fantagraphics will
carry on.

	<em>Dave: </em><a
href="http://www.avclub.com/article/is-ihawkeyeis-pizza-dog-issue-the-future-
of-superh-99538">Is Hawkeye’s Pizza Dog issue the future of superhero
comics?</a>  Finally someone who sees the convergence of great writing,
colouring, drawing with interesting storylines happening in a Superhero
comic. The everyday.

	<em>Brenna: </em>Archie Comics publishes first gay kiss.
[Underrepresentation of LGBT in mainstream comics generally.] THREE YEARS
after introducing the character and ONE YEAR after the gay wedding issue they
finally get around to it. God love 'em.

	<em>Hattie: </em>I'm struggling to think of something a fellow Graphixian
hasn't already mentioned (and I probably can't choose Damon and I joining
Graphixia**) so I am going to 'cheat' slightly here... I'm choosing one of my
most important comics studies headlines of this year and I think it is the
Comics Grid becoming a journal. If you have followed our recent posts about
our trips to Leeds and London you'll have heard us talk a lot about how
important the Comics Grid has been to us all personally and in terms of our
academic approach. This development in the Grid's status this year gets me
pretty darn excited about the potential and future of comics scholarship.

	<em>Damon: </em>Kim Thompson RIP. Publisher, editor and long-time
champion and translator of European and non English language comics. Thank
you for Ulli Lust, Jacques Tardi and Jason among many others.

	<em>Scott</em>: The biggies (of the serious stuff) I think have been
covered above, so I'm going to go peripherally related here and say that, for
the comic shop community at least, the announcement of Ben Affleck as the new
Batman took the prize. Total mixed feelings on that one, but then hey, I
thought Ledger was going to make a terrible Joker.

	<strong>Biggest WTF Comics Moment of 2013:</strong>

	<em>Peter: </em>Shia LaBoeuf's plagiarism of Daniel Clowes' Justin M
Damiano for his short film <a
href="HowardCantour.com">HowardCantour.com</a>. And his plagiarism of
everyone else, including <a href="http://www.tcj.com/goodnight/">Dan Nadel at
Picture Box</a>.

	<em>Dave: </em>Visiting the Art Spiegelman <em>CO-MIX: A Retrospective of
Comics, Graphics and Scraps</em> exhibit at the Vancouver Art Gallery /
Everyone's undying love of Linda Barry. Underwhelming hodge-podge of stuff.
Something makes me nervous about putting comics in an art gallery.
Self-gratifying, self-selected, and self-promoting. A little too dirty for
me.

	<em>Brenna:</em> Definitely Damon sending me the <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> /
Sarah Palin crossover comic, which I will talk about in more detail over at
Book Riot soon. Could not be a weirder use of letters and ink.

	<em>Hattie:</em> Shia LaBoeuf vs Daniel Clowes. I have probably done my
WTF face at other comics events this year but this is one where I don't even
know where to begin.

	<em>Damon:</em> Setting up the <em>Sequential Investigations: The New
Comics</em> exhibition at Graphixia's Comics &amp; the Multimodal World
conference and being stopped by security. They were disturbed by Warren
Craghead's 'seed toss' post-it artworks, which occasionally depicted guns and
knives. I think they were worried about a student going postal or thought it
was a cry for help.

	<em>Scott</em>: The Shia LaBoeuf thing, though it's been said twice
above. Comics don't really make news anymore, sadly. This was disappointing
though, from a collector's dream perspective: A man who was remodeling a
house he'd bought for $10K <a title="found a copy of Action Comics #1 used as
insulation in the wall."
href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/23/action-comics-1-copy-found-
inside-mans-house_n_3324544.htm">found a copy of Action Comics #1 used as
insulation in the wall</a>. There was some kind of kefuffle and in the heat
of the moment his aunt TORE OFF THE WHOLE BACK COVER. Enough to reduce a nerd
to tears, since there are only supposedly something like 100 copies left in
existence. Definitely WTF.

	<em>Peter: </em>Interviewing Paul Gravett at Comics Forum 2013 in
Leeds. He signed my copy of <em>Comics Art</em> "from one comics activist to
another."

	<em>Dave: </em>Reading<em> Hawkeye </em>#11. Just such a great comic and
such a great story run.

	<em>Brenna: </em>The Spiegleman exhibit at VAG. Not that I liked
everything about it, but it gave me the most to ponder in my understanding of
comics and the academy / canon (and why I'm starting to agree with Dave that
we don't need no stinkin' canon).

	<em>Hattie:</em> Meeting Michel Rabagliati. Earlier this year I was lucky
enought to interview Michel Rabagliati for my PhD. He was every bit as kind,
gentle and interesting as you would expect and was very generous with his
time, thoughts and <em>Paul</em> merchandise.

	<em>Damon: </em>Being tweeted that 'the man at the crossroads' Paul
Gravett was talking about my comic at the Graphic Medicine conference in
Brighton in August. During a DeeCAP performance at a conference in Dundee I
performed a strip from <em>The Adventures of Ticking Boy</em> and later gave
PG a copy of the comic. He then included it in a rundown of 'graphic
medicine' comics while presenting in Brighton.

	<em>Scott</em>: I got to meet Stan Lee, up close and personal, at Fan
Expo in Vancouver this Summer. At 90 years old, he seemed remarkably robust -
cracking quick-witted jokes, hitting on girls in his audience and posing for
<a title="a huge group shot"
href="http://www.comicsblend.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Stan-Lee-
Fancouver.jpg">a huge group shot</a> with over 100 cosplayers.  'Nuff said. I
also got to sit in and have my picture taken in the DeLorean from Back to the
Future. I know that's not comic booky, but I wanted to make sure that fact is
out there. Yes, <em>that</em> DeLorean. Yes, <em>me</em>.

	<em>Peter: More Bad Machinery </em>from John Allison. Sophie and I can't
get enough of this awesome comic.

	<em>Dave: </em>Jason Lutes' <em>Berlin: City of Lights</em>. I'm dying to
see this tome wrapped up before I die. It's been a long time for Lutes since
City of Smoke / Stones and I'm wanting some more!

	<em>Brenna: </em>BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY IS DROPPING <em>SECONDS</em> IN THE
SUMMER. OMG CAN'T WAIT. I heart you, Bryan Lee O'Malley.

	<em>Hattie:</em> I haven't got a clue… BUT I did put Joe Sacco's <em>The
Great War</em> on my Christmas list and so I would say that it is my most
anticipated comics reading of 2014 (at the moment!).

	<em>Damon: </em>No idea! Surprise me. Keeping my eye on self-publishers
&amp; small press though. Oily, Retrofit, kuš! and the work of Sam Alden
&amp; Warren Craghead, Robert Kirby's <em>QU33R</em> anthology looks
interesting too.

	<em>Scott</em>: I really haven't been following the announcements like I
should for the big summer events. That said, I'm really looking forward to
the final issue of <a title="Robert Kirkman's All Out War 12 issue arc"
href="http://walkingdead.wikia.com/wiki/Volume_20:_All_Out_War_-_Part_One">
Robert Kirkman's <em>All Out War</em> 12 issue arc</a> in the <em>Walking
Dead</em>, and I'm biting my nails waiting to see what Gaiman's going to be
offering next in <em>Sandman: Overture</em>. Man, am I glad he's back on that
stuff. I'm with Dave too on the third volume of Berlin (which I had no idea
was coming out until he mentioned it above), as I just finished <em>City of
Smoke</em> and it was just as amazing as <em>City of Stones</em>, if not
moreso.

<link>http://www.graphixia.ca/2013/12/148-morrison-and-quitely-and-perfect-
partnerships/</link> <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2013 17:00:14 +0000</pubDate>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Our theme of
collaboration this round got me thinking about collaborative partnerships in
comics, which immediately took me to my favourite pairing: Grant Morrison and
Frank Quitely. Morrison and Quitely are both skilled in their own rights as
writer and artist, respectively; they each collaborate with many other comics
folk and do good work in other venues. But something about their work
sparkles when they work together, and I would argue the best of each man's
career has been under the Morrison-Quitely banner. Whether their original,
complex, and harrowing character work in <i>We3</i> or their fresh take on
old superhero standbys in <em>JLA: Earth 2</em> and <em>All-Star
Superman</em>, the work they've done together has consistently challenged and
surprised audiences. In the world of comics, quite simply, I think of them as
a Perfect Partnership. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/GMTWGforWired4.jpg">
<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3396" alt="GMTWGforWired4"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/GMTWGforWired4.jpg"
width="462" height="260" /></a></p> As Marc Singer pointed out in
his <em>Grant Morrison</em>, the relationship between Morrison and Quitely is
different from with any of his collaborators; where other artists do not
communicate directly with Morrison but instead are routed through the series
editor or his wife, Quitely and Morrison frequently work together in their
hometown of Glasgow. The difference in their relationship seems to lend a
closeness has allowed for some of the most experimental work in each of their
careers, particularly the stunning <em>We3</em>, which forwarded a style
Morrison called "Western Manga" and attempted to represent three-dimensional
action on the pages of a comic in a new and more dynamic way.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/we321213.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3395" alt="we321213"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/we321213.jpg"
width="600" height="332" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	Morrison's work with Quitely differs from his more carefully framed and
professionally distant collaborative relationships, to, in that in
Morrison-Quitely pairings, the visual is allowed to supersede the script and
take centre stage. Morrison's other titles tend to be story-heavy and
pay-off-light, <a
href="http://www.tcj.com/flex-mentallo-and-the-morrison-problem/">as Sean
Rogers argues to good (and sometimes overdone) effect in his <em>Comics
Journal</em> review of another collaborative effort, <em>Flex
Mentallo</em></a>: <blockquote>Surely the strongest sequences in the
Morrison/Quitely canon are those where Morrison writes the least: the potted
origin story that leads off their <em>Superman</em>, the silent psychodrama
that takes up an entire issue of <em>New X-Men</em>, the video screens and
savage attacks of <em>We3</em>.</blockquote> I disagree with Rogers about the
vapidity of Morrison's writing, but I do agree that Morrison-Quitely comics
are most alive in the most highly visual sequences, and more importantly that
Morrison's work is more alive when it is Quitely who realizes his scripts.
Part of this is as simple as Quitely's brilliance. <a
href="http://www.comicbookgrrrl.com/2012/07/05/glasgow-comic-con-grant-
morrison-and-frank-quitely-in-conversation/">As Morrison said at Glasgow
Comic Con</a>: <blockquote>We worked all this stuff out for the deep symbol
structure of it and built this up and I’m really excited by this, it's all
grids, it's like a mathematical puzzle and time is represented in many
different ways, so it's really kinda exciting. And again, it's something only
the two of us could have done together, no one else would be able to do this
stuff that I've asked Frank to do.</blockquote> But it's also worth knowing
that <em>We3</em>, certainly the finest work the pair have ever done, is also
the work the two have done most free from the constraints of the Big 2 and
their intellectual property. And perhaps that's where collaboration works
best: closeness, comparable strengths, and the creative freedom to explore
new pathways.

	All I know is, I'll read anything they make.]]></content:encoded>

over at <a
href="http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/cluster/multimodality-

participating in a cluster about comics and the everyday.

	Here's the intro to the cluster, curated by Ernesto Priego and me, David
N. Wright.

	We are pleased to be able to contribute to The New Everyday by curating
this cluster collecting short articles that focus on how comics infiltrate
cultural representations or situations that fall outside extensions of the
page.

	While comic books have certainly transgressed the page by moving onto
digital platforms and other forms of communication media, they have also
embedded themselves in our sense of history, the design of our digital
interfaces, academic conversations, urban spaces, cultural discourses, and
representations of personal hygiene.

	Nevertheless, current comics scholarship seems adamant to take paradigms
of print for granted, leaving other manifestations of comics iconography and
“language” largely unexplored. We’re moving comics off the page, both by
publishing a digital collection and by addressing the extensions of comics
that do not necessarily link back to Gutenberg’s machine.

	As an international, multidisciplinary, collaborative online project,
featuring a diverse range of scholarly timbre, this cluster is an experiment
in online comics scholarship that offers a different kind of output than what
might normally be expected from journal articles. If comics are to move off
the page, then this cluster actively resists such associations as it strives
for a kind of liminal, fragmentary scholarship that suggests offerings in
search of responses.

	Architecture, design, sex, web browsers, current politics, celebrity
magazines, fandom, cities and advertising: the articles in this cluster
explore just a few examples of comics not as a fixed paradigm, but as
multimodality itself.

	The articles here are not definitive answers to a set of questions; they
are the beginnings of a conversation, reflections occurring in a newly framed
space, and instigations for open resistance, dissent, optimism, and exchange.

	From the outset, we undertook the creation of this cluster as a rapid
online publication project, and as such we did not impose editorial
guidelines apart from requesting brief contributions that addressed its
thematic scope.

	"Rapid", however, is relative: the seed was planted during the Comics and
the Multimodal World conference in Vancouver in June 2013, and work for this
cluster started in early September 2013. Moreover, writing and editing for
different online content management systems is a skill set on its own that
requires and imposes its own working behavior and timeframe, which usually
account for very long working hours during extended periods.

	On the one hand there tends to be a bombastic rhetoric of the 'simple',
'immediate' and 'intuitive' nature of online technologies; on the other hand
the are the negative, snobbish academic prejudices against blogging and other
forms of online publishing as legitimate, citeable academic outputs. In
reality, digital labour remains intensive, complex and specialised, requiring
not only appropriate expertise but also heaps of patience, willingness to
collaborate and understanding of the technical idiosyncracies of specific
platforms.

	Authors composed their contributions for the MediaCommons platform, and
therefore worked directly on its content management system, facing different
challenges that up to a certain extent also determined what kind of
contribution was and was not possible.

	To this end, the cluster reflects the limitations of taking comics off
the page at the same time as it seeks to position the critical dialogue about
comics outside prescribed, or established, limitations.

	Ultimately, the cluster hopes to help position comics and the scholarship
about comics within a 21st century academic dialogue, pushing the subject
toward new situations, contexts, and definitions.

	If nothing else, we wanted a digital cluster about comics to instigate
conversations and arguments about not only the practice of comics
scholarship, but the representative spaces in which those conversations and
arguments might take place.

	Like other clusters within MediaCommons, this cluster is meant to reflect
digital scholarship in practice, or scholarship created with digital means
meant to be read and cited with digital means.

	This cluster about the multimodality of comics in everyday life is in
itself an expression of the everyday constraints and opportunities posed by
academic worklife in the 21st century.

	Rock on you crazy diamonds,

	Ernesto Priego David N. Wright

		<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Comics are, on
		the surface, the most consistently collaborative form of literature –
		it hardly needs to be said that comics are most frequently the result
		of a production team that includes the writer, the artist, the
		colourist and the letterer, among others. In effect, though we’re
		presented with a singular work, much as occurs in film we are blinded
		to the fact that we are actually seeing multiple artists practicing
		their chosen crafts, each attempting to emphasize his or her own
		particular talent. We tend to emphasize this collaborative aspects of
		comics, often simply out of habit or fear of privileging the writer –
		after all, it’s more difficult to quote a picture in order to show
		how an artist, colourist or letterer has reinterpreted the original
		vision in order to come up with something radically different from
		the unique ambitions of the text, and doing so arguably requires more
		subjective interpretation. The bulk of the literature notes, almost
		dismissively, that comics are collaborative and offers very little in
		terms of exploring any hierarchy that might exist, primarily to
		tacitly declare that comics are, in a word, different from other
		print media.

	In the actual scripts for comics, however, writers often assert their
textual authority in order to limit the ambiguities that the others involved
in the work can take advantage of – Alan Moore is notorious for this, writing
essentially in stream of consciousness, describing nearly every detail of
even the smallest panel in order to ensure that his vision reaches the page.
This said, there is no set formula as to how an author must interact with the
team producing the comic, despite suggested templates for script writing from
the major publishers (want to submit a comics script to Image, for example?
<a title="It's easier than you might think"
href="https://www.imagecomics.com/about/submissions" target="_blank">It’s
easier than you might think</a>). An interesting comparison of scripts from
different mainstream comics writers has been coming together at the comic
book scripts archive (<a
title="http://www.comicbookscriptarchive.com/archive/the-scripts/"
href="http://www.comicbookscriptarchive.com/archive/the-scripts/"
target="_blank">http://www.comicbookscriptarchive.com/archive/the-scripts/</a
>), where we can understand the interplay – or perhaps struggle - between
writer, artist and letterer in a more nuanced way. The interaction, starting
with the writer as the locus and then extending outward to the other players,
is far more intricate than it at first appears.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/gaiman.jpg"><img
class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3415" alt="gaiman"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/gaiman-225x300.jpg"
width="225" height="300" /></a>Neil Gaiman is a strong case in point here
(and I admit that I may be concentrating on him a lot lately because of the
superb start to his new Sandman: Overture series and the fact that it seems
like <a title="a Sandman movie is finally in the works"
href="http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=113416"
target="_blank">a Sandman movie series is finally in the works</a>). Looking
at <a title="the posted script for Sandman #24"
href="http://www.comicbookscriptarchive.com/goods/neilgaiman/Sandman24.doc"
target="_blank">the posted script for Sandman #24</a>,  we see a similar
stream of consciousness writing style as Moore employs, however there appears
to be a trust and freedom given to those who he is working with to produce
the issue. Referring to his artists by name, the script reads more like a
conversation between peers, with open avenues for suggestion and a reliance
on the skills of others to fill in areas where Gaiman knows that his artists
have greater expertise than himself in creating innovative images. This said,
because the Sandman is couched in mythology, he also provides sketches for
the artists to follow to ensure that his vision is being followed accurately.
This is, after all, Gaiman’s story, and as the script progresses we see the
lengths that he goes to in order to tighten control over his subjects despite
his friendly and open demeanor in his descriptions of the scenes.

	Gaiman directly addresses all those he knows will be involved in the
production of the text from the outset, from the primary artist to the
letterer, and he gives directions for each as he presents his vision of the
issue. Throughout the script he describes in perfect detail how he would like
word balloons to appear, how ornately costuming is meant to be drawn, which
research material and from what period the artist should consult in order to
accurately depict particular characters as he has written them – even those
secondary characters who will only appear for a few panels at a time. It is
the writer’s task to know the qualities of the artists who will be working
for him (and, as the scripts show, this is indeed the dynamic) and while
playing to them at times it also becomes necessary to restrain or subvert
them. Quite telling is the final panel of Sandman #24, in which Gaiman
provides highly detailed instructions for the small frame to his artist Kelly
Jones:

	“Okay. Now close in on this mister cool Sandman. Kelley. Don't define his
face with shadows on this final page define it with fine lines, as fine and
sparse as you can. He's cool as Hell, and almost-smiling, totally
mirthlessly.”

	Jones, known for his use of blacks and dark shadowing, is interrupted
here at Gaiman’s behest – Gaiman is aware of Jones’ style and openly
contrasts this with a description of the technique that Jones is meant to
use. Comparing this panel from one of the others from the same issue, in
which Jones employs the shadowing he is more known for, we see this:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sanddark.jpg"><img
class="size-medium wp-image-3411 alignleft" alt="sanddark"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sanddark-224x300.jpg"
width="238" height="320" /></a> <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sandlight.jpg"><img
class="size-medium wp-image-3412 alignright" alt="sandlight"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sandlight-220x300.jpg
" width="231" height="316" /></a>

	The comparison is striking, and it makes one realize how much creative
control the writer actually wields over the display of the story. From panel
arrangement, to shadowing, to particular technique in terms of shading or
lettering, all aspects of the image are scrupulously described. Moreover,
when presented with large splash panels and pages that contain little to no
dialogue, we often think that because of the absence of text, the author has
less to do with these interludes. When looking at the actual scripts,
however, we can see that quite frequently the opposite is true: there is
often what appears to be a nervousness that comes out in the form of lengthy
description that the artist is required to follow, more detailed and
embellished than for the frames in which text is directed to appear. Whether
this is predicated on an anxiety related to control or simply a desire to
ensure that the story as the writer sees it is portrayed accurately is
debatable; however, it becomes clear that the writer controls far more of the
process than he or she is often given credit for in works that are more
frequently deemed collaborative.

	There is of course variation between writers in the amount of control
that they assert over their comics, ranging from Miller, who draws most of
his own scripts, to an author like Jason Aaron, who allows far more creative
control. What is interesting however is that those comics that have been
picked up by the academy are primarily those that are more writer-centric, in
which the scripts are so detailed as to allow little room for maneuvering on
the part of the rest of the ensemble cast; again Gaiman, Moore and Ellis
among others being at the centre of the current canon. I don’t mean to assert
that the artist’s (or letterer, or colourist) task is any less significant
when it comes to producing a comic, and the overall product we read is
clearly a combination of multiple talents – there remain annual awards to
acknowledge the contributions of best penciller, inker and letterer to attest
to their skills. It is, however, important that we note that the comics
process is far less collaborative than it at first appears, and perhaps it is
our desire as society as a whole to pursue equality on all fronts that causes
us to gloss the creative hegemony that is often enforced by the
writer.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

(“You can’t top the taste of a Twirl”) my absolute favourite dirty* chocolate
snack is a bag of Revels. For those of you unfamiliar with Revels they are a
chocolate coated sweet with a possibility of five different centres. Revels
offer me just enough tastebud excitement without verging on the kerrr-azy
territory of bacon chocolate and even if I get my least favourite Malteaser
one I know that the next one is possibly going to be a coffee one (best revel
of all). Revels really do have it all.

	&nbsp;

	Worry not, dear reader, they have not secretly changed Graphixia to
become a confectionary blog, rather I am trying in my own clumsy way to
describe what it is that is just so lovely about <em>Nelson</em>, the subject
of this post here today. <em>Nelson</em> is a so-called “collective graphic
novel” published in 2011, edited by Rob Davis and Woodrow Phoenix and the
fruits of a collaboration between 54 (yes, you did read that correctly)
artists. In brief <em>Nelson</em> tells the story of one Nel, born in London
in 1968, Nel’s parents thought she was going to be a boy and so were going to
call him Nelson, instead they had twins, Nel and Sonny, though Sonny died
very soon after his birth. The spectre of her twin brother haunts Nel
throughout the book and the responsibility of living for the both of them
weighs heavily upon her. The story is told via a series of 54 snapshots set
in the years between 1968 and 2011. Each section is by a different artist and
the range of styles, colours and tones across the whole book is breathtaking.
It was the first publication from the UKCC, United Kingdom Comics Collective,
but I really hope for lots more.

	&nbsp;

	I love the idea of anthologies and the prospect of reading work by
new-to-me creators, however when I find one that I love or a story I am
engrossed in I find myself getting frustrated by the end of that contribution
by the fact that it is over so soon.  I was therefore unsure about
<em>Nelson</em> but swayed enough by the gallons of praise being poured upon
it on Twitter to give it a try. And surprise, surprise I loved it. Nel is an
engaging heroine right from the very start and it is a delight to see her
character developing and being fleshed out as different artists get their
hands on her. The overarching storyline of Nel’s life, loves and various
careers is handled deftly with enough continuity to ensure that the story
continues to flow throughout. However it isn’t just Nel that stands out as a
great character, the people that surround her, her emotionally damaged
parents, her oh-so perfect sister and her best friend Tabitha are all given
the space and time to become integral parts of Nel’s history. Given the sheer
logistical difficulties involved in coordinating 54 different artists to tell
one story I find the way in which secondary characters are handled
particularly effective.

	[caption id="attachment_3423" align="aligncenter" width="217"]<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Nelson-McNaught.jpg"

217x300.jpg" width="217" height="300" /></a> Jon McNaught - 1993[/caption]

	The impact of each artist being given a distinct time period in Nel’s
life is two fold, the change in tone created by the differences in style
between the enormous number of artists gives each section a truly distinct
feeling that underlines the enormous changes that Nel’s undergoes throughout
her life. The amount of attention that must have gone into deciding upon the
order in which the artists would appear in the book and which sections of
Nel’s life they would each approach must have been enormous and you can tell
the care and attention that was put into decisions like this. For example the
transition between Warren Pleece’s contribution for 1988 with its bright
colours and strong lines to the gentle, muted and regimented work of Kristina
Baczynski for 1989 perfectly reflects the changes happening in Nel’s life at
this point. In 1988 she is an art student in Manchester and in control of
almost every aspect of her own life however by the time we see her again in
1989 she has left Art School and has returned to living with her mum.
Pleece’s work breaks free of its frames and ably reflects Nel’s own desire to
break down the structures that she feels so constrained by. However by the
time she is returning home to live with her mum, her life is being forced
back to fit into one room again and so Baczkynski’s neat and even drawings
with its regular use of very small frames perfectly reflects the way in which
Nel’s life and personality is being constrained by these changes.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Similarly after Nel’s father’s death as she struggles with work, life and
her mental health, the style of the artwork is distinctly more muted in tone,
as Nel struggles to maintain control of her students, her drinking and her
life, she finally reaches a crisis point in 2002 and Duncan Fegredo’s use of
simple blue and sepia tones to depict this pivotal moment fits perfectly.
Philippa Rice’s naïve and childlike figures follow this section and again
this underlines the way in which Nel is rebuilding her life from the ground
up following her breakdown.

	&nbsp;

	‘Nelson’ doesn’t just work as a novel or gimmicky way in which to
demonstrate the range and scope of comics artistry on offer in the United
Kingdom today. I did, of course, thoroughly enjoy the opportunity to see the
work of new-to-me artists that I have since read more of. However to my mind
the really awesome thing about ‘Nelson’ is just she sheer scope and
achievement of this collaboration and how it was the perfect way to tell this
story. Normally when we discuss collaboration in comics we’re talking about
collaborations between a handful of creators, usually each taking
responsibility for a distinct area of the comics’ production. Nelson offers a
different model of comics collaboration that tells a simple story in a novel
and exciting way. Without wanting an inundation of cheap imitations I would
love to see another story told in this way, few stories and characters over
recent years have touched me as much as Nel and her life's tale.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	*I use dirty here in the sense that it is not the artisan produced,
beautifully bitter, herb scented chocolate that I am probably meant to claim
I love above all things.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[For this week’s post
I’d like to give a little insight into a collaboration process that I have
gone through recently. My first comics collaboration happened when I was
about 8 years old. A pal and I created a strip that was a rip-off of <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2MT2EJbWEY" target="_blank">Danger
Mouse</a>. We didn’t do anything with it, I don’t think we even finished it.
It was just a way to pass some time doing something we both enjoyed.

	It was 30 years before I collaborated on another comic, while I was
studying for my MA illustration. One of the <a
href="http://blog.eca.ac.uk/garlicsapphires/" target="_blank">projects</a>
involved teaming up with a writer from Edinburgh University’s creative
writing MA. We were paired at random but ‘my’ writer, <a
href="http://non-the-road.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">Chris
Lindores</a>, was also into comics. We decided that I would illustrate an
existing poem of Chris’s and we met a few times to discuss the <a
href="http://www.damonherd.com/comics%20window.html"
target="_blank">adaptation</a>. Although the poem was based on real events -
my love of autobiographical comics showing through! - there was a shared
liking for Batman so that somehow crept in. Looking back the strip is OK, if
a little literal, too much show AND tell going on.

Damon Herd[/caption]

	At the end of last year another opportunity for collaboration came up
when my friend, the cartoonist <a href="http://fredeggcomics.blogspot.co.uk/"
target="_blank">David Robertson</a>, asked me if I would like to contribute a
one page strip to the next issue of his comic <em><a
href="http://fredeggcomics.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/dump-number-2.html"
target="_blank">Dump</a></em>. Much like myself, David is quite content to be
producing his own comics purely for the sake of making comics. This isn’t a
get rich quick scheme or the first step in a career in the movies, this is
making comics for the love of comics. With a day job and family to occupy
most of his time David manages to produce strips whenever he gets a spare
moment, and gradually the stories build up until he has enough material to
publish a book. His comics are refreshingly uncynical and have a wry sense of
humour. Whenever I host a <a
href="http://comicsforum.org/2013/08/21/comics-and-performance-from-chalk-
talks-to-carousel-by-damon-herd/" target="_blank">DeeCAP</a> comics
performance event in Dundee I always ask David to contribute, as this humour
comes through in his deadpan delivery, and he knows how to work an audience.

jpg" width="300" height="421" /></a> Cover of Dump issue 2 by David
Robertson[/caption]

	<em>Dump</em> serialises David’s ongoing strip Dump, which details the
adventures of Bert, the main character from David’s webcomic, <em><a
href="http://www.webcomicsnation.com/fredeggcomics/berserkotron/series.php?
view=archive&amp;chapter=40955" target="_blank">Berserkotron</a></em>, who
now works at the local rubbish tip. The book also acts as a repository (or
dump) for David’s other strips, including <em>One Day at Space Wizard
Central</em> (a highlight at a previous DeeCAP) and <em>History of E-mail and
the Internet</em>. For the latest issue he decided to collaborate with
artists Neil Paterson, <a href="http://kearabazstewart.tumblr.com/"
target="_blank">Keara Stewart</a>, <a
href="http://donnahartartwork.daportfolio.com/" target="_blank">Donna
Law</a>, and <a href="http://thequietestpage.bandcamp.com/"
target="_blank">Stephen Boyd</a>, as well as myself, on five one page strips.
David wrote the scripts and we produced the art, apart from Stephen’s strip,
where David wrote the story to fit existing artwork.

	David actually gave the artists a choice on whether they wanted to write
and draw their own strips but everyone decided to illustrate David’s scripts.
Typical of us lazy artists! But we should be careful what we wish for. When
the script arrived it wasn’t what I was expecting. I thought it would be all
text, dialogue with descriptions of the scenes, but what turned up was a
fully sketched out page with thumbnailed panel layouts and dialogue. I joked
that David was ‘no Stan Lee’ because he had supplied such detailed scripts,
no Marvel method here! At first I didn’t think this left much room for
collaboration, David had asserted what <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/01/13/150-asserting-authorial-
authority-how-collaborative-are-comics-really/" target="_blank">Scott</a>
called his ‘textual authority’ but as I read through the script I realised
that there were certain things I could bring to the page.

	David’s script was set out on a strict 12-panel grid and I felt that the
flow of the page could be improved slightly. I wanted to contain on one row
the sequence of three panels that occurs in one character’s head. This meant
rejigging the other panels on the page, I had to expand the previous two
panels to fill a row and lose a panel on the final tier. This seemed to work
as I could still put all the remaining dialogue in the final three panels, or
so I thought (more on that in a moment). So, while the underlying grid was
still 12 panels, I had managed to tell the same story in 11 panels. As the
scene was basically two people talking in an office I used <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Wood" target="_blank">Wally
Wood</a>’s <a
href="http://momentofcerebus.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/wally-woods-22-panels-
that-always-work.html" target="_blank">22 Panels That Always Work</a>, to
help with a few panels (you might notice the ones I swiped).

	I sent David a rough sketch of my layout and he remarked that he liked
the two panel ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok_42shL_5E"
target="_blank">Smith and Jones</a>’ row but was worried that I wasn’t using
all the dialogue. I assured him that I would but had only scribbled a few
lines on the layout sketch for speed. Turns out he was right to worry. I sent
him the finished scan just before Christmas (I think he was tapping his feet
waiting on me so he could send the finished book to the printers). A copy of
the freshly printed comic dropped through my letterbox soon after the New
Year and I was very pleased to see how it turned out.

	I met up with David last week and we discussed how the process had gone.
He had been really pleased with how each cartoonist had approached his
scripts, a couple of us had moved a few panels around but the strips still
presented David’s stories. Then he pointed out something missing from my
finished strip - half the dialogue in the final three panels! Apparently the
scan he sent me was incomplete so I never received the text, however the
strip still made sense so I never noticed. David had wondered if he should
ask me to redo the strip, but agreed that it still made sense even if it
wasn’t exactly what he had intended. Also, the repositioning that I did to
his panels would not have worked as well if I had tried to squeeze in the
missing dialogue.

	I think that is the joy of a collaboration, things don’t quite turn out
the way you planned them. Another person’s interpretation of the same problem
will likely generate different results from your own, and hopefully the input
from two people creates something that neither of you would have produced on
your own. It is like the ‘mathematics’ of comics, words + images = something
much more than just a simple combination of the two.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:
left;">The smooth surfaces of our modern-day computers and mobile devices
(phones, tablets, e-readers) can often hide the complex history of their
making.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">Whereas it can be argued that the
"digital age" has democratised up to a certain extent a "culture of making"
by encouraging people to create and share open-source code, the software and
hardware of today can simultaneously alienate users from an awareness of the
material conditions of production that still underpin creative labour. This
is related to a tendency to think that these current devices are making
"collaboration" possible in a way that did not exist before. A look back at
the history of comic books as cultural products implies a look at how these
publications were <em>made</em>.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">Before the
use of digital computers in the production of mainstream comic books became
widespread in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a convoluted assembly-line
process was standarised. It often involved a range of agents, and I'd like to
argue that this process helped to define the expressive boundaries and
possibilities of the medium and the specific texts it produced. The available
tools defined specific roles, and this specific roles were located at
more-or-less fixed steps or positions within the process. These steps also
played a role in defining an authorial/creative hierarchy, and ultimately in
defining the identity of different comic book authors within the industry and
within the produced textualities as well. Hence, for example, the penciller
used pencils; the inker, inks. Other roles within the process were not
specific tool-dependent, but implied a variety of other tools that implicitly
imposed particular modes of behaviour and expression.</p> <p
style="text-align: left;">The participants in the production chain used their
own respective “tools of the trade”, and the levels of authorial involvement
varied greatly from one participant to another. With this method of
production, the editor and publisher remained the all-seeing eye in the
process; they were the agents with the clearest conceptual vision of what the
finished product would look like (for a fascinating visual itinerary of the
changes in the textual topology of a comic book in progress, see Gibbons,
<i>Watching the Watchmen, </i>2008; also useful is the now-classic Lee and
Buscema,  1977. For academic engagements, see McAllister et al 2002; Gibbons
2008).</p> The process could be as diverse as there were comics authors, and
many did not follow identical steps. Nevertheless it is possible to infer a
general work flow,  a standard industrial process that mainstream publishers
used to impose as a production line:

diagram describes the convoluted process of multi-authored mainstream
American comic books. It imposed constraints of all types, and forced those

	&nbsp;

	Conceptualised as such, the process could start either with the writer,
the editor and publisher or the artists (usually the penciller). It can be
assumed that often the writer first produced a typewritten script that was
sent to the editor for approval, who in turn may have had it sent back to the
writer for revisions. The penciller produced a basic layout for the story,
not dissimilar to a movie storyboard, either before or after receiving the
typewritten script via the editor. The process continued through the inker
who went over the penciller's traces, then the colourist who illuminated the
previously inked illustrations using several manual or mechanical techniques;
then the letterer, who calligraphically or mechanically added the written
words to the page.

	By then the editor would already have commissioned a cover from different
artist(s) (who may have followed the same process as the inside pages'
artists), and everything was put together as a coherent textual whole by a
graphic and editorial designing team. The whole package was sent back to the
editor and proofreaders, and if no further corrections were deemed necessary
then the whole mechanic or pre-press original was sent to the printer. Though
it is not depicted in the diagram, proof copies were sometimes sent back to
the editor for approval, since colour separation techniques, paper and ink
quality, etc., also affected the finished publication. The printer would in
turn deliver it to the distributors in charge of selling the books to the
readers through their established channels.

	The heritage of 18<sup>th</sup> century caricature and 19<sup>th</sup>
century illustrated journals is historically embedded in this industrial
system that juxtaposes artistic creation with mechanical reproduction. The
techniques used to create the illustrations and often the texts themselves
were varied, from wood engraving (1770s) and lithography (1798) to the relief
halftone (1852). These methods confounded creation and reproduction, and
became popular because they increased the speed with which publications were
produced and lowered the cost and broadened the audience for these
illustrated materials. This created an explosion in the illustrated
publications industry in the United States and Europe between 1850 and 1890,
and set the industrial conditions for serialised production that would define
mainstream comic book publishing a century later.

	The influence of technological development in the history of the artistic
evolution of the comic book in the late 1930s and the early 1940s is no
different, but the differences between comic strips published in daily or
weekly newspapers and the production of longer narratives in monthly or
bi-weekly stand-alone flexible spine publications imposed a different set of
possibilities and constraints. Until the 1950s, even though comic strips were
often created with the help of assistants, the work was credited to a single
author. Whilst comic strips authors largely worked alone or from home,
collaborating with others often through the post, the studios where animation
films were made were not unlike medieval scriptoria, where authorial work was
carried out collectively and the <i>auctor</i>/scribes/artists worked
together on individual desks. These working spaces were proper artwork
factories. and the influence they must have had on the superhero comics of
the late 1940s and 1950s cannot be underestimated.

left;" align="center">Kimmelman (1996) offers a discussion of the concept
of <em>auctor</em> that could well be applied to understand the role of comic
book authors during the Golden and Silver Ages of American comic books. The
common traits between the production lines in factories and comics and
animation studies also underscore the material conditions of production of
comic books and animated films and shows. British graffiti artist Banksy
directed an episode of the American animation series <i>The Simpsons</i>,
aired on 10 October 2010. In<a

href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX1iplQQJTo" target="_blank"> the
introduction to the show</a>, the viewer sees an East Asian factory where
rows of workers in terrible conditions hand-colour frames of the cartoon, a
clear critique of the industrial conditions of production involved in
mainstream animation</p> <p style="text-align: left;" align="center">It must
also be said that the visual representation and self-representation of comic
book artists through photographs, drawings and paintings of the artists
sitting at their desks and surrounded by their tools deserves closer study
(see Priego <a title="The Digital Scriptoria: Textuality and Materiality "
href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/opticon1826/archive/issue9/imagegallery/
Image_Priego.pdf" target="_blank">2010</a>).  In October 2010, the National
Portrait Gallery in Washington DC was formally presented with a 1986<a

ObjectID/,/is/,/111870/,/false/,/false&amp;newprofile=CAP&amp;newstyle=single
" target="_blank"> photograph by Yousuf Karsh</a> of cartoonist Charles M.
Schulz sitting at his desk with a <i>Peanuts</i> strip in progress next to a
collection of pens. The Smithsonian Institution has traditionally been very
welcoming of comic art, but this is a significant event since it is the first
portrait of a cartoonist to make it to the walls of the American National
Portrait Gallery.</p> The comic strip artist who published his work on daily
or weekly newspapers was known for his manual skill and speed with which he
could both write and draw. For reproduction purposes nothing more than a
photostat in black and white of the original strip was required (composed of
black ink on white paper). Sunday colour supplements required a more
complicated procedure, involving colour separations made without the strip
artist's control (Gordon 1988).

	In the late 1950s and early 1960's the conditions under which the modern
comic book was produced differed for several reasons.  The division of labour
as exemplified in the diagram above was essentially a corporate attempt at
protecting the publishing companies' intellectual property (by taking
advantage of the creators' work, who rightfully claimed authorship of the
published material). According to Dowd, the division of labour in comic book
production “is not really necessary except as an asset protection strategy” 
(2004:18). However, a case can be made that these production conditions
established the artistic, commercial, cultural and social boundaries of the
comic book.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

	Comics entail collaborative practices in various ways: not only because
they most often are the product of cultural industries based on a division of
labor, but also on a formal level because of their fragmented structure. As
Jared Gardner argues in <i>Projections</i>, "comics bring together different
semantic systems (figural, textual, symbolic) into a crowded field where
meaning is both collaborative and competitive – between images, between
frames, and between reader and writer" (xi). Creating comics as well as
reading them are collaborative activities. In this post, I would like to
comment on Emmanuel Guibert’s recent <i>L’enfance d’Alan</i> (2012), where
the collaborative structure of the work is dependent on its collaborative
production.

	<i>L’enfance d’Alan</i> [Alan’s childhood] is the ‘sequel’ to <i>La
guerre d’Alan</i> [Alan’s war], which was serialized in three volumes by
L’Association. It focuses on the childhood of Alan Ingram Cope, a WWII
soldier who eventually settled in France. Emmanuel Guibert met Cope by
chance, when asking him for directions. They became friends and Cope started
telling him his stories. Alan Ingram Cope passed away in 1999, just before
the release of the first volume in 2000. <i>La guerre d’Alan</i> and
<i>L’enfance d’Alan</i> result from these taped conversations.

	That is not the kind of collaboration one might have in mind when talking
about comics: it does not rely on a strict division of labor (writer,
penciller, inker, colorist, and so on), and Emmanuel Guibert is clearly an
author who, in this particular case, carries out (nearly) all the facets of
the creative work by himself. In the preface to the collected edition of
<i>La guerre d’Alan</i>, Guibert mentioned that Cope gave him carte blanche
to draw his life, only correcting some minor technical details. Cope does not
provide a script, he is not creating a fictional story as a professional
writer, he is simply telling his life-story for Guibert to pin down,
primarily because of the friendship that formed between both men. Thinking
about Peter’s post, collaboration might in this case first be ‘love’ instead
of ‘work’.

	Even though Cope’s actual participation in the creative production seems
minor–he ‘merely’ recounts his life to the artist–, his words are the only
textual elements present in the comic books. The captions that run throughout
are all extracted from Cope’s oral storytelling and Guibert chose to
restitute his stories as he told them, transcribing them as faithfully as
possible. His own work consists in operating a selection, placing the textual
bits within panels and page arrangements, and illustrating them. From that
perspective, Guibert’s role could be relegated to that of ‘mere’ illustrator.
Of course, trying to impose such a hierarchy seems rather futile and
unproductive: despite its auteurist appearance, it clearly is the result of a
productive collaboration, where both parts are equally essential.

	Following the boundary between text and image, this collaboration, where
the text is Cope’s and the art and composition Guibert’s, results in a
complex narratological structure. As Jan Baetens remarks: “although author
and character coincide, the position of the narrator of this graphic novel is
radically split. It is Alan Ingram Cope himself who tells his own story, but
what he says is in a certain sense quoted within the broader narrative made
by Emmanuel Guibert” (84). This split narratological structure runs along the
divide between text and image, resulting in a complex mix of autobiography
and biography, first- and third-person narrative, objectivity and
subjectivity which can help us revisit the traditional
author-character-narrator coincidence postulated by Lejeune as the defining
criterion for autobiography (Baetens 83-84).

	<i>L’enfance d’Alan</i> might draw this split narration even further than
<i>La guerre d’Alan</i> by integrating Guibert’s own immersion in the
material in a more substantial way than before. In the preface to <i>La
guerre d’Alan</i>, Guibert writes:

	&nbsp; <blockquote>Probably because I was missing Alan, the more I was
progressing, the more I felt the need to link my personal history more
closely with his own. Some time before his death, he had encouraged me to go
to California . . . I did it. I had at hand the photographs from the 30s he
had passed on to me, and I wandered through the streets of Pasadena and
Altadena in search for the houses of his childhood. I found some of them,
along with the schools he went to and the church where he sung.

	(4; my translation)</blockquote> &nbsp;

	Although these words are part of the paratext of <i>La guerre d’Alan</i>,
they describe a process that is much more apparent in <i>L’enfance
d’Alan</i>, which clearly bears the traces of Guibert’s search in his
friend’s footsteps.

	&nbsp;

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Image1.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3491" alt="Image1"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Image1.jpg"
width="450" height="332" /></a>

	This is evident right from the beginning. The first pages, the only ones
in color, function as a kind of prologue to the story. The text follows, as
in <i>La guerre d’Alan</i>, Alan’s narrative voice, who shares his memories
of Southern California. He talks about the impact of the war, the changes it
brought about in the surrounding landscape: the tremendous growth in
population, the arrival of cars, the pollution. The images illustrate this
theme of change in a way that mingles Guibert’s travel to California, in
search for traces of his friend’s childhood. The first pages, all in color,
only consist of spread pages, each turn of the page supplanting one image to
the other in a cinematic way. These pages are further reminiscent of the
traditional movie sequence of a car ride shot with an onboard camera. They
offer snapshots of a road trip in 21st century California, built up of
skyscrapers and large multi-lane highways. This sequence does not address
directly the post-war changes that affected Alan’s homeland, but records the
changes that Guibert is confronted with in his search for Alan’s past.

	Guibert also incorporates many of the photographs he inherited from Alan
into the narrative by drawing them in a slightly more detailed style that
foregrounds their original status. This sustained reliance on (drawn)
photographs further reflects the imaginative act involved in Guibert’s
illustrating work. As Alan probably commented on these many photographs,
Guibert often uses them as narrative images, expanding their story into the
comic.

	&nbsp;

	<a

class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3492" alt="Image2"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Image2.jpg"
width="1716" height="1299" /></a>

	In a particularly interesting fragment, Alan gives a tender and intimate
portrait of his mother, sketching a broad picture as well as mentioning some
poignant details (30-34). The images that accompany this description are not
illustrations in the sense that they do not picture the events or details
Alan is referring to. However, they are illustrative on a thematic level
insofar as they depict an intimate moment between Alan and his mother: the
sequence follows, along four pages, Alan being dressed by his mother in what
appears to be a mariner’s outfit. The last image of the sequence, cleverly
situated on a left page and thus coming as a surprise effect with the turn of
the page, reveals a photograph of Alan dressed in his outfit, in the arms of
his mother.

	&nbsp;

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Image3.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3493" alt="Image3"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Image3.jpg"
width="1088" height="1620" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	Just as the road sequence could be associated with Guibert’s travel, the
visual sequence here unveils Guibert’s imaginative work to record the history
of the photograph, and to get at a sense of Alan’s life beyond the material
he is left with. His biographical undertaking implies making do with the
material he has accumulated while Alan was still alive. Therefore, telling
his friend’s story after his death involves an act of reconstruction which is
necessarily associative.

	<i>La guerre d’Alan</i> and<i> L’enfance d’Alan</i> show a different kind
of collaboration in comics. They are not the product of a team of
professional artists working together, but results from the meeting of a
comics artist with an American expatriate willing to share his story. If they
can be seen as an autobiography since we get to read Alan’s own words, they
differ from the auteurist autobiographical mode which French cartoonists
embraced in the 1990s. We could see them as a collaborative autobiography,
where Alan’s account of his own life is inseparable from Guibert’s act of
remediation. The collaboration seeps into the relation between text and image
of the comic, where each mode convey a distinct narrative voice. In
<i>L’enfance d’Alan</i>, the cartoonist’s work of immersion in his friend’s
life reaches a point where it oddly becomes a form of self-exploration, one
that is visually recorded and that parallels Alan’s own self-narrative.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[In a previous
<em>Graphixia</em> sequence on things that we hated in comics, I chose to
write about overly saturated, glossy art. This post that initiates a sequence
on color in comics has an ironic relationship to that earlier post. The
example I chose of the art that I did not like was from <em>Mind the
Gap.</em> I started on <em>Mind the Gap</em> by mistake. I had read somewhere
that there was a fabulous comic with the word “mind” in the title, but I
couldn’t remember what the rest of the title was. I thought I had hit upon it
when I found <em>Mind the Gap</em>, and read several issues, with increasing
dismay, until I discovered that it was Matt Kindt’s <em>Mind MGMT</em> that I
was really looking for. In terms of look, <em>Mind MGMT</em> is the
antithesis of <em>Mind the Gap</em>: sketchy lines and daubs of watercolors
create a viewing experience that seems raw, warm, and immediate in
comparison. In this post, I am trying to get at why that appeals to me so
much, particulary when it comes to colour. If any aspect of comics reveals my
ignorance of art in any technical sense, it is colour. I don’t understand how
colour works at all. But, I suppose, I know what I like.

	When I was a kid, reading American comics from Marvel (mostly) and DC, I
took colour for granted. Comics always had colour as a matter of course. The
kind of colour they had in the mid–70s was whatever could characterize the
gritty American city, mainly New York. The atmosphere was dark. I think
colour in comics at that time was influenced by two cinematic phenomena: noir
(like <em>Chinatown</em>) and urban police stories (like <em>Serpico</em> and
the <em>French Connection</em>), though I have no evidence for this. Though
these phenomena were stylized and fantastic, it was common at the time to
take them as “realistic.” The only comic that broke this mould was Superman,
and consequently I never read it; it was too bright and sunny. I prefered the
colours of Spider-man.

	It took European comics like <em>Tintin</em> and <em>Asterix</em> to make
me appreciate bright, bold colours. Such blue skies. No sky was ever the
brilliant blue of a Gaul sky, but that didn’t matter. The artificial flatness
and brightness of Franco-Belgian comics made me consider that it was alright
that the world looked nothing like this because colour could be emblematic as
well as realistic; I wished the world was in those colours. The “ligne
claire” style lends itself to a certain precision that the colours inform
while they also remind us that precision does not equal realism: quite the
contrary.

	<a

Tintin_and_the_Picaros_Egmont.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full
wp-image-3504" alt="Tintin_and_the_Picaros_Egmont"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/
Tintin_and_the_Picaros_Egmont.jpg" width="650" height="900" /></a>

	Then, when I was about 15 (1977 maybe), I picked up some Marvel comics on
a family trip to the UK. I was stunned to discover that they were not only in
a different format–short and wide–but also that they were in black and white.
In <em>The Avengers</em>, it was strange to see Captain America, not in his
red, white, and blue, but in mere outline. At the time I was disconcerted, I
couldn’t figure out whether I had been ripped off, or whether it was kind of
neat to have comics presented to me in this new (to me) form. Those English
<em>Avengers</em> comics perhaps gave me what I now get from looking at Bryan
Lee O’Malley’s black and white <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> or the work of the
Hernandez brothers: a sense of openness and empty space, an unsaturated
world. My pleasure could come from either allowing my imagination to fill in
colour where it is missing, or, more likely, from having less visual
information to register.

	On reflection, I believe that colour in comics acts as an aesthetic, and
perhaps cognitive, block for me. There is something about colour that stops
me getting at something else: the austerity of the inked line, the either/or
contrast of black and white, the pull of a partly unfinished world.

	Somehow, Matt Kindt’s watercolors in <em>Mind MGMT</em> manage to satisfy
me in a way that black and white comics generally do. That is, rather than
being an interference, or simply a neutral element, Kindt’s watercolors
maintain the allure of the “unfinished” that I get from black and white.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Mind-MGMT-12-Cover1.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3502"
alt="Mind-MGMT-12-Cover1"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Mind-MGMT-12-Cover1.
jpg" width="600" height="923" /></a>

	In an interview with <em><a
href="http://m.bloody-disgusting.com/bloodydisgusting/#!/entry/nycc-13-matt-
kindt-talks-drawing-mind-mgmt,525c5147da27f5d9d0342e0c/2">Bloody
Disgusting</a></em>, Kindt talks about how he originally worked with black
and white and then added watercolour one day and never went back.

	This quality of Kindt’s work stems from its “handmade” appearance.
<em>Mind MGMT</em> is the opposite of “ligne claire”, the lines are sketchy,
kind of chaotic, and the colour is beautifully daubed and layered, and yet
semi-transparent in the way that watercolor is, giving the effect of still
being able to see the paper through the color; the colour stains rather than
saturates or obliterates the page. Indeed, there are blank, “white” spaces
everywhere, places where the color has not covered the visible surface. The
effect is a kind of aura, style, feel, that is both radically unlike most
comics, and yet exemplifies everything I like about comics: the combination
of rawness and beauty.

	I don’t usually associate water colours with comics, but there’s
something compelling about the broad strokes and semi-intentional blotches of
colour and not always staying within the lines, as if the brush is too big
and it’s impossible to do really fine work perfectly. Colour spills out of
the panels; the lines around the panels sometimes don’t join up, or one line
goes a little further than it should. Adjectives like “primitive” and
“childlike” come to mind, but do not adequately describe the work. When I
close my eyes and think of conventional comics colours, I see reds, blues,
bright yellows and greens. When I do the same and think about <em>Mind
MGMT</em> I see purples, pinks, and softer yellows.

	Certainly, I am participating in a kind of mystification in celebrating
“the handmade.” For all I know, Kindt uses extensive computerization in the
production of his comics, and, with <em>Bandette</em>, Paul Tobin and Colleen
Coover have produce a beautiful handmade-looking comic entirely produced on
the computer. Dave Stewart, the colorist for Fabio Moon and Gabriel Ba’s
<em>Daytripper</em>, captures this strange ideological dichotomy between
computer and hand coloring: <blockquote> <blockquote>I use the Cintiq
monitor, which Is amazing. I just try to use it as a big paint set. I’d
rather try to paint in an effect than let the computer do it. I try to hide
the cold, technical side of the computer and let the warmth of the human hand
take over. <a
href="http://comicsalliance.com/dave-stewart-interview-coloring/">Comics
Alliance</a></blockquote> </blockquote> Obviously, we’ve never left the world
of Fritz Lang’s <em>Metropolis</em> in our thinking about the relationship
between technology and the handmade in the psyche.

	While Kindt gives the appearance of having drawn and painted the very
pages we are looking at in <em>Mind MGMT,</em> he superimposes the comic grid
on a report form, drawing an opposition between the “organicism” of his art
and the mechanics of the form with its stringent requirements: “When filing
report all essential details must fall within this solid ‘live area’ box.
This is the border for a standard non-bleed field report.”

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mind-mgmt-opening-
sequence.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3503"
alt="mind-mgmt-opening-sequence"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mind-mgmt-opening-
sequence.jpg" width="600" height="905" /></a>

	Of course some of the “details” of the comic violate these requirements.
Furthermore, <em>Mind MGMT</em> is a sort of sci-fi detective story in which
characters with wild mental talents are harnessed by government powers who
essentially try to turn them into tools. The story is that of incalculable,
raw talent subsumed by the mechanical, instrumental, bureaucratic world.
Hence, the presentation of the page in <em>Mind MGMT</em> is part of the idea
system of the work. The comics grid and the conceptual grid fit together
nicely. The regularity of the report form, and even the structure of the
panels of the page enter into a meaningful contest with the colors and
drawing.

	Changes in typography, paper size, and margins no doubt affect the way we
experience prose fiction, but do they radically transform the content, the
words, in anything but an accidental way? Is colour in comics equivalent to
typography in prose fiction? To answer this question we would have to do a
detailed analysis of reader’s responses to the differences between the colour
and black and white versions of the same text, say Bryan Lee O’Malley’s
<em>Scott Pilgrim</em> which is being re-released in colourized form. We
should probably conduct such analyses because it would help us understand the
differences and similarities between comics and prose narratives in terms of
how we process information.

	Meanwhile, I leave you with my naive reflection on the pleasure of Matt
Kindt’s watercolors.]]></content:encoded>

juxtaposition that for comics&#8211;and a lot of other things&#8211;a lack of

colour on the other hand, makes comics &#8220;underground,&#8221;
&#8220;independent,&#8221; &#8220;adult,&#8221; &#8220;intellectual,&#8221;
and all the other superlatives that we toss around when we want to call
comics an artform.

	I&#8217;ve often wondered whether the black and white legitimization of
comics has some relationship to our favouring of the black and white cast of
text in a novel, or the two-colour black and sepia of the parchment. In other
words, a lack of colour allows the critic to attach a literary value to the
images since those images can be more readily associated with traditional
modes of literary production&#8211;like type.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/will_eisner.jpg"><

size-large wp-image-3513" /></a>

	Now I hear the grumbling. Independent, avant-garde, whatever comics are
black and white because they are cheaply produced, unable to afford the
expensive marshalling of primary hues. Well, maybe, but there&#8217;s too
often a situation where a lack of colour seems to imply gravitas. Take for
example Art Speigelman&#8217;s <em>Maus</em>, often brought forward as the
first outstanding contribution to comic-based story-telling. Can one even
image what <em>Maus</em> would be like as a full colour spread? There are
moments of colour in independent or &#8220;literary&#8221; comics like
<em>Maus</em>, or those by Satrapi, Sacco, Eisner, Lutes, Bechdel, Sim (that
list alone proves my point really well), namely in the covers. But, most of
the time, a lack of colour means something significant; it means the story in
the comic is heavy, rarefied, thoughtful, insightful. It means the comic has
something important to say, something that <em>Superman</em> or
<em>Batman</em> or <em>Archie</em>&#8211;almost always printed in primary
colours&#8211;either don&#8217;t say or don&#8217;t want to say.

	Even when comics drift away from that traditional primary colour palette,
it means something. So, if not a lack of colour, a shift in colour palette
means something. Take for instance Dave Gibbons&#8217; move away from the
traditional palette in the ground-breaking <em>Watchmen</em>, or
Miller&#8217;s overly dark palette in <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>.
Again, a turn away from the expectations of colour suggests legitimacy, or a
turn away from the commodity of comics toward something with resonance and
substance&#8211;something that a book like <em>Hawkeye</em> is also doing so
kudos to Matt Hollingsworth.

	Point is, colour functions as a the property of commodity. Colour is
advertising, colour is attention-getting. In short, its all the things we
hate about mass-produced imagery and symbolism. We rarely talk about colour
unless we are taking about it as in opposition to something, like I am
now&#8211;black and white, different palettes. Oddly, colour seems to suggest
a kind of cheap, mass-produced sensibility to the image. Even more oddly, I
have no idea where this sensibility comes from or why it still holds, even
today. A lot of comics, especially the slice of life, memoir,
historiographical productions that currently dominate the
&#8220;literary&#8221; comics market still seem bent of doing two-colour or
non-colour spreads.

	What&#8217;s important here is to recognize that colour for comics seems
to be the mark of the establishment. It&#8217;s a particular kind of colour
carry ing that mark too&#8211;a primary colour emphasis often overtly crisp
and saturated. It&#8217;s also important to recognize that colour, as such a
representative thing, is therefore entangled in the political dichotomy that
itself marks comic production. A statement against primary colours is a
statement against the establishment. While it sometimes legitimizes itself in
terms of economics, non-colour in comics is also a political statement
against what is often perceived as a canned narrative or repetitive storyline
toward something more universal, more symbolically rich.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/imac_g3.jpeg"><img

alt="7.1" width="300" height="289" class="aligncenter size-medium
wp-image-3511" /></a>

	It&#8217;s always so surprising to me that comics once again seem to
inherently reflect the cultural vibe surrounding it. Pause for a moment and
think different about what a company like Apple has co-opted in terms of
colour. The company&#8217;s comeback was marked by a push in tangerine,
blueberry, and green apple&#8211;a move completely off the tope /
green-digit-dos palette we expected for home computers. Now, positioned as
one of the most innovative corporations in the world, we salivate over the
white iphone (it&#8217;s telling that the original iphone came only in
black&#8211;a nod to Henry Ford&#8217;s Model T) and the recently introduced
gold iphone 5S&#8211;again, off the palette. Again, the trajectory of comics,
the symbolism and entrenched ideologies that mark the artform launch
gleefully into the world of high-tech marketing, providing the archetype for
legitimizing that technology as innovative and independent. Understanding how
colour works as a metaphor for the establishment in comics gives way to the
symbolisms activated by its absence.]]></content:encoded>

for Archie Comics, see.[/caption]

	We've been talking colour around here at Graphixia, and it's a handy
thing we are because I've been thinking a lot about how colour functions in a
new, totally terrific series I've been reading lately: <em><a
href="http://afterlifewitharchie.com">Afterlife with Archie</a></em>. It's
sort of a very-special-episode with a zombie apocalypse twist, where
<em>Archie Comics</em> get very serious with a T-rated horror series (it's a
riff on <em>Life with Archie</em>, get it?) by the dynamic super-villain team
of Francesco Francavilla and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. And listen, even as a
long-time fan of <em>Archie</em> for playground fun, I was surprised by this
one. It's complicated, dark, and adds some genuinely challenging layers to
the <em>Archie</em> paradigms. In fact, it deals better with some of
<em>Archie</em>'s most recent challenging story lines than the standard story
lines have.

	When <a title="#156 – If It’s Colour, It’s Crap: Of Palettes and
Establishments"
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/02/26/155-if-its-colour-its-crap-of
-palettes-and-establishments/">I read Dave's post last week</a>, I realized
that <em>Afterlife with Archi</em>e is a good case study for the ideas he was
playing with. Dave notes that, in the throw away world of (as Damon helpfully
pointed out via the Twitterspehere, North American!) weekly comics, garish
colour denotes their cheap nature: <blockquote>The thing about colour is that
it makes comics cheap and mainstream. A lack of colour on the other hand,
makes comics “underground,” “independent,” “adult,” “intellectual,” and all
the other superlatives that we toss around when we want to call comics an
artform.</blockquote> <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/photo-1.png"><img
class="size-medium wp-image-3526 alignleft" alt=""
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/photo-1-225x300.png"
width="225" height="300" /></a>

	But where Dave was talking about the preference for black and white in
serious, literary-type comics, I want to talk about the use of monochrome
orange and black in <em>Afterlife with Archie</em> to denote the tone shift
from the happy-go-lucky world of traditional <em>Archie Comics</em> to this
particularly dark, grim, and black world. The comics are not entirely
monochromatic: Francesco Francavilla uses a range of oranges, yellows, blues,
and greys to narrow the usual broad spectrum of primary colours and create a
creepy, complex mood.

	The traditional <em>Archie</em> colour palette, like many of the penny
comics of its era, is a bubble gum primary one: bright colours like Archie's
signature orange hair and red letterman sweater, for example, or Betty's not
subtle blonde but rather bright yellow hair. The bright, simple colours align
with the bright, simple plot lines. As Dave remarks: <blockquote>What’s
important here is to recognize that colour for comics seems to be the mark of
the establishment. It’s a particular kind of colour carry ing that mark too–a
primary colour emphasis often overtly crisp and saturated.</blockquote>
There's nothing safer or more establishment than an <em>Archie Comic</em>,
right?

	But the colour scheme of <em>Afterlife with Archie</em> signals something
different. Caution: serious comic ahead! The simplified colour palette here,
as Dave gestured to last week, suggests something significant:
<blockquote>Even when comics drift away from that traditional primary colour
palette, it means something. So, if not a lack of colour, a shift in colour
palette means something.</blockquote> <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/photo-2.png"><img
class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3525" alt="photo 2"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/photo-2-225x300.png"
width="225" height="300" /></a>Here it signals to us the significant thematic
shift in the comic to a world of <em>Archie</em> where Betty and Veronica
dress provocatively and make nasty, slut-shaming comments to each other; the
Principal and Miss Grundy get all flirty once they're out of the eyesight of
students; Reggie kills a dog and makes vaguely date-rape-y jokes; Cheryl
Blossom (once too risqué for the <em>Archie</em> universe) has a weirdly
incestuous relationship with her brother; and Nancy and Ginger are lesbians
who consciously call out the fact that only "perfect" gays get to live in
Riverdale, <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2013/04/02/110-can-archie-comics-come-of
-age-going-gay-in-gay-old-riverdale/">as I pointed out a few months back</a>.
People die in this Riverdale, and in really horrific ways, too.

	I recommend you check out this new <em>Archie</em> alternate universe,
even if you're not typically a fan. It's a different take on Riverdale that
is definitely worth a second look. But it's also a concrete example of what
Dave was talking about: the full-colour spectrum denotes the throw-away, and
alternative colour palettes let you know when to get serious about
comics.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Colour is a subject
that was rarely explored or even acknowledged in<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/
New_York_Worlds_Fair_1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3533"
alt="New_York_World's_Fair_1"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/
New_York_Worlds_Fair_1-216x300.jpg" width="216" height="300" /></a> comics in
their earliest days – colour was simply a given, with a palette of four
colours used in various lackluster combinations as a standard. Black and
white was reserved for newspaper offerings, and the general expectation from
the advent of the regular comic book (beginning essentially with Classics
Illustrated) was that comic images required a colourist in order to be
published and purchased. This presented some problems early on when
consistency was also expected, however, with a notable example being one of
Superman’s first appearances in <i>The New York World’s Fair Comics</i> #1 in
April of 1939 in which he actually had blonde hair – it’s an interesting
exercise to think on how something as simple as an alternate hair colour
changes our understanding of iconic characters.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/blond_superman-
e1394521151493.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3534"
alt="blond_superman"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/blond_superman-
e1394521151493.jpg" width="162" height="165" /></a>The visual discrepancy
highlights a key point that we don’t often recognize about comics: more than
facial characteristics, more than consistency in storytelling and character
development, more than nearly any other element of comics, expectations of
colour are demanded by their readers once they’ve been established. Colour
often carries with it subtle (and not so subtle) meanings: the red and blue
costume of Superman representing American idealism (as in Captain America, as
in Spider-Man), the blue-blacks and grays of Batman representing a lack of
allegiance to laws in his vigilantism, the browns and yellows of Wolverine
representing his animal nature and ferocity, the green of Green Lantern
stressing something both alien yet natural – bound in these colours are the
metaphors of identity and what they’re meant to represent to the reader in
term of ideals.

	We don’t discuss them, likely, because they’re difficult to pin down and
even more difficult to agree on, as even with the short list above I’m sure
I’d encounter a few alternate and heated perspectives in Wednesday comic shop
debates, let alone with my readers here. Regardless of what you think of as
being the meaning behind the colouring, whether in hair, costume, skin tone
or landscape, it’s difficult to argue with the fact that it carries embedded
meaning. Draw his chiseled jaw more softly, give him stubble, have him curse
or even kill, and Superman is still Superman. Try to imagine him in a green
costume (or give him blond hair) however, and this is no longer the case.
Even in radical alterations of continuity by authors who want to put their
own stamp on a character or genre, dramatic colouring differences are never
even attempted, as both artists and readers know they would fail.

	Scott McCloud’s theory of reduction can be applied here, though it’s not
quite what he intended it for: when we encounter a drawing that is
photorealistic, we see only the specific image and are drawn along a single
narrative pathway. As images become more, say, “comicky,” with starker lines
and less shading, they become universal, allowing us to imbue them with
everyman qualities and inject ourselves into the storytelling:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/McCloud21.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3537" alt="McCloud2"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/McCloud21.jpg"
width="596" height="297" /></a>

	Applied to colouring in comics, this logic has a twofold effect here – it
both heightens our sensitivity to the metaphors that are intended by the
colourist to elicit, while at the same time allowing all of our subjective
applications of what we suppose that metaphor <i>should</i> elicit because
they’re never overtly stated. And unlike in dialogue or even image, we are
rarely trained to be aware of these responses, and so they operate
predominantly on a subconscious level.

	This is not to say that mainstream comics do not experiment with
colourless stories for well-known characters; they certainly do, but when
this happens they typically draw great attention to this fact for a
particular purpose. The currently running DC title “Batman: Black and White”
is a key example – now in its second (or third?) volume, the miniseries
offers short tales, ranging from three to ten pages at most, that showcase
particular artists while offering brief biographies of what they offer to the
industry. Operating outside of continuity, these stories are there to be able
to highlight the “art” of Batman, allowing the reader not to get lost in the
metaphors that colour provides and instead concentrate on the pencils of the
artist and the story itself. This tactic also ostensibly plays to the
standard approach to understanding black and white as being the domain of the
indie comic that assumes a loftier goal in terms of depth and storytelling,
and the vignettes in the series typically shoot for this kind of high art.
Despite this dramatic purpose, however, it’s ultimately ineffective, as we’re
too familiar with what the colours should be already – the characters and
scenes draw upon so deep a history that they may as well already be coloured.
Reading a black and white Batman brooding over Gotham, it is hard to imagine
a single reader envisioning him in anything other than a black and grey
costume with a wet, rusty gray pall cast over the cityscape. <p
style="text-align: left;">The “sketch cover,” now a staple of the mainstream
comics’ industry, is perhaps a little more effective here, as it offers as a
variant a single image that has been reduced (or enhanced) to colourlessness
for collectors. Placing these side by side, we can see how great an impact
that colour can have on a reader, and Michael Turner’s beautifully detailed
Civil War covers, each released with a 1:75 sketch variant, work well to
highlight the point:</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/
civilwar1turner1in25lrghd6.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3547
aligncenter" alt="civilwar1turner1in25lrghd6"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/
civilwar1turner1in25lrghd6.jpg" width="350" height="537" /></a></p> <p
style="text-align: left;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/civil-war-1-turner-
sketch1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3544"
alt="civil-war-1-turner-sketch"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/civil-war-1-turner-
sketch1.jpg" width="325" height="495" /></a></p> The contrast is striking,
but difficult to define in terms of reader response. Is the colourless cover
more of an art object now that it is in pencil, with only a single
contributor? Does it represent the story within in the same way as the
original, coloured cover, and is it even supposed to? Is it really any
different at all, as we implicitly know what colours should be present
because we’re familiar with the characters already? Despite these arguably
intentional ambiguities, we can’t help but acknowledge that the coloured
panel or page “reads” differently for all of the meanings that colour evokes,
as does its absence when we find it missing from a space in which we assume
it belongs.

	Colour is a metonym of the most personal nature, and it ushers forth
meanings that are significant to us precisely because we don’t realize that
they’re there. Black and white may allow us to fill the empty spaces with
what we think should be present, but colour comics do this work for us and
thereby allow the chosen colours to carry meaning and weight, adding another
layer to the intertextuality that we’re more trained for when accessing
dialogue or even juxtaposed images.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Other than a Twirl
(“You can’t top the taste of a Twirl”) my absolute favourite dirty* chocolate
snack is a bag of Revels. For those of you unfamiliar with Revels they are a
chocolate coated sweet with a possibility of five different centres. Revels
offer me just enough tastebud excitement without verging on the kerrr-azy
territory of bacon chocolate and even if I get my least favourite Malteaser
one I know that the next one is possibly going to be a coffee one (best revel
of all). Revels really do have it all.

	&nbsp;

	Worry not, dear reader, they have not secretly changed Graphixia to
become a confectionary blog, rather I am trying in my own clumsy way to
describe what it is that is just so lovely about <em>Nelson</em>, the subject
of this post here today. <em>Nelson</em> is a so-called “collective graphic
novel” published in 2011, edited by Rob Davis and Woodrow Phoenix and the
fruits of a collaboration between 54 (yes, you did read that correctly)
artists. In brief <em>Nelson</em> tells the story of one Nel, born in London
in 1968, Nel’s parents thought she was going to be a boy and so were going to
call him Nelson, instead they had twins, Nel and Sonny, though Sonny died
very soon after his birth. The spectre of her twin brother haunts Nel
throughout the book and the responsibility of living for the both of them
weighs heavily upon her. The story is told via a series of 54 snapshots set
in the years between 1968 and 2011. Each section is by a different artist and
the range of styles, colours and tones across the whole book is breathtaking.
It was the first publication from the UKCC, United Kingdom Comics Collective,
but I really hope for lots more.

	&nbsp;

	I love the idea of anthologies and the prospect of reading work by
new-to-me creators, however when I find one that I love or a story I am
engrossed in I find myself getting frustrated by the end of that contribution
by the fact that it is over so soon.  I was therefore unsure about
<em>Nelson</em> but swayed enough by the gallons of praise being poured upon
it on Twitter to give it a try. And surprise, surprise I loved it. Nel is an
engaging heroine right from the very start and it is a delight to see her
character developing and being fleshed out as different artists get their
hands on her. The overarching storyline of Nel’s life, loves and various
careers is handled deftly with enough continuity to ensure that the story
continues to flow throughout. However it isn’t just Nel that stands out as a
great character, the people that surround her, her emotionally damaged
parents, her oh-so perfect sister and her best friend Tabitha are all given
the space and time to become integral parts of Nel’s history. Given the sheer
logistical difficulties involved in coordinating 54 different artists to tell
one story I find the way in which secondary characters are handled
particularly effective.

	The impact of each artist being given a distinct time period in Nel’s
life is two fold, the change in tone created by the differences in style
between the enormous number of artists gives each section a truly distinct
feeling that underlines the enormous changes that Nel’s undergoes throughout
her life. The amount of attention that must have gone into deciding upon the
order in which the artists would appear in the book and which sections of
Nel’s life they would each approach must have been enormous and you can tell
the care and attention that was put into decisions like this. For example the
transition between Warren Pleece’s contribution for 1988 with its bright
colours and strong lines to the gentle, muted and regimented work of Kristina
Baczynski for 1989 perfectly reflects the changes happening in Nel’s life at
this point. In 1988 she is an art student in Manchester and in control of
almost every aspect of her own life however by the time we see her again in
1989 she has left Art School and has returned to living with her mum.
Pleece’s work breaks free of its frames and ably reflects Nel’s own desire to
break down the structures that she feels so constrained by. However by the
time she is returning home to live with her mum, her life is being forced
back to fit into one room again and so Baczkynski’s neat and even drawings
with its regular use of very small frames perfectly reflects the way in which
Nel’s life and personality is being constrained by these changes.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Similarly after Nel’s father’s death as she struggles with work, life and
her mental health, the style of the artwork is distinctly more muted in tone,
as Nel struggles to maintain control of her students, her drinking and her
life, she finally reaches a crisis point in 2002 and Duncan Fegredo’s use of
simple blue and sepia tones to depict this pivotal moment fits perfectly.
Philippa Rice’s naïve and childlike figures follow this section and again
this underlines the way in which Nel is rebuilding her life from the ground
up following her breakdown.

	&nbsp;

	‘Nelson’ doesn’t just work as a novel or gimmicky way in which to
demonstrate the range and scope of comics artistry on offer in the United
Kingdom today. I did, of course, thoroughly enjoy the opportunity to see the
work of new-to-me artists that I have since read more of. However to my mind
the really awesome thing about ‘Nelson’ is just she sheer scope and
achievement of this collaboration and how it was the perfect way to tell this
story. Normally when we discuss collaboration in comics we’re talking about
collaborations between a handful of creators, usually each taking
responsibility for a distinct area of the comics’ production. Nelson offers a
different model of comics collaboration that tells a simple story in a novel
and exciting way. Without wanting an inundation of cheap imitations I would
love to see another story told in this way, few stories and characters over
recent years have touched me as much as Nel and her life's tale.

	&nbsp;

beautifully bitter, herb scented chocolate that I am probably meant to claim
I love above all things.

Establishments</title>
<link>http://www.graphixia.ca/2014/02/155-if-its-colour-its-crap-of-palettes-

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[It&#8217;s an odd
juxtaposition that for comics&#8211;and a lot of other things&#8211;a lack of
colour makes what is often thought of as a disposable commodity into Art. The
thing about colour is that it makes comics cheap and mainstream. A lack of
colour on the other hand, makes comics &#8220;underground,&#8221;
&#8220;independent,&#8221; &#8220;adult,&#8221; &#8220;intellectual,&#8221;
and all the other superlatives that we toss around when we want to call
comics an artform.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/maus_gate.jpg"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/maus_gate.jpg"
alt="maus_gate" width="460" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full
wp-image-3512" /></a>

	I&#8217;ve often wondered whether the black and white legitimization of
comics has some relationship to our favouring of the black and white cast of
text in a novel, or the two-colour black and sepia of the parchment. In other
words, a lack of colour allows the critic to attach a literary value to the
images since those images can be more readily associated with traditional
modes of literary production&#8211;like type.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/will_eisner.jpg"><
img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/will_eisner-1024x682.
jpg" alt="will_eisner" width="1024" height="682" class="aligncenter
size-large wp-image-3513" /></a>

	Now I hear the grumbling. Independent, avant-garde, whatever comics are
black and white because they are cheaply produced, unable to afford the
expensive marshalling of primary hues. Well, maybe, but there&#8217;s too
often a situation where a lack of colour seems to imply gravitas. Take for
example Art Speigelman&#8217;s <em>Maus</em>, often brought forward as the
first outstanding contribution to comic-based story-telling. Can one even
image what <em>Maus</em> would be like as a full colour spread? There are
moments of colour in independent or &#8220;literary&#8221; comics like
<em>Maus</em>, or those by Satrapi, Sacco, Eisner, Lutes, Bechdel, Sim (that
list alone proves my point really well), namely in the covers. But, most of
the time, a lack of colour means something significant; it means the story in
the comic is heavy, rarefied, thoughtful, insightful. It means the comic has
something important to say, something that <em>Superman</em> or
<em>Batman</em> or <em>Archie</em>&#8211;almost always printed in primary
colours&#8211;either don&#8217;t say or don&#8217;t want to say.

	Even when comics drift away from that traditional primary colour palette,
it means something. So, if not a lack of colour, a shift in colour palette
means something. Take for instance Dave Gibbons&#8217; move away from the
traditional palette in the ground-breaking <em>Watchmen</em>, or
Miller&#8217;s overly dark palette in <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>.
Again, a turn away from the expectations of colour suggests legitimacy, or a
turn away from the commodity of comics toward something with resonance and
substance&#8211;something that a book like <em>Hawkeye</em> is also doing so
kudos to Matt Hollingsworth.

	Point is, colour functions as a the property of commodity. Colour is
advertising, colour is attention-getting. In short, its all the things we
hate about mass-produced imagery and symbolism. We rarely talk about colour
unless we are taking about it as in opposition to something, like I am
now&#8211;black and white, different palettes. Oddly, colour seems to suggest
a kind of cheap, mass-produced sensibility to the image. Even more oddly, I
have no idea where this sensibility comes from or why it still holds, even
today. A lot of comics, especially the slice of life, memoir,
historiographical productions that currently dominate the
&#8220;literary&#8221; comics market still seem bent of doing two-colour or
non-colour spreads.

	What&#8217;s important here is to recognize that colour for comics seems
to be the mark of the establishment. It&#8217;s a particular kind of colour
carry ing that mark too&#8211;a primary colour emphasis often overtly crisp
and saturated. It&#8217;s also important to recognize that colour, as such a
representative thing, is therefore entangled in the political dichotomy that
itself marks comic production. A statement against primary colours is a
statement against the establishment. While it sometimes legitimizes itself in
terms of economics, non-colour in comics is also a political statement
against what is often perceived as a canned narrative or repetitive storyline
toward something more universal, more symbolically rich.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/imac_g3.jpeg"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/imac_g3-300x289.jpeg"
alt="7.1" width="300" height="289" class="aligncenter size-medium
wp-image-3511" /></a>

	It&#8217;s always so surprising to me that comics once again seem to
inherently reflect the cultural vibe surrounding it. Pause for a moment and
think different about what a company like Apple has co-opted in terms of
colour. The company&#8217;s comeback was marked by a push in tangerine,
blueberry, and green apple&#8211;a move completely off the tope /
green-digit-dos palette we expected for home computers. Now, positioned as
one of the most innovative corporations in the world, we salivate over the
white iphone (it&#8217;s telling that the original iphone came only in
black&#8211;a nod to Henry Ford&#8217;s Model T) and the recently introduced
gold iphone 5S&#8211;again, off the palette. Again, the trajectory of comics,
the symbolism and entrenched ideologies that mark the artform launch
gleefully into the world of high-tech marketing, providing the archetype for
legitimizing that technology as innovative and independent. Understanding how
colour works as a metaphor for the establishment in comics gives way to the
symbolisms activated by its absence.]]></content:encoded>

Je Me Souviendrai[/caption]

	I have been dreading this post for weeks now. I didn’t have a clue what
to write about colour. I don’t know why but it seemed like the biggest
possible challenge. I spent hours gazing wistfully at my bookshelves hoping
that one of my books would jump from the shelf, flap its pages a bit and
scream gleefully “Look at me, look at how interestingly colourful I am, write
about MEEEEEE”. Needless to say this didn’t happen so I just looked wistful
some more and felt a bit gloomy and wondered whether a large Gin and Tonic
might help.

	But then, as I sat here working on a paper for an upcoming conference I
started to write a little about a comic’s limited colour palette and slowly
but surely I put two and two together and had a hazy recollection that I was
supposed to be writing about something similar for something else. Finally I
realized that not only was I currently writing about a comic with a really
interesting and effective use of colour. But also that 90% of the times I had
been complaining of not knowing what to write about, and sitting wistfully
gazing, I had had this comic in my hands or on my lap. So now I think that I
am probably chronically under-caffeinated and really quite dopey (this would
also hopefully explain my terrible performance in recent games of Heads Up,
for example not knowing what Porky Pig’s surname is!).

	Now that that entirely unnecessary but illuminating preamble is out of
the way, I am going to forge onwards to my discussion of the use of a rather
limited palette in the comics, poetry and essay anthology <i>Je Me
Souviendrai</i>, published in August 2012 as a response to the events of the
so-called <a
href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/02/quebec-
student-protest-canada" target="_blank">Maple Spring </a>in Quebec. The Maple
Spring refers to events that occurred in Quebec between the March and June of
2012 in response to government plans to raise tuition fees by 75% over the
following 6 years.

	To demonstrate their support and solidarity for student protests, many
wore a small square of red felt and it is this that proved the inspiration
for the colour palette of <i>Je Me Souviendrai</i>. Artists use only shades
of black, grey, white and red in their comics and the result is
extraordinarily effective. The anthology contains a brief history of events,
spread throughout the text, poems that also use colour in their construction,
essays, plays, comics and full pages of art.  (I have just realized that
having said in my post about Nelson that I could get frustrated by the
reality of anthologies, here I am talking about them two posts in a row. I
don’t even recognize myself anymore.)

	However, this is a blog about comics and so it is the comics I shall
focus upon in this here ramble through my thoughts on colour. Some artists
featured in this book, such as Julie Delporte, choose to simply tinge their
art with a hint of red, an act that lends a lovely softness to some images.
Given that Delporte's work is done in bright crayons, this effect is
particularly striking if you are familiar with her work.  The overwhelming
feeling behind Delporte’s entries are of the hope and possibility that she
feels is encouraged by these manifestations of student solidarity and
political action and the choice of a soft, dusky reddish grey for her artwork
further encourages this idea.

	However in other cases it serves to underline the menace and suspicion
felt by many involved in the protests. Antoine Corriveau’s sketchy line
drawings reflect on his own experiences during the strikes and he also takes
the time to reflect on the political situation more generally. In those
panels in which Antoine expresses concern or worry about a particular event
or the state of politics, his cross hatching becomes tinged with a reddish
hue, for example the panel in which he depicts the arrest of Amir Khadir.

	Many of the artists make direct reference to the tradition of the red
squares in their pictures and comics. In one the artist Genevieve
Lafleur-Laplante draws a giant piece of red felt being cut into large squares
that are used as capes with which people fly away.  In another single page
image Melissa Tremblay depicts a young boy folding squares of red paper into
paper cranes that fly away. Much like in Delporte’s comics the student
movement depicted here is one of hope and possibility.

	Other comics show more innovative use of colour and the device of the red
squares, examples such as Chantale Boudreau’s single page which uses several
red squares (complete with drawn safety pins at the top) to form the panels
in which she tells part of her story. Meanwhile elsewhere, black and white
drawings are splattered with red paint or bloody handprints. Philippe
Girard’s offering introduces the reader to the superhero Passionrougeman, a
becaped superhero with an oversized red square on his chest. In this short
story Passionrougeman manages to seduce an uncertain government minister and
with his kiss she becomes imbued with the “Red Force” which allows her not to
be ashamed of showing her true colours.

	Some of the creators featured in this book decided to include the colour
brief as part of their story, others chose to highlight particular details by
colouring it in red and others chose to impose the red over the top of their
near finished pieces of art, as in the case of those photographs that have
been tinted red or the comics that have bloody handprints over them.
Regardless of the different ways in which the colour is used, what it does do
is create a coherent whole of this anthology and link together these
different approaches to the events of the Maple Spring. <i>Je Me
Souviendrai</i> is an impressive achievement, not only for the short time in
which it was conceived and produced, but also for the way in which it
demonstrates that comics can be used as an effective, creative and innovative
way in which to artistically respond to political events alongside more
widely accepted literary forms and that they can more than hold their own in
the process. By restricting the colour palette of those creators involved in
the book, the editors made a brave choice that challenged the creators
further but also created a greater and  more engaging whole as a
result.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A few
weeks ago Peter <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/02/18/155-color-in-comics-the-case-
of-matt-kindt/" target="_blank">wrote</a> about how when he was a
child “reading American comics from Marvel (mostly) and DC, I took colour for
granted”. Scott also <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/03/10/158-personalizing-reader-
engagement-colouring-in-comics/" target="_blank">noted</a> how colour was the
default for comics “colour is a subject that was rarely explored or even
acknowledged in comics in their earliest days – colour was simply a given,
with a palette of four colours used in various lackluster combinations as a
standard.” David <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/02/26/155-if-its-colour-its-crap-of
-palettes-and-establishments/" target="_blank">questioned</a> what this
default option meant when it was removed “It’s an odd juxtaposition that for
comics - and a lot of other things - a lack of colour makes what is often
thought of as a disposable commodity into Art. The thing about colour is that
it makes comics cheap and mainstream. A lack of colour on the other hand,
makes comics “underground,” “independent,” “adult,” “intellectual,” and all
the other superlatives that we toss around when we want to call comics an
artform.”</p> <p dir="ltr">What is interesting about these observations is
how much they are a North American perspective on comics. Growing up here in
the UK, comics were black and white, and printed on the cheapest of cheap
newsprint. The covers, which would often be the only source of colour, were
printed on the same paper, no glossy covering to protect the fragile insides
like the comics from the US that Peter, David and Scott grew up with in
Canada. I was also intrigued by Peter’s reaction to discovering some UK
editions of Marvel comics when he was a teenager in the 1970s.</p>

I picked up some Marvel comics on a family trip to the UK. I was stunned to
discover that they were not only in a different format - short and wide - but
also that they were in black and white. In <em>The Avenger</em>s, it was
strange to see <em>Captain America</em>, not in his red, white, and blue, but
in mere outline. At the time I was disconcerted, I couldn’t figure out
whether I had been ripped off, or whether it was kind of neat to have comics
presented to me in this new (to me) form.”</p> <p dir="ltr">Marvel UK had the
job of reformatting these US strips for the British market who expected black
and white as a default, at least in the ‘70s and ‘80s. Here in the UK four
colour printing was kept for the cover and centre page spread. <em>Dennis the
Menace</em> and the <em>Bash Street Kids</em> were colour but <em>Beryl the
Peril</em> and <em>Little Plum</em> were monochrome or sometimes two colour
(usually red). Incidentally Dundee Council have just named a street Bash
Street and it now has the UK’s only street sign with cartoon characters, at
least deliberately!</p>

<em>Hulk Comic</em>, which I must have picked up because I was a huge fan of
the Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno starring TV show. To me it wasn’t strange
that these comics were devoid of colour, that’s what comics looked like! I
actually read <em>Tintin</em> and <em>Asterix</em> (in full colour) as well,
often sitting in the library for hours poring over them, but they were
different from the weekly comics I read, they were proper books! The back up
strips in these Marvel UK comics were created by British talent and they
sometimes used these lack-of-colour limitations very well.  The pages that
stick in my head were of <em>Night Raven</em> drawn by David Lloyd. I
remember the atmospheric artwork with its thick blacks which was made to
printed in monochrome. Lloyd later drew <em>V for Vendetta</em>, another work
with strong use of chiaroscuro which was eventually coloured (some would say
ruined) for the American market. For more info on Marvel UK see Dez Skinn's

<p dir="ltr">As a teenager I read <em>2000AD</em> which was printed in black
and white like any other comic, apart from the cover and centre spread
usually reserved for their star character <em>Judge Dredd</em>. In the 1980s
printing technology had advanced to make colour printing more affordable and
<em>2000AD</em> slowly transformed into the glossy full colour magazine that
it is today, although I flicked through a copy last week and they still print
some strips in black and white.</p> <p dir="ltr">In the late 1980s
<em>2000AD</em> creators Steve Dillon and Brett Ewins put out <em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_(magazine)"
target="_blank">Deadline</a></em>, a black and white 'comics and lifestyle’
magazine that covered the indie music scene as well comics. There was a
crossover too, William Potter was the bass player in <a
href="http://www.williampotter.com/cudband/" target="_blank">CUD</a> and
produced the strip <em>Nommo</em> in Deadline. Many of the creators were from
the burgeoning small press scene such as Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett. Their
strip <em>Tank Girl</em> would soon become a worldwide sensation. Initially
attracted by the pizzazz of<em> Tank Girl</em> I soon came to prefer the less
sensational strips such as <em>Hugo Tate</em> by Nick Abadzis. Initially the
story of a stick man, the story gradually fleshed him out into a realistic
person. It has recently been reissued by <a
href="http://www.blankslatebooks.co.uk/our-books/hugo-tate/"
target="_blank">Blank Slate</a> and is highly recommended.</p>

dir="ltr">Another Deadline strip crying out for a reissue is Phillip Bond’s
<em>Wired World</em>. The strip was often likened to Jaime Hernandez’ Locas
strips in<em> Love &amp; Rockets</em> as it had two multicultural female lead
characters Pippa and Elizabeth, a rarity in comics at the time (still?). It
also had a surreal edge similar to early L&amp;R stories, such as in the
first issue when Malcolm McLaren wants to make them popstars but they
discover he (and several clones of him) are actually unfashionable aliens out
to steal their clothes. Please somebody reissue this!</p>

dir="ltr">Unlike readers raised on US comics, these black and white strips
have been my default and have no doubt influenced my comics reading
throughout my whole life. I’m not against colour but unlike Eddie Campbell I
wasn’t captivated by ‘strange and wonderful’ American comics, and unlike
David I don’t necessarily see colour ‘as a metaphor for the establishment’.
In the UK the establishment was black and white (and read all over).</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>C</strong>oulton Waugh’s <em>The
Comics</em> (1947) is perhaps the most influential history of comics to date.
This landmark work is one of the most-cited histories of comics and seems to
be responsible for many of the assumptions that underwrite the majority of
the common historical sense of what comics are and where they come from. In
his book, Waugh claims that when Outcault’s “The Great Dog Show in M’Googan
Avenue” appeared in the New York<em> World</em> on 16 February 1896, “a new
form of communication was about to be built” (Walker 2004:12).

	It is possible the cartoon work of Rodolphe Töpffer's (1799-1846) had not
had too much visibility in the United States, but the American <em>Puck</em>
Magazine (1871-1918) had been publishing colour cartoons since the 1890s, and
the work of cartoonists such as Frederick Burr Opper (1857-1937) already
reveals the existence of graphic narratives told in more than one panel.

	Opper’s "A Real English Outfit in America" is dated 1893, three years
before Waugh's proposed birth date for comics. In this page, a story is told
in sequential, unframed black and white page panels adapted to the shape of
the magazine's page. The text and the graphic images share space on the page
and although no caption boxes or dialogue balloons are used, each element is
simultaneously recognised as different yet belonging to the same textual
unit.

	[caption id="attachment_3603" align="alignnone" width="299"]<img

English-Outfit-in-America-1893.png" width="299" height="503" /> Opper’s "A
Real English Outfit in America" 1893. Courtesy of the Early Comics

	Waugh supports his claim that Outcault's strip should be considered the
first example of modern comics due to the nearly accidental use of a
faster-drying yellow ink on the trademark nightgown worn by "The Yellow Kid"
(as the series would become internationally known thereafter) and the
popularity that the new bright hue brought to the character and to the
newspaper that hosted it. Outcault’s character had appeared for the fist time
almost two years before the incident, on June 2, 1894, but it was until
colour was added to the series that, according to Waugh and his followers,
comics were born. [This view seems frankly US-centric; thanks to Alexi Conman
for referring to <a
href="http://www.imageandnarrative.be/inarchive/graphicnovel/rogersabin.htm"
title="http://www.imageandnarrative.be/inarchive/graphicnovel/rogersabin.htm"
target="_blank">this 2003 article</a> by Roger Sabin on Ally Sloper].

	However, Walker argues that “almost every aspect of Waugh’s tale is a
myth” (2004: 7). He explains that in September 1892, The <a
href="http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&BBID=11295012&v3=
1"
title="http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&BBID=11295012&v3
=1" target="_blank">Chicago<em> Inter-Ocean</em></a> was the first American
newspaper to use a high-speed rotary press, almost four years before Charles
Saalburg, who was described by Waugh as the “foreman of the New York<em>
World</em>’s tint-laying Ben Day machines” (Walker 2004:7), decided to
experiment on the Kid’s nightshirt with yellow pigment.

	It was from 1893 that the<em> Inter-Ocean</em> would start publishing its
first colour comics as small inserts, and by the spring of 1894 the Chicago
newspaper had introduced a weekly supplement for children titled the
<em>Inter-Ocean Jr</em>, and Saalburg himself was responsible for the cover
comics series known as The Ting Ling Kids. Furthermore, Walker corrects Waugh
and reveals that by 1896 Saalburg “was working for the <em>World</em> as a
cartoonist and art director –not as a press foreman.” (2004:7).

	What is important here is Walker’s claim that an American newspaper was
already publishing colour comics as early as 1893, three years before
Outcault’s series would reach fame as “The Yellow Kid”, and after the
publication of Waugh’s history in 1947, as the official grandfather of (at
least) American comics. What seems at least verifiable is that the first
appearance of Outcault’s character in the New York <em>World</em> took place
on 17 February 1895, as a black and white reprint of a cartoon originally
published in<em> Truth</em> magazine (Outcault had started publishing his
cartoons featuring the notorious character in said publication in 2 June
1894). The first colour episode appeared on 5 May 1895, and according to
Walker the Kid’s nightshirt in it was blue. Walker testifies that the
nightshirt was yellow on 24 November 1895, and red with black polka dots on
15 December 1895, before turning yellow permanently on 5 January 1896.

	Waugh appears to have had his dates wrong, and to have built a whole
thesis on a false premise. It is interesting that despite this, Waugh’s book
inheritance has been an unavoidable and ubiquitous one: it is taken as an
accepted truth that "The Yellow Kid" (which was not even the actual title of
the cartoon) was the starting point of American comics because of its
(apparently accidental) use of the yellow colour on a “February day of 1896”.

	Contrary to this opinion, Walker suggests that Outcault’s cartoon series,
<em>Hogan’s Alley</em>, which featured the Yellow Kid, did not introduce the
discursive resources or elements that are traditionally understood to
synthetise the common minimal elements of comics. Walker points out that
Outcault was not the first to use speech balloons, sequential narrative,
colour printing, recurring characters, adaptation to other media and product
licensing in the form of merchandising. Walker rightly asks: “then why is the
Yellow Kid universally regarded as the poster boy for the birth of the
comics?” He replies: “The answer lies in the long evolution of the art form
and the ultimate convergence of numerous historical trends” (2004: 8).

	Walker’s answer is not at all discordant with Walter Benjamin's
conception of the historicity of the work of art. Richard Fenton Outcault
happened to be in the right place at the right time: this does not mean that
his Yellow Kid originated the modern conception of comics. In the words of
Harvey,

	<blockquote>"The Yellow Kid wasn't the first comic strip, American or
otherwise [...] However, [it] was the first comics character to demonstrate,
beyond all question or quibble, the enormous appeal of the comics. Readers
doted on the funnies. So the comics sold newspapers. That phenomenon gave the
medium a future because it gave comics a mercantile basis" (Harvey
1998:17).</blockquote>

	Harvey's conclusion is important because "the non-original origin" of
comics is not attributed to either the creation of a new system of
signification with a specific vocabulary (panels in sequence, speech
balloons, etc.) or to the printing press and industrialised mechanical
reproduction. For Harvey, "The Yellow Kid"... "gave the medium a future"
because Outcault's creation had a readership, and because those readers paid
for it, and in so doing they were also sponsoring the integral phenomenon of
newspaper journalism.

	The particular setting of late 19th century and early 20th century
capitalism allowed the birth of a popular art form that would only be
paralleled and eventually succeeded in its mass appeal by film and
television. Different technological, cultural, economic and artistic factors
were involved in the creation of a new form of graphic communication,
resulting from the convergence of industrial development in the form of
radical transformations in printing and distribution techniques and also from
concordant changes in artistic trends and semiotic codes employed at the
time.

	Comics, or “the comics” as they were known as at first, were born at the
very centre of these turbulent times between 1870 and 1900, practically
giving a physiognomy to the end of the 19th century and opening the door
towards the century to come. The invention of the defining structural
elements of the comic strip were the result of technical conditions of
production during these technologically-turbulent years, and of the artists'
and publishers' experimentation with the resources they had access to.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I’m going to focus on contemporary cartoonists in this post, I’m
grateful to be following <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/04/01/161-the-yellow-kid-and-the-
non-original-origin/">Ernesto’s piece</a> about <i>The Yellow Kid </i>and
colour’s part in the debate surrounding the origins of the form, as its
conclusion reminds us of the importance of the “technical conditions of
production” which facilitate the creation of a comic. These conditions may or
may not facilitate the use of colour, or the use of colour in specific ways
for certain reasons, such as Alison Bechdel’s choices of limited palettes. In
<i>Fun Home</i>, the sombre grey-green palette lends weight to the funereal
tone of the book, whilst in <i>Are You My Mother </i>the washes of crimson
emphasise the importance of, and inescapable nature of, blood ties. When
asked about the colour choices <a
href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/bechdel-hatches-another-memoir/"
>in interviews</a>, Bechdel has stated that the books were conceived as using
only one colour for technical reasons – a condition of production with which
she has worked to create comics which use colour to specific ends and with
success. But a condition nonetheless, and therefore a constraint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Fun-Home_217.jpg"><
img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3630" alt="Bechdel i-vi,1-234F"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Fun-Home_217.jpg"
width="1628" height="2296" /></a></p> <p>Alison Bechdel, <i>Fun Home</i>.</p>
<p>Bechdel is a lone cartoonist, as are a notable majority of the successful
creators of alternative comics, a term I use here to provide a distinction
between it and the mainstream still somewhat dominated by Marvel and DC,
following the theories of Charles Hatfield in <i>Alternative Comics </i>and
Douglas Wolk in <i>Reading Comics: How Graphic Novels Work and What They
Mean</i>. Wolk sets out a dichotomy between “mainstream comics” and “art
comics,” which he writes “privilege the distinctiveness of the creator’s
hand, rather than the pleasures of the tools of genre and readerly
expectation.” This auteurism in alternative comics also neatly follows <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/02/26/155-if-its-colour-its-crap-of
-palettes-and-establishments/">Dave’s post</a> on colour as a metaphor for
the establishment. More often than not we associate colour in comics with the
cheap, mass-produced comics churned out by the mainstream, produced to
deadlines by a team of as many as six or seven people, in contrast to the
monochromatic graphic novels produced (in most cases) by a sole auteur which
have found acceptance and legitimation and helped to elevate the art form of
comics culturally. So it seems there is an expectation that alternative
cartoonists, working alone, will work and black and white and that their work
will thus carry cultural weight and be intellectual. However, alternative
cartoonists do often work in colour or aspire to in spite of the constraints
imposed upon them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Meredith Gran recently set up <a
href="http://www.patreon.com/octopuspie">a page on Patreon</a>, a
crowdfunding site which differs from the traditional models of Kickstarter et
al in that it asks for funding on an ongoing basis, either per month or per
creation. In Gran’s case, patrons (including myself) can choose to pay $1, $2
or $5 a month to support her in drawing her ongoing webcomic <a
href="http://www.octopuspie.com"><i>Octopus Pie</i></a>, which has been
running on and off since 2007 with the vast majority of its comics utilizing
a monochromatic palette and halftone patterns in place of full colour.
Patreon also offers “milestone goals” – when the creator reaches a certain
monthly amount, a reward can be offered to the patrons. Gran has already
passed $1,000 a month, after which the reward is that she can now use the
money from Patreon to pay her health insurance, and is up to around $1,500 a
month. What’s interesting is that her $3,000 milestone offering reads “if we
go this high, I will start posting Octopus Pie pages, 3 times a week, in FULL
COLOUR – for the first time ever. Can you imagine? I can’t…just yet.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/octopus-pie-525x339.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3631"

src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/octopus-pie-525x339.
jpg" width="525" height="339" /></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Meredith Gran,
<i>Octopus Pie</i></p> <p>This, I think, is a neat encapsulation of how
alternative comics deal with colour – as a slightly mystical thing, to be
used if and when the cartoonist can afford to and/or wants to in order to
realise their creative vision. The implication in this milestone goal is
that, if Gran were given enough money to be able to concentrate solely on
<i>Octopus Pie</i> (which, we understand from this, has not been the case
thus far) she would choose to work in full colour. What can also be read from
this is that working without colour has been largely the result of technical
conditions and constraints, but this does not mean that working in black and
white has been a lesser process or produced lesser works. Gran has had
success working in black and white, but it seems that working in colour has
always been something to be aspired to for her. The reason for this are
perhaps the subject for another post, but it could be because colour would
allow for greater verisimilitude in representation and would add another tool
to help her realise the vision she has for characters and their stories,
another level of narrative to be used in bringing her version of Brooklyn to
life. As a long-time reader and fan, I’ve enjoyed the <a
href="http://www.octopuspie.com/2009-05-15/289-liberty-interlude/">occasional
forays</a> Gran has made into colour, and I hope she reaches the goal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So colour can be aspired to by alternative cartoonists
without it immediately or fully carrying the establishment associations set
out by Dave in his post, though this does not mean they are easy to escape.
However, we can see from Meredith Gran’s example that there are cases where
the lack of colour has been, at least in part if not fully, the result of
technical and economic constraints rather than a conscious aesthetic and
political choice.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The recent colour reissues of the
<i>Scott Pilgrim </i>series, along with Bryan Lee O’Malley’s forthcoming
standalone graphic novel <i>Seconds</i>, are also interesting in their use of
colour. The original <i>Scott Pilgrim </i>comics were created by O’Malley
alone, working as a relatively financially unstable author for the
independent Oni Press. He has documented his processes and his career on his
Tumblr – <a
href="http://radiomaru.tumblr.com/post/19636786709/hi-i-wanted-to-know-how-
did-you-first-break-into-the">in a post responding to a question</a> about
“breaking in” to comics, he revealed that he got $1,500 up front for the
first Scott Pilgrim book, which took him 6-8 months to write and draw, during
which time he worked in a restaurant when the money ran out. Under these
conditions it would be incredibly hard work for a lone cartoonist to produce
a black and white comic, and impossible to produce one in full colour. As
such, it’s unlikely colour was ever even a consideration for O’Malley when
conceiving his <i>Scott Pilgrim </i>series.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SPV1-HC-PG-010-FNL.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3632"
alt="SPV1-HC-PG-010-FNL"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SPV1-HC-PG-010-FNL.
jpg" width="938" height="1388" /></a></p> <p>Bryan Lee O’Malley, <i>Scott
Pilgrim’s Precious Little Life (Colour Edition)</i></p> <p>However, since the
<i>Scott Pilgrim </i>series finished and O’Malley found commercial success
(thanks to the series’ exponential growth in popularity and the film
adaptation), Oni Press have begun publishing colour editions. These editions
are not coloured by O’Malley himself, but instead are coloured by Nathan
Fairbarn, who has also coloured <i>Seconds. </i>O’Malley has also given over
lettering duties for <i>Seconds </i>to Dustin Harbin, moving the book’s
production into a model closer to the mainstream production line than the
traditional lone cartoonist toiling in obscurity and financial ruin.
<i>Seconds </i>will be in full colour on its initial release, and this is
precisely because O’Malley and Oni Press now have the facility to do this
because their economic circumstances have changed to allow for this and their
conditions of production have expanded.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Some alternative
cartoonists and their works still wouldn’t make sense in colour, of course –
as Dave points out, it’s impossible to imagine <i>Maus</i> being an effective
work in full colour. However, cartoonists must always work with significant
constraints which don’t always allow for colour to be a consideration, or
more than an aspiration that may or may not be reached some day in the future
of their work. If this day does dawn for them, as it has done for Bryan Lee
O’Malley, some will choose to work in colour and some won’t, for various
reasons, many of which will be related to associations created by colour’s
history within the form. Colour has a rich history within the form and can be
used in myriad ways to myriad ends, but it must be facilitated by the
conditions of the comic’s production first.</p>

		<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p
		dir="ltr">The first thing I thought of when I started reading Ed
		Piskor's <em>Hip Hop Family Tree</em> was Jonathan Lethem's coming of
		age novel, <em>The Fortress of Solitude</em>, a novel with which I
		felt a keen identification, even though its overlap with my life was
		limited to a few cultural references and the fact that it took place
		in the mid to late 1970s when I was growing up. In Lethem's novel,
		Dylan Ebdus is a white kid growing up in the predominantly black
		neighborhood of Gowanus in Brooklyn. The neighborhood is gentrifying
		but, at this point, not too quickly. Dylan's best friend is Mingus
		Rude, a mixed race kid whose father is a coke-addled, semi-famous
		r&amp;b singer. The two boys share a similar familial situation--each
		is the only child of a single father--and a love of comics. Fortress
		of Solitude also refers to the rise of hip hop: "It would be the
		throwdown of the summer of '77 though it was still the start of July:
		Grandmaster DJ Flowers is coming with his crew from Flatbush to spin
		discs in the schoolyard of P.S. 38 after the block party on Bergen"
		(163). Somehow, I recognized this moment even though I would have had
		no knowledge of it in 1977. It was like nostalgia for something that
		I had never experienced.</p> <p dir="ltr">The familiarity of the
		references in Lethem's novel--Sugar Hill Records, Rapper’s
		Delight--is perhaps due to a retrospective reconstruction of personal
		history through barely conscious cultural associations. The
		phenomenon is perhaps analogous to that where more people claimed to
		have been at the Sex Pistols’ <a
		href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/14/sex-pistols-lesser
		-free-hall">1976 show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade</a> Hall
		than could possibly have been in the audience.  I read a lot of pop
		music publications in my young adulthood, and even though my
		interests lay in the direction of UK punk and New Wave, something
		about this parallel movement in the US must have seeped into my
		consciousness. Punk and hip hop rose around the same time but tended
		to exist in separate realms, in spite of efforts by the Clash and
		Blondie to put them together, which Piskor documents in his book.</p>
		<p dir="ltr"><a
		href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/photo-1.png"
		><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3670" alt="photo (1)"
		src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/photo-1.png"
		width="763" height="558" /></a></p> <p dir="ltr">When I look back, it
		seems to me now that where Punk was in many ways conservative and
		retrogressive (though excitingly so!), hip hop was avant garde and
		revolutionary. In Fortress of Solitude, three white punks laugh when
		they hear "Rapper's Delight," but their laughter is that of people
		who are behind the curve. They don't know that they are listening to
		the future.</p> <p dir="ltr"><a
		href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-23-
		20.57.55.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3664"
		alt="2014-04-23 20.57.55"
		src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-23-20
		.57.55.png" width="740" height="741" /></a></p> <p dir="ltr">Piskor's
		<em>Hip Hop Family Tree</em> is a comic book history--incorporating
		panels of future hip hop stars reading X-men to legitimate the
		connection-- that gives concrete details to the vague recognition of
		the genre’s beginnings people like me hold. Representing a musical,
		aural phenomenon in pictures and writing works surprisingly well. In
		fact, Piskor’s intentional use of a 1970’s pulp comic look has a
		transporting effect. Far from being a gimmick, it signifies a
		particular time and place that reminds us how important the visual
		aspect of the movement was. Piskor says that the urban landscapes of
		1970s comics were a particular link between comics and hip hop.
		Marvel comics of this period in particular featured a gritty New
		York. And it seems perfectly likely that such a comic book
		environment should have spawned such mythological figures as
		Grandmaster Flash, Kool Herc, and Kurtis Blow. By creating alter-ego
		identities for themselves and battling each other, the early rappers
		created stories and aesthetics that reconfigured their reality.
		Afrika Bambaataa, a powerful gang leader, turned his crew to
		non-violent “battles” of breakdance, beats, and rapping.</p> <p
		dir="ltr"><a
		href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-23-
		20.57.25.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3663"
		alt="2014-04-23 20.57.25"
		src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-23-20
		.57.25.png" width="451" height="339" /></a></p> <p dir="ltr">And so
		an urban reality became art: dance, music, and painting. Graffiti
		artists like Fab Five Freddy and Jean Basquiat were integral parts of
		what was truly a multimodal movement that deserves a multimodal
		history.</p> <p dir="ltr"><a
		href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-23-
		20.59.02.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3665"
		alt="2014-04-23 20.59.02"
		src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-23-20
		.59.02.png" width="1001" height="480" /></a></p> <p dir="ltr">What’s
		neat about Hip Hop Family Tree is the way Piskor puts all these
		pieces together. There are many significant characters here, and they
		frequently touch each other only tangentially. Piskor does great work
		to make this the story of a scene rather than of a particular
		individual, though Russell Simmons, the managerial mastermind behind
		Kurtis Blow, Run DMC and Def Jam, stands out. The name of the comic
		tells us everything we need to know about its structure: a family
		tree is a multimodal visual system like a comic that helps us
		remember who everyone is by showing them in a particular spatial
		configuration. Consequently, Piskor constructs Hip Hop Family Tree
		more as a series of visual tableaux, somewhat like flash cards, than
		as strictly sequential panels that tell a forward-moving narrative.
		In no way does this presentation diminish Piskor's project, which is
		to fix the origins of hip hop in our memory. Hip Hop Family Tree is
		the first comic that I have read to present cultural history in this
		way, so I was struck by the freshness of Piskor's structural approach
		and the way he builds his representation of the scene.</p> <p
		dir="ltr">Piskor is especially good at portraying the difficulties of
		translating hip hop into the world of conventional pop music
		recording. DJs like Grandmaster Flash used other people’s records in
		their shows which he couldn’t put on his own records. So the first
		disc Grandmaster Flash put out did not actually feature him at
		all.</p> <p dir="ltr"><a
		href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-23-
		21.08.58.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3669"
		alt="2014-04-23 21.08.58"
		src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-23-21
		.08.58.png" width="752" height="743" /></a></p> <p dir="ltr">Thus
		Piskor shows how integrating hip hop with the record industry meant
		the rise of the MC or rapper, initially an add-on to the DJ’s show,
		and the diminishment of the DJ. Rather than simply being a love
		letter to hip hop, Piskor’s comic strikes me as a legitimate history
		that charts the subtleties of its transformation. Hip Hop Family Tree
		 is a tonic to the notion that comics simplify, in a bad way, what
		they represent.</p> <p dir="ltr">Ultimately, <em>Hip Hop Family
		Tree</em> made me understand what I identified with in Lethem's
		<em>The Fortress of Solitude</em>: the extent to which my memory
		depends on my mediated experience of the popular American
		pop-cultural forms of the 1970s. It took me a while to bite the
		bullet and buy Hip Hop Family tree because I didn't think it was "for
		me," but it turned out to be the opposite. This is a book for anyone
		who interested in a detailed history of an incredibly creative period
		and the larger than life geniuses who made it that way.</p> <p

		<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nope, yr junk.
		Plain and simple.

	I, for one, am all for the margins. And not the margins that reflect a
deep immersion in the histories, narratives, and mythology of comics and
their production, but the margins that seek to impose themselves on the
rigid, contrived, penis-oriented nerd-centred hierarchies of comics
histories, narratives, and mythologies. I’m interested in the margins that
seek to provoke, up-end, insult the integrity of the burgeoning comics canon.

	To this end, I’ve been getting antsy about what I see as an increasing
shift in comics toward the mainstream, especially in the academy.
Intellectual conversations around comics are circulating widely through the
hallways, onto introductory course syllabi, and comics scholarship is right
out there with other trendy approaches like digital humanities. We’re all
busily finding a place for comics in the cultural conversation, seeking to
justify, explain, generally demystify what we see as an art form.

	Comics “scholars” (as if that isn’t the grandest of oxymorons–right up
there with Heavy Metal scholars and sociologists) would do well to remember
Joe Strummer: “Authority is supposedly grounded in wisdom, but I could see
from a very early age that authority was only a system of control and it
didn’t have any inherent wisdom. I quickly realized that you either became a
power or you were crushed.” Or, if you prefer a notable quotable closer to
home, how about Walt Kelly, through Pogo: “We have met the enemy and he is
us.”

	Whenever I get antsy about anything, I return to punk music. The music
itself, and the philosophy behind it. The title of this missive comes from a
newspaper headline in which “punks” were upset that they had been unduly
picked upon by police for inciting a riot. It’s an old headline and notable
only because I raged about it at the time. I raged because the whole
principle of being punk is that you are junk–that’s your only power. You
reject acceptance in favour of the margins. You support only chaos and
loudness. You break consciously away from anything that might suggest
legitimacy. Above all, you don’t whine about being junk–you relish it.

	Comics and the conversations around them would do well to be conscious of
the medium’s parallel trajectory to music, particularly music on the margins.
I don’t think comics relish their disposability anymore, and I think the
academic conversations around comics and their increasing visibility in
academic contexts has something to do with this sense of permanence creeping
into comics production. Everyday it seems there’s a new comic that represents
our current cultural situation better than ever–that stands as a marker for
who we are and where we might be going–like Sex Criminals, say. My point is
this: is anyone just reading comics anymore? Or have they been permanently
remediated as a valuable form of cultural production.

	There’s all sorts of similar narratives trajectories in music: rap /
gansta rap / rock’n’roll / punk / emo / all onceoccupied the margins,
represented the margins, but now seem a permanent fixture in the cultural
conversation–when yr mother is singing Jay-Z, is it really cultural
critique–was it ever–does that matter? I don’t think comics should concern
themselves with their viability. I think comics should be disposable, and we
would do well to treat them as such. They can have value as something
disposable–they always have. The difference is that returning to a disposable
comics culture would bring things more in line with that other casualty of
the digital age: the mixed tape.

	http://youtu.be/zu1V3R-Jpwo

	The exchange among peers of cassette tapes, with their scrawled ledgers
listing tunes has disappeared into the regulated and formalized world of Rdio
playlists, iTunes geniuses, and the like. Getting a friend’s mixed tape was a
way of connecting, and disconnecting, from the community; we didn’t have to
like it, we didn’t have to commit, we could damn well throw it out.
Unfortunately, we’re far too busy making our own mixed tapes and not really
participating any longer in the politics of exchange and disposability that
makes comics–and good, emerging music–different, marginal. Comics and the
narratives around them have turned all Prog. Rock: King Crimson sweeping
narratives, endless in scope and twisting, turning in virtuoso performance
rather than catchy disposable summer hits we all remember. We’re all critique
and “genius” without any real sense of what the implications of such
discourses might be or the utter boredom of the ritual itself (what’s the
sound of 10,000 comicbook nerds wanking: a Rush concert).

	In closing, let’s crank it up; rev up the chainsaw and blow everything
we’re doing up. Let’s think less about justifying, close reading, and
establishing legitimacy or a canon and think more about a disposable making
mixed tapes that mark particular junctures in the life of a critical bell
curve. Let’s make sure that the critical conversations we have about comics
are as disposable and unnecessary as the medium itself. Stop shoving comics
where they don’t belong; you might ruin them. And most of all, stop whining
about how comics are not junk; they’re junk–that’s what makes them so fucking
awesome.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you remember that
scene in <em>Understanding Comics</em> where Scott McCloud is trying to
define comics, and he's up on stage and someone in the audience keeps calling
out names of superheroes until he is forcibly removed? And hahahahaha
[knowing glance to other "comics scholars" in the room] who was that idiot
anyway?

	I'm beginning to think I'm that idiot. <p style="text-align: left;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/understanding-
comics1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3693"
alt="understanding-comics1"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/understanding-comics1
.jpg" width="556" height="550" /></a>The definition that McCloud comes up
with here makes me want to punch myself in the face for two reasons. One, it
smacks of a desperate need to be taken seriously (juxtaposed pictorial and
other images ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?); and two, it means almost nothing
to me. Doesn't basically everything in the history of the world either convey
information or produce an aesthetic response? Especially if it can be either
a pictorial or "other" image? And who determines whether it's deliberate? I'm
pretty sure this definition covers everything I've ever seen with my
eyeballs.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">I'd rather hang out with the dude
who likes Batman and got kicked out of this imaginary conference than with
the people nodding sagely along with this non-definition. (And yes, I know
McCloud revisits this definition again in <em>Reinventing Comics</em> and
acknowledges some of the problems with it, but for now I'm talking about this
particular scene so bear with me.) I feel like when I got into comics, we
were all the Batman guys, and as the years pass and we grow up and we all
yearn to be taken seriously by the academy, we recognize that there's no
space for the Batman guy at the party anymore, and lest anyone figure out we
used to be like him, we turn on him and kick him out. Because LOL
SUPERHEROES, am I right?</p> <p style="text-align: left;">In my scholarly
life, I'm trying to assemble a comprehensive history of Canadian comics, and
even though the world of English-Canadian comics especially is basically a
massive anti-commercial indie hipster circle jerk at the moment, it wouldn't
exist at all without its own frivolous superheroic history of Johnny Canuck
and Nelvana of the North. These were largely terrible comics, but they were
where people learned how to comic, and those skills and that heritage weren't
lost; they just, in the words of the great Calvin and Hobbes,
transmogrified.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">Why so much anxiety about
this part of our collective history?</p> <p style="text-align: left;">I
prefer basically all the other definitions McCloud greys out there, but I
especially like number four: "Corruptor of Our Nation's Youth." At least that
gave us something interesting to rally around. I'd much rather devote my
professional life to studying the corruptor of our nation's youth than to
studying juxtaposed pictorial or other images in deliberate sequence.</p> <p
style="text-align: left;">We take ourselves too seriously at our peril.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I suppose I've imported the person I was/am as a
literary scholar to the world of comics: in my literary life, I study the
popular press and try to figure out why it is successful. I love pop. I love
bubble gum. I love comics. I guess this comes down to the fact that I am far
more interested in what is popular and why it's popular than I am in lofty
and worthy conversations about a medium that is supposed to be fun. Yeah,
that's right, I said it. I think comics should be fun. <em>Maus</em> is
tragic and heartbreaking, but it's also funny and
infuriating. <em>Tangles</em> is painful and difficult, but it's also
whimsical and lovely. I don't think we sell out the artistic or literary
merit of any comic to acknowledge that it's something more than a series of
juxtaposed pictorial or other images in deliberate sequence.</p> <p
style="text-align: left;">I don't care that some really dense people don't
take comics seriously. They probably also don't take television seriously;
that is equally dumb. <em>What people consume matters</em>. When we dismiss
any of it out of hand, we lose an opportunity to make a little more sense of
the world. Not an idealized corner of the world, but the actual media
landscape as it is really consumed by real people who spend their real money
on really content. Those are the people who matter to the future of comics,
way more than us ivory tower dorks, and we should pay attention to what they
read and like and are.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">To the extent that
this is my mini-manifesto, I will always be the one yelling, "What about
Batman!" in the rooms full of serious-minded comics scholars that grow ever
more crowded.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">You might ask, "Why aren't we
taken seriously?"</p> <p style="text-align: left;">I will respond, "What
about Batman!"</p> <p style="text-align: left;">You might ask, "How do we
establish Research Chairs in Comics Studies?"</p> <p style="text-align:
left;">I will respond, "What about Batman!"</p> <p style="text-align:
left;">You might ask, "Wasn't this post supposed to be about Comics and
Music?"</p> <p style="text-align: left;">I will respond, "Batman! Batman!
Batman!"</p> <p style="text-align: center;"></p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think you're missing the point.  If someone
wants a definition that will distinguish a comic from any other object (say,

an answer to the question "What is a comic?" that seems pretty on the

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The Batman joke is a self joke.

	The scene says about itself exactly as you interpreted it: try to
overthink something like comics makes you sound like a pretentious jerk. And
when someone tries something "the scholars" consider inferior, they dismiss
the dissident; perhaps not calling the guards, but maybe with something like
subtle or even aggressive scoffing.

	I'm guessing McCloud himself was scoffed like this many times and, when
he found himself on the position of the scholar, he simply joked about it, by
exaggerating as any of old school comic makers would approve. You say comics
should be fun? I found this bit pretty fun.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It seems the problem with the idiot in the room
is that he's trying to force superheroes into the definition of comics.
McCloud at the time was just part of a collective effort to root out the
cliché that "comics = superheroes".

	I don't feel that superhero stories are kept out of serious discussions
about comics, or particularly despised. In the Hooded Utilitarian's top 115
comics, admitedly a connoisseur's list, Lee &amp; Kirby's Fantastic Four is
10th and Dark Knight Returns is 18th, while Tintin is 15th and Tezuka's
Phoenix is 33rd. That feels pretty generous to me. Of course I'm French, so
superheroes don't have the same meaning to me, but what I mean is that
American scholars and hipster fans usually recognize the importance of
superhero comics in their love of the genre, and the real qualities of the
good ones.

	I understand that the definition is very broad and exceedingly arcane,
but that's because the important part is reaching that definition, by
including, one by one, all the forms comics can take, rather than letting
consensus limit its scope. That's what made the book great at the time.
Asking to add superheroes or fun in the definition wouldn't really take the
discussion in any meaningful direction.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'd say that seriousness about a medium also
grows out of a love and deep appreciation of said medium, though, and that it
warrants a certain (perhaps sometimes excessive) analysis. A discussion about
comics that focuses on "Batman! Batman! Batman!" doesn't really lead to much
except comic-book-store debates about which superhero could beat the Dark
Knight (and boy, have I ever been there!). :-)

	But isn't there also a little irony in writing a literary article about
how comics shouldn't be taken too seriously? Are similar discussions about
literature too serious?

	I think McCloud also was trying to define too many things as belonging to
the world of comics, that much is true, and his definition is probably too
vague to be all that useful on a practical level. However, I don't believe
that comics need to be fun. They certainly CAN be, and in many cases should
be, but many of the greatest comics are not fun per se; I don't know that I'd
call all that much of Alan Moore's work "fun" (Top Ten and such
notwithstanding), but V for Vendetta and Watchmen are some of my favourite
comics.

	Another point I'd like to mention is that those people who "really matter
to the future of comics" are in large part the people maintaining the status
quo of comics with regard to the representation of women and other minorities
in the medium. They're not, by and large, the ones interested in having
debates over heteronormativity in comics or pushing for the retirement of
tired tropes like the Women in the Refrigerator and such. Given that, I'd
argue that MORE room ought to be reserved for "ivory tower dorks" like
us.]]></wp:comment_content> <wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved>

 Your Juxtaposed Pictorial and Other Images in Deliberate Sequence and Shove

 ">completely correct</a> – we do tend to take ourselves far too seriously in
 the academy concerning our treatment of comics studies. As in any field,
 there is a tendency to create an ostracizing language that defines the
 discipline and marginalizes those who refuse to learn its complex
 vocabularies as we tend to fixate on the boutique, niche market, “literary”
 aspects (and titles) of the medium. We do this for a number of reasons, not
 the least of which being that our training in English literature forces us
 to do so – this is how we were brought up, so to speak, in classes devoted
 to continental literary theory, obscure poetry of undefined periods, and
 postcolonial studies attempting to recontextualize under-read texts. It is
 through these means that English scholars today, judging by the
 self-reflexive pieces consistently offered in PMLA (even in its most recent
 issue), are fixated on justifying the existence of the discipline as a whole
 even while stating that this is the opposite of what they are doing. It is
 little wonder that, in establishing comics as a relatively new field and
 offshoot of the larger canon, that we employ the same knee-jerk reactions
 that limit our engagement with more popular works. In order to be validated,
 there appears to be a need to have comics studies emulate its parent
 field.</p> <p class="MsoNormal"><a
 href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/P1070196.jpg"><img
 class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3701" alt="P1070196"
 src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/P1070196-224x300.jpg
 " width="224" height="300" /></a>In order to rethink this self-defeating
 paradigm, we have to address what drew us to comics as a field of study on
 its own in the first place – proliferation, popularity and entertainment. To
 do this, we might look at the way that the general public engages with the
 medium. Having recently attended an academic conference during the same week
 that I attended a comic book convention, FanExpo Vancouver, I couldn’t help
 but be overwhelmed by the vast differences in the audiences at each event.
 As well I should be, you might say, as they’re designed for different
 purposes, no? The academic conference is, ostensibly anyway, a gathering of
 individuals in celebration of their field, listening to panels of experts
 discussing recent trends and current research, meeting celebrated authors
 who will speak to the crowds, and then very likely a vendors’ section
 marketing products to attendees. Problem is, the academic conference is also
 work – the peripheral talk surrounds the decline of the discipline, the lack
 of positions for new PhDs, cuts to funding and the need to rethink
 traditions. And very few attendees are present without the benefit of a PD
 fund or other form of stipend that allows them to be there.</p> <p
 class="MsoNormal">It turns out that the purpose of the comic convention is
 very similar to the academic conference in terms of its <i
 style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">raison d’être</i>, though it is lacking
 a focus on the “professional” study of comics. The comic convention is not
 work at all – it celebrates the medium with a joyful revelry that is
 unbiased and unfettered by any concerns about the supposed decline of the
 Arts. Turn here to see all of the positive attributes that the academic
 conference is supposed to hold with none of its drawbacks or posturing.
 Celebrity panels of authors and illustrators are listened to with rapt
 attention and lively engagement, signings and photo ops are in abundance,
 new trends in comics’ publication are brought up for their positive
 potential and not in fear of the transitions that lay on the horizon.
 Lineups to attend, at least at FanExpo, are often hours long with enthusiasm
 never waning. Tickets, as with the academic conference, can be costly,
 though attendees do not begrudge paying them even though they are certainly
 not being funded by an institution. Ages range from the very young to the
 far <a
 href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/P10701881.jpg"><img
 class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3699" alt="P1070188"
 src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/P10701881.jpg"
 width="336" height="448" /></a>more seasoned fan, and it is difficult to
 imagine a more inclusive event.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">This enthusiasm is
 most evident in the costume roleplaying, or cosplay, that many fans
 participate in. Creation of these costumes is a detailed and time consuming
 process, with many of the audience members taking weeks or even months to
 mold and sculpt their favorite character’s suits in homage – some of those I
 interviewed when I attended stated that they dress up every year for the
 event. Some are flamboyant, others revealing, and others very understated so
 as to only catch the eye of other fans of a particular title. Like many
 other parents who attended with children, I dressed my one year old up for
 the occasion, first as Spider-Man then as Superman. The atmosphere around
 cosplayers and those taking photos of them was vibrant and exciting, with
 both viewer and viewed flaunting their love of comics through the process of
 recording the event in images. Not only is there joy in the attendance, but
 a sense of pride regarding their level of involvement.</p> <p
 class="MsoNormal"><a
 href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/P1070228.jpg"><img
 class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3700" alt="P1070228"
 src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/P1070228-224x300.jpg
 " width="224" height="300" /></a>Why is the convention so much more
 successful than the conference? Why is it filled with the elation that the
 academy should have but doesn’t? The short answer is that it doesn’t deny
 the public a reason to attend – invited guests and celebrities of the event
 are both popular and niche, with no limitations on which comic should be
 present. The artists’ alley houses many from the big two publishers, though
 they also include those who work entirely on zines and publish
 independently. Authors are similarly represented, including novelists as
 well as comics’ writers, with no one privileged over the other. The
 convention does not deny the reason that people engage with comics,
 sometimes – perhaps often – purely for entertainment’s sake. Instead, it
 revels in the success of the medium in every way possible.</p> <p
 class="MsoNormal"><a
 href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/P1070193.jpg"><img
 class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3702" alt="P1070193"
 src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/P1070193-300x224.jpg
 " width="300" height="224" /></a>Is this not what we should be doing with
 comics studies, and truly with the study of English on the whole? In my very
 first experience as a TA, I was begrudgingly tasked with teaching Harry
 Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone to a class of first year students. To
 this day, I have never seen a more engaged and proactive class, despite the
 objectives being exactly the same in every 100 level lit class I’ve taught
 since: critical thinking, close reading and discovering
 intertextuality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We can have none
 of these if we don’t foster engagement first. What would a conference look
 like if we did not deny the authors that the general populace actively
 enjoyed reading <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">en masse</i>? What
 if, instead, we turned to these authors <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
 normal;">first</i> in our study of the changing nature of the discipline?
 There is a tendency, and almost an expectation, to differentiate the study
 of literature from the reading of books, to define literature as something
 necessarily outside of the popular – many with whom I’ve spoken martyr
 themselves solely on Thackeray, Fielding or Joyce, and if they read Cussler,
 Clancy or King, they certainly don’t discuss it.</p> <p class="MsoNormal"><a
 href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/P1070207.jpg"><img
 class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3703" alt="P1070207"
 src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/P1070207-300x224.jpg
 " width="300" height="224" /></a>With comics, we have the potential to
 reinterpret the insular nature of the academic approach that often refuses
 to accept the popular often solely because it is popular. If we are to grow
 as a field, it will be through latching on to what inspires larger audiences
 and drives them to read, not by immediately excluding this potential because
 of the formulaic approaches to literature that have become so deeply
 ingrained that we often fail to notice them. The academy thrives best when
 it concentrates on what is relevant in an accessible and inviting manner.
 Posturing in comics studies will only serve to replicate the same anxieties
 that scholars of traditional literature feel today. While conferences may
 not mirror conventions in the near future, organizers clearly could find
 some inspiration in the success of this inclusivity. Writ larger, we need to
 be aware that applying the academic logic of limitation on a fledgling field
 of study will only serve to narrow the doorway for those who may wish to
 devote themselves to study the discipline in future generations. “Where is
 Batman?” is a question we should consistently be asking
 indeed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

 <description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

	I take my position on Graphixia as the resident <span
style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Quebec Comics
Monkey</em></span> rather seriously, so today I am going to take my chance to
give you a list of my top Québécois comics that I think you should go and
hunt down to read… right this very second if at all possible.

	&nbsp;

	I sometimes worry that I do Québécois comics an injustice. I often find
myself at conferences angling for the cheap laugh by drawing attention to
Quebec’s rip off of Asterix and Obelix (his name is Bojoual, it’s a little
bit racist and quite a lot rubbish), or making fun of the inimitable
Capitaine Kebec. Yet despite this I genuinely do think that some of the
Québécois comics I have read both for fun and whilst doing my research are
some of the most exciting, innovative or just plain lovely books I have ever
read.* I’m not going to include Julie Doucet and Guy Delisle on this list
because you’ve probably already read some of their books but I am going to
include some names I have spoken about previously on the site because I am a
woman obsessed.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	<strong>Jimmy Beaulieu – <em>Suddenly Something Happened</em></strong>

	&nbsp; <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Beaulieu is the founder of the
publishing house Mecanique Generale as well as a comic book artist and this
book is my favourite of all of his works. It tells the stories of how he came
from Rural Quebec to live and work in Montreal and is a beautiful musing in
living, working and loving in the city. His short section that focuses on the
balconies of Montreal made me so homesick for living there that I had to put
the book in the freezer and have a big cry.</p> &nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	<strong>Michel Rabagliati – <em>Paul Joins the Scouts</em></strong>

	&nbsp; <p style="padding-left: 30px;">I’ve spoken at length before about
just how wonderful Michel Rabagliati’s semi-autobiographical comics are. This
latest one in the series is no exception. On the surface a story about Paul’s
childhood adventures when he joins the Scouts, this is really a moving tale
of friendship, loss and the people that make an indelible impression on our
lives. Rabagliati’s books just keep getting better and better and I can’t
wait to see what happens next.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <a

href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MRPS.png"> </a></p>
<strong>Sylvain Lemay, Andre St Georges – <em>Pour en finir avec
novembre</em></strong>

	&nbsp; <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The story of four friends who are
inspired by the events of the October Crisis in 1970 and so they make a
series of choices that change their lives irrevocably. I thoroughly enjoyed
this attempt to address some of the most divisive events in Quebec’s history
in comic book form. Engaging and honestly written this is well worth checking
out if you can find it.</p> &nbsp;

	<strong>Simon Bossé et Eric Simon – <em>Hamidou Diop</em></strong>

	&nbsp; <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Hubert Aquin’s <i>Prochain
Episode</i> is one of my favourite books, of all time, ever, and this comic
which explores what happened to the enigmatic character of Hamidou Diop after
the novel ended is gloriously inventive and playful enough to do justice to
the original text. Single page panels give the story a brilliantly laid back
pace and the sparse artwork and explanatory text make this something between
a Comic and an Emblem Book. Unfortunately this hasn’t yet been translated
into English, but if you’re a fan of Aquin’s novel and can read French then
do seek it out.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ESHD.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3720" alt="ESHD"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ESHD.png" width="470"
height="661" /></a></p> <strong>Pascal Blanchet – <em>White
Rapids</em></strong>

	&nbsp; <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Pascal Blanchet’s books are just
downright beautiful. I wrote for this blog previously about how he uses music
to wonderful effect but right here I would like to focus on this book. White
Rapids tells the story of the northern Quebec town which was founded by the
Shawningen Water and Power company for their employees. Beautifully created
images perfectly convey the lives of its residents and their ultimate dismay
as the town is abruptly shut down in the 1970s. What are you even waiting
for? Go on… order it!</p> <a

	<strong>Luc Giard – <em>Le Pont du Havre</em></strong>

	&nbsp; <p style="padding-left: 30px;">I’ve read this book a few times now
and every time I reread it I come away having found something else to mull
over, I love this about it. Whilst it is most definitely a comic book, at
times it feels like you are reading a poem. While his artwork can seem
scratchy and sketchy at the beginning it bears a closer look and Giard uses
visual references to other artists and repetition to brilliant effect. As the
book draws to a close he begins to introduce colour to his panels and this
shift in visual tone works to unsettle the reader and cause them to rethink
their perception of the rest of the book.</p> &nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	So, there you go, six comics that I think you should read that you might
not have heard of. Let me know if you have read or do read any of them, I
would love to know what you think!

	&nbsp;

	<em>*For the purposes of clarity I have chosen works by artists from the
province of Quebec. The works were originally published in French. Most of
them are now available in English.</em>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A small
corner of the internet got very excited last week when writer Gabe Soria (<a
href="http://us.macmillan.com/lifesucks/JessicaAbel" target="_blank">Life
Sucks</a>) posted an entry titled ‘<a
href="http://bitchinville.tumblr.com/post/87022612971/historia-de-la-musica-
rock-locas" target="_blank">Historia de la Musica Rock: Locas</a>’ to his
tumblr. Among the many tweeters linking to the post was Nick Abadzis, artist
on <em><a href="http://cigarlovespipe.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">The Cigar
That Fell In Love With A Pipe</a></em>. Doing a great service to humankind,
Soria has trawled through the first volume of Jaime Hernandez’ <em><a
href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/576-gifts/572-quick-gift-ideas
/fantagraphics/738-locas-the-maggie-and-hopey-stories-sold-out.html"
target="_blank">Locas</a></em> stories and noted down any song mentioned and
compiled them into a playlist. That’s 704 pages from the first 50 issues of
<em>Love &amp; Rockets.</em> He’s not even the first person to attempt this,
in 2006 <a href="http://robertwboyd.blogspot.co.uk/2006_09_01_archive.html"
target="_blank">Robert Boyd</a> listed all the songs he could find in both
Jaime &amp; Gilbert’s work. However, Soria actually compiled all the songs
into a downloadable file, not that I would ever condone such a thing
*ahem*</p>

	It’s an impressive list, featuring bands that you would expect such as <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHR-rzUjCzU&amp;list=RDHCbOSO76hOM7k"
target="_blank">Black Flag</a> (although I would have sworn they would have
had more than one song mentioned) and <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogypBUCb7DA&amp;list=RDogypBUCb7DA#t=4"
target="_blank">X-Ray Spex</a> that soundtrack Maggie’s adolescence, as well
as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulmIyqb6W-8&amp;feature=kp"
target="_blank">Lou Christie</a> and the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCtdKWWfZG8&amp;feature=kp"
target="_blank">Allman Brothers Band</a>. The latter acts were both covered
by Hopey’s band. Famously, Hopey misheard the lyrics of Christie’s <em>Two
Faces Have I</em> and it becomes a running joke. Years later when Izzy bumps
into Terry playing a solo gig she heckles from the audience ‘play <em>Do
Vases Have Eye</em>s’.

	Country, rock, easy listening, punk, new wave, hip hop and even TV theme
tunes are included. The playlist is a wonderful way to enter into the
cartoonist’s mind and the list betrays the many musical influences in Jaime
Hernandez’ life. In the <a
href="http://www.abramsbooks.com/Books/The_Art_of_Jaime_Hernandez-
9780810995703.html" target="_blank"><em>Art of Jaime Hernandez</em></a>, Todd
Hignite noted how important Jaime’s mother Aurora was in his formative
musical world (as well as so much else for Los Bros). At home Aurora would
listen to the local pop radio as well traditional Mexican music. Later Jaime
would be influenced by the hard rock and glam tastes of his older brothers
but then punk broke and it changed the lives of Los Bros Hernandez. For a
while Gilbert and Jaime played in garage bands Beer Gut and Suspicion but
they decided being cartoonists was the career for them. Their younger brother
Ismael pursued music more seriously becoming the bassist in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nardcore" target="_blank">Nardcore</a>
band Dr Know. All these influences show up in Jaime’s stories.

	The likes of Spotify and YouTube mean it is now easy for artists (or
fans) to create playlists to promote their work or to reveal influences. <a

Liam Butler from K records website.[/caption] <p dir="ltr">Indeed, like Los
Bros, Castrée also plays music but she has managed to successfully intertwine
it with being a cartoonist. In fact, she did not start making music until
after she was making comics. In an interview with <em><a
href="http://www.tcj.com/the-genevieve-castree-interview/"
target="_blank">The Comics Journal </a></em>Castrée describes how when she
came to make <em><a
href="http://www.hoodedutilitarian.com/2013/05/pamplemoussi-by-genevieve-
castree/" target="_blank">Pamplemoussi</a></em>, for Montreal based
publishers <a href="http://www.oiedecravan.com/english.html"
target="_blank">L'Oie de Cravan</a>, she wanted it to also contain music.
However, she had to learn from scratch how to make the music she wanted ‘I
don’t want anyone else to write the music, I’m going to do it. So I kind of
had to teach myself how to make notes with the guitar’. Castrée has gone on
to make music under the name <a href="http://krecs.com/artists/woelv/"
target="_blank">Woelv</a> (the album <em>Tout Seul dans la Forêt en Plein
Jour, Avez-Vous Peur?</em> also came with a book) and she currently records
as <a href="http://www.opaon.ca/" target="_blank">Ô Paon</a>. If you like
droney, slightly folky music with singing in French then check it out, it’s
great!</p> <p dir="ltr">Reading about Soria’s <em>Locas</em> playlist
immediately made me think of the <a
href="http://www.blankslatebooks.co.uk/2012/08/hugo-tate-the-official-
soundtrack/" target="_blank">mix</a> that Blank Slate Books released when
they published the collected edition of <em>Hugo Tate</em> by Nick Abadzis
(author of the acclaimed <em><a href="http://www.nickabadzis.com/laika/"
target="_blank">Laika</a></em>) in 2012. I briefly mentioned <em>Hugo Tate,
</em>which has a quote from <em>The Comics Journal</em> on the front cover
comparing it to <em>Love &amp; Rockets,</em> when I was discussing
<em>Deadline</em> <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/03/27/160-black-and-white-and-read-
all-over/" target="_blank">last time out</a>. Like Hernandez there are TV and
film theme tunes (as well as incidental pieces) amongst the music, and like
Castrée there is room for Iggy and the Stooges. I got in touch with Abadzis
to ask him about the mix.</p>


	[caption id="attachment_3737" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a

width="600" height="600" /></a> Cover for the <em>Hugo Tate</em> playlist ©
Nick Abadzis[/caption] <p dir="ltr">He reminded me that an early version of
the playlist turns up as a mixtape in the book in the strip <em>Ancient
History</em>. When Hugo leaves for America he sends his friend Jason a
cassette filled with music they both like (you know, when mixtapes actually
were on tape!). Jason is confused as it is all music he already owns.
According to Abadzis, Hugo knew that but he was ‘trying to tell his friend
how much he liked him and that he was going to miss listening to those songs
with him’. This highlights an important social aspect of mixtapes and
playlists especially in the past when they would be handed to someone on a
physical format to play rather than streamed on a website. As Abadzis puts it
‘making an artifact to give to someone, a little box that contains sounds you
love’. A mixtape might be used to woo someone, or just to say that you
enjoyed their company, ‘If I ever gave you a tape or burned you a CD, I
must've liked you’.</p>

width="600" height="537" /></a> Detail from <em>Hugo Tate - Ancient
History</em> © Nick Abadzis[/caption] <p dir="ltr">The tracks on the Hugo
Tate mix are all songs that Abadzis loves but he compiled them from Hugo’s
mid 90s point of view. With music from the past there is always an element of
time travel involved, I can’t hear The The’s <em><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz50N2_tCCg&amp;feature=kp">Uncertain
Smile</a></em> without being transported back to 1988 and walking around with
my headphones on. I asked Abadzis if, like Los Bros and Castrée, he had ever
been a musician but he explained that despite being from a musical family and
having lessons as a kid he had ‘lapsed’. However music is obviously very
important to him and he mentioned that being a DJ might have been a viable
option if cartooning hadn’t worked out.</p> <p dir="ltr">With such a
true-to-life feeling to the storytelling in <em>Hugo Tate</em> I asked
Abadzis how autobiographical it was. He explained that there were elements of
his life in the story, and his younger self in Hugo but this was ‘the process
of fiction at work’. Reading <em>Ancient History</em> again after chatting to
Abadzis, I can see elements of him in other characters too. Jason talks about
getting some decks and being a DJ despite Stan trying to get him to join a
band. He is also open minded about music and excited to ‘dig around the
Record and Tape Exchange, unearth forgotten gems.’ I actually worked in <a
href="http://www.mgeshops.com/" target="_blank">Record and Tape</a> in the
late 1990s, I know just how much digging he would have to do.</p>

History</em> is dedicated to the friends that Abadzis used to exchange
mixtapes with and is actually a love letter to friendship and to the lost art
of recording a physical mixtape. Compiling a digital playlist just doesn’t
have the same emotional connection, especially for us folks of a certain
vintage. It also highlights the importance of music in many of our lives.
Ruminating on his potential alternative career as a DJ, Abadzis noted that
comics are only one kind of storytelling medium - ‘You can tell stories with
music too’</p> <p dir="ltr"></p>]]></content:encoded>

Too</a></em>"<em>) made me unearth and update these notes. </em> <h1></h1>
<strong>C</strong>harles Hatfield points out in his <em>Alternative Comics:
An Emerging Literature</em> (2005), that the format and vocabulary of comic
books was very consciously appropriated and turned upside-down by underground
cartoonists such as Robert Crumb, Harvey Kurtzman, Gilbert Shelton and Spain
Rodriguez, who used the recognisable material traits of the superhero comics
to deal with subjects that were too “dangerous” for the Comics Book
Authority, children or merely mainstream culture.  According to Hatfield, the
undergrounds “transformed an object that was jejune and mechanical in origin
into a radically new kind of expressive object” (2005:7).

	I feel one needs to emphasise that this does not mean that the authors
publishing their work through the established channels had not done something
similar with the format decades earlier. The comic book as a specific
physical product (the paper, the flexible spine, the staples, the size and
shape, the number of pages) was essentially “an expressive object;” and it
was the tired, endlessly censored conventions of the mainstream comic book
that the undergrounds redefined in unprecedented ways.

	The differences between syndicated newspaper comic strips that appealed
to children and adults alike (Charles Schulz's <em>Peanuts</em>, started in
1950), comic books dealing with serious topics (like Jack Cole's<em> True
Crime Comics</em> which started in 1947 and dealt with drug addiction) and
comic magazines (like Harvey Kurtzman's <em>MAD</em>, which started in 1952)
were well defined in the publishing market. Kurtzman's seminal work for
<em>MAD</em> and William Gaines's EC Comics of the 1950s were themselves the
conflation of different aesthetics that would cause scandal and massive
censorship. Kurtzman's graphic style and profound sense of artistic rebellion
was later imitated by underground cartoonists.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Their presence in the cultural landscape coincided with important
artistic events such as the first draft of Jack Kerouac's <em>On the
Road</em> (1952). Kerouac's novel has jazz music as its “binding component”
(Elborough 2008: 101), and it could be argued that the whole beat literary
movement would not have taken place without the appearance of jazz music
long-playing records circa 1951, which played at 33 1/3 revolutions per
minute, and substituted the more limited 78-rpm records that previously were
the only available form of recorded jazz (the 7-inch 45 rpm record was
introduced by RCA in 1949).

	According to jazz critic Whitney Balliet, “by destroying the arbitrary
time limitations of 78-rpm recordings” the LP record “suddenly encouraged any
number of new musical approaches simply by making room for them” ("The Sound
of Surprise". 1959, in Elborough 2008:100; Balliet 2001). The “automatic
writing” of the Beat writers was not only an aesthetic move, it was the
expression of the conflation of the technologies available at the time, such
as the typewriter, the record player, and, it should be added, synthetic
drugs, which imposed a new tempo by enabling different speeds at which to
write, listen to music and experience “reality.”

	Kerouac famously wrote <em>On the Road</em> on three weeks with a
typewriter on a continuous roll of paper (“foot-long tele-type paper”).
Interviewed in <a title="http://youtu.be/QzCF6hgEfto"
href="http://youtu.be/QzCF6hgEfto" target="_blank">1959</a> by Steve Allen in
his TV show, he explained: “If I write narrative novels, I don't want to
change my narrative thought: I keep going...” (Antonelli 1985).

	Until recently, considerable number of pages of comics scholarship took
for granted that comic books were codex, stapled publications. The pysical
dimensions, type of paper, conditions of reproduction and distribution (as
well as the authors' conditions of existence and their employers' and
publishers' demands) played a key role in determining the type of stories
produced (including length). Like the 78-rpm and LP records in the case of
jazz and blues, the 7-inch single in the case of pop and punk music and the
12-inch single for dance music, the object itself (the comic book) determined
the expression it contained (the comic). The term "expressive object" is
therefore a complex construct referring not only to a <em>thing</em>, but to
a <em>meaningful thing</em> that is not only text, but always-already complex
context.

	The influence of the Beat Generation on the work of underground
cartoonists is well documented , as is their preference for jazz music
recorded on vinyl (Zwigoff 1994; Springer Berman 2003). Xerox manufactured
the first photocopier in 1949, and by the mid 1960's they were in all
American offices; by the 1970's the local copy shop was an institution and by
the 1980's “truly affordable high-quality reproduction was in full bloom.”
(Dowd 2004:24). The emergence of an underground comic book movement was
inserted within this cultural matrix that combined the popularisation of the
photocopying machine, the widespread production and distribution of LP
records and the larger public awareness of pop culture and mass media as
agents of social change.

	The appearance of the first book printed with photocomposition in 1953
was as liberating for the book industry as the appearance of the LP album was
for musicians, writers and actors (it was in 1950 that Argo set up to record
Shakespeare's complete works on LP albums). These new technologies of
reproduction had profound consequences on the material that was produced,
which included the increased availability of photocopying machines in
university campuses throughout the United States at a time of political and
artistic unrest.

	In 2009  bookshops in the UK were receiving <i>The Beats. A Graphic
History </i>(2009) written by 1970's underground comic book legend Harvey
Pekar and illustrated by various artists and printed in black and white<sup>.
</sup>It is well-known that Robert Crumb is a collector of 78-rpm records
(Zwigoff, 1994). In his “Robert Crumb's Depression's Graph” (<a
title="http://jamreilly.tumblr.com/image/824475955"
href="http://jamreilly.tumblr.com/image/824475955" target="_blank">2005</a>),
Crumb himself identifies his interest in 78 records as a relevant
biographical point in his life. Other famous cartoonists who are well-known
vinyl record collectors of musical genres such as blues, jazz, bluegrass and
Americana are Pekar, Clowes and Ware. (I remember fondly visiting Dan and
Erika Clowes' home in 2001 and marveling at his carefully curated record
collection).

	Psychologists, musicologists and some social scientists have written
about the social and <a
title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3741536/"
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3741536/"
target="_blank">psychological function</a>s of (and reasons to listen to)
music and its influence on other cultural practices, but the case of comics
and music remains largely unexplored in recent comics studies (how music is
represented in comics is a different question, see Brown <a
title="http://www.comicsgrid.com/article/view/cg.aj/23"
href="http://www.comicsgrid.com/article/view/cg.aj/23"
target="_blank">2013</a> for interesting insights).

	As Dowd points out, one of the outstanding characteristics of the
underground comic book movement was “a founding imperative for
self-publishing in comics that represents a break with standard method of
production” (Dowd 2004:20-21). Self-publishing has been a well-established
mode of production of illustrated magazines and books. Conservative American
critics of the comic book medium in the 1950s such as Gilbert Seldes,
attempted to disconnect comic books from “the dime novel of fifty years ago.”
According to Seldes, “the dime novel was a printed text, sparsely
illustrated, if at all, and therefore had to be read.” (1956:91).

	Seldes assumed that comic books were not “read,” in spite of the fact he
constantly refers to “comic book readers.” A conservative cultural ritic who
vocally opposed to comics, Seldes was paradoxically one of the earliest
commentators of the form: by 1924 he had written an essay on 'Krazy Kat',
including comics in his S<em>even Lively Arts</em> (1962). At the time, the
established processes of comic book production were so rigid that
self-publishing was a liberating practice that put the control of the
artistic creation back in the hands of the author, rather than the publishing
house.

	Unlike the mainstream comics of the 1950s, underground comix were
distributed through “specialised shops”, which in 1960s America meant “head
shops,” where they were sold next to drug and rock and roll paraphernalia .
The materiality of the comic book as publication (in many cases almost
completely controlled by the author) was extended and modified by the
emergence of new channels of distribution, which included common spaces for
different cultural practices such as poetry readings, political meetings and
small concerts. Robert Crumb, the leading figure of the American underground
comics movement, personally folded, stapled and sold copies of <em>Zap
Comix</em> No. 0 on the streets of San Francisco in 1967 (Rosenkranz 2002;
Danky and Kitchen 2009). Harvey Kurtzman's aesthetic legacy could be felt
from the cover itself and it is now one of the most valuable and sought-after
comic books.

	A mint condition copy of 1967's <em>Zap Comix</em> No. 0 remains
impossible to find (and if it existed it would most likely be unaffordable by
regular salaried human beings). Underground comics were read, shared,
exchanged, and treasured because of all that. They were not, at the time,
preserved unread for posterity. The fragility of the stapled comic book seems
inversely proportional to the obsessive behaviour of cartoonists as record
collectors (and of comic book readers as collectors of anything).

	The collector and the historian are often concerned with preserving what
is not only valuable but in danger of disappearing. The collector (and I
suppose the historian as well) does not only accumulates objects ("things"),
but recognises in them their meaning and provides them with new ones. The
contradictory pulsions of destruction/preservation seem to find
reverberations in the relationships between physical formats and contraints
and creative expression.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b><b> </b></b> <p
dir="ltr">So far this series of posts on comics and music has confirmed that
there are no shortage of comics either about music or featuring music as an
important, integral element of their narrative, particularly in the spheres
of alternative or indie comics. I’ve always held music and comics in a
similar space in my brain, and have discovered many cartoonists through
musicians and vice versa, which has created the bubbling thought in the back
of my mind that there is a very real synergy between music and comics, and
that it’s a synergy that’s more unique than we tend to give it credit for,
though many scholars have looked into it with intriguing results. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/04/25/164-unfamiliar-history-ed-
piskors-hip-hop-family-tree/">Peter Wilkins acknowledged this</a> in his
excellent piece on Ed Piskor’s Hip Hop Family Tree, when he wrote that
“representing a musical, aural phenomenon in pictures and writing works
surprisingly well,” and he also described hip-hop as a “truly multimodal
movement that deserves a multimodal history.” If I may extend this idea,
Graphixia has been great at exploring the multimodality of comics, and I
think comics and music will be an enlightening foray into exploring this
multimodality further. So, without further ado, here’s a little on my
favourite musical comics of late.</p> <b><b> </b></b> <p dir="ltr"><img

dir="ltr">Alec Longstreth’s three-part musical story Weezer Fan is still in
progress, and is being serialized in his long-running comic, Phase 7, which
has by turns been comprised of autobiographical stories, chapters of
Longstreth’s now completed Bone-esque epic Basewood, and other miscellanea
such as the three chapters of Weezer Fan, the third of which is due to be
released later this year. The first part is ten very short stories, each one
corresponding to one of the ten tracks on Weezer’s seminal Blue Album and
narrating an anecdote from Longstreth’s life as a Weezer fan. The second part
depicts Longstreth’s first attendance at a Weezer show and interactions with
other fans, and is the closest in content and composition to the fanzines the
Weezer Fan series can trace its lineage back to. And the third part will
catalogue all of Longstreth’s experiences at Weezer shows.</p>
<b><b> </b></b> <p dir="ltr">At this point, perhaps a disclaimer is
necessary: I am also a Weezer superfan, and would say they are probably my
favourite band (but I don’t want to talk about <a
href="http://www.weezerpedia.com/wiki/index.php?title=Hurley">Hurley</a>). So
much so that I’m considering getting a tattoo of their winged W logo. So, as
you can imagine, finding a thing that combines on of my most cherished things
(Weezer) with my favourite art form and the focus of my doctoral research
(Alternative Comics) was like several Christmases all at once. It was like if
<a

-whiny-children-or-why-whiny-comics-are-ok-sometimes/">Jeffrey Brown</a>
showed up at my house on Christmas Day, dressed up as Father Christmas, and
gave me a huge stack of comics and CDs. As such, my love for Weezer might
colour my judgment and any analyses which follow. But I’ll do my best to
remain objective, and I don’t believe Weezer fandom is a prerequisite for
reading and enjoying these comics.</p> <p dir="ltr"><img alt=":Phase

width="496px;" height="619px;" /></p> <p dir="ltr">The opening of part one
finds a young Longstreth’s first exposure to Weezer being coloured somewhat
by the circumstance of their soundtracking some reckless driving. Here, the
musical notes are combined with lines of varying length and shape to provide
a shorthand for the teenage Longstreth’s discomfort which draws upon the
existing visual conventions and symbols of comics to create a neat,
recognizable visual expression of Longstreth’s experience. Similarly, when it
is necessary to up the ante to show Longstreth’s emotion growing from
discomfort to panic over the course of the next few panels, the lines grow
closer together and the song’s lyrics are shown in large capital letters
which are obscured by Longstreth’s thought bubble and body, showing the
reader that the music is loud and obtrusive, but that the panic created by
the reckless driving is taking centre stage in the narrative. The same line
patterns and typographic depictions of the lyrics are used at the end of the
story when the teenaged Longstreth discovers Weezer properly and rocks out
alone to Weezer in his bedroom, reprising the adrenaline rush created by the
car journey but turning it into a positive energy rather than a negative
one.</p> <p dir="ltr"><img alt=":Phase 7:P7_017_10.gif"

height="701px;" /></p> <b><b> </b></b> <p dir="ltr">The Weezer Fan stories
continue to use music in this vein throughout. Thus, music, lyrics and and
musical notation are used as devices in the same way as other icons and
visual shorthands in comics, such as emanata, which is one basic level of how
comics-music synthesis can work. I’ll leave it to those who close-read comics
and analyse them from a linguistic or formalist angle to explore this
further, and I hope someone does study this closely for a paper in the
future.</p> <p dir="ltr"><img alt=":Phase 7:P7_019_07.jpg"

width="561px;" height="711px;" /></p> <p dir="ltr">Another level of
music-comics synthesis lies in fandom and the crossover between alternative
comics and fanzines, two cultures with a shared history. I suggested that
fanzines directly inspired Longstreth’s Weezer comics, and this is made clear
in part one, where we see the teenage Longstreth joining the Weezer fan club
and receiving the Weezine, Weezer’s fanzine. Pointing to him is a caption
which reads “has no idea that in seven years he will be obsessed with making
zines of his own.” It wouldn’t be a stretch to draw from this that Weezer
fandom directly contributed to Longstreth’s becoming a cartoonist and shaped
his approach to comics, particularly as Phase 7 has been self-published since
its inception and continues to be so, following the tradition of Dave Sim and
Jeff Smith. Zines and their DIY ethic have long been a springboard for
experimental and alternative cartooning, as well as a niche, underground
cultural space in which music and comics have rubbed along together, and
there is a synthesis there which has fed through from their history to
Longstreth’s Weezer comics.</p> <b><b> </b></b> <p dir="ltr">The second part
of Weezer Fan feels much more like a zine, as the story of Longstreth’s first
Weezer concert is followed by a selection of black and white photos and a
prose description of his research for the comic, which is classic fanzine
territory: photos of the band, photos of the band interacting with fans, and
general fan love-ins. The story also concludes with a scan of the ticket to
the show, in a showing off of fan cred which slots neatly into the comic
narrative. It could perhaps even be argued that the ticket itself constitutes
a panel, as it is not enclosed in borders like all the other depictions of
Weezer-ness in the comic. This could even be stretched to the depictions of
Weezer’s album covers in sequence on the cover of the forthcoming Phase 7
#019, which line up like panels to narrate the story of Weezer’s career.</p>

areas of music-comics synthesis exhibited by Weezer Fan just begin to scratch
the surface of the myriad ways in which comics and music work brilliantly
together, narratively, culturally, materially and philosophically, and there
are clearly many great in-depth studies that could be done in any of the
areas I have touched upon. On the issue of Weezer fandom, as I said earlier,
I don’t believe you have to be a Weezer fan, or even be aware of Weezer’s
music or what they sound like, to be able to enjoy these comics. But it
certainly helps. The adrenaline rush surrounding <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmIhZYCMgvI">My Name is Jonas</a> does
gain an extra later of multimodal brilliance if one is aware of the song, or
can go as far as to listen to it (as I did) while reading the anecdote about
Longstreth’s discovery of Weezer. However, the narrative intent of the comic
is still accessible and clear, and with or without the soundtrack, the comics
use music and its language and conventions to great effect, as many other
comics do.</p> <b><b> </b></b> <p dir="ltr">The final two pages of Weezer Fan
Part One depict a teenage Longstreth listening to <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spkVX8z-vs">Only In Dreams</a>, The
Blue Album’s eight-minute, euphoric conclusion, alone in the dark in the
living room of his parental home. The panels are all overlaid with a halftone
pattern which represents both the darkness and the euphoria, casting the
images in a different light to all those which precede them in the comic as
Longstreth describes the rare quality of Weezer’s music and the reason they
are his favourite band and that The Blue Album is his favourite album. “It’s
the kind of music that expands inside of you, amplifying your senses, making
you feel more alive,” he writes. His teenage self, drawn at peace with a
slight smile, is the centre of the panel with the musical notes surrounding
him, as if they are leaving his body and he has indeed become the amplifier.
In depicting them thus, Longstreth shows us that comics can capture the
qualities of music to create a unique multimodal reading experience, and I
don’t know about you, but that certainly makes me feel alive.</p>

in Comics: Intermediality and Mahler’s Mystery Music</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;  Well-known for
his absurd humor, the Austrian cartoonist Mahler develops in his mini-comic
<i>Mystery Music</i> a visualization of musical sounds as mysterious black
things with all sorts of shapes, but quite often with a turd-like aspect. If
you take that comparison far enough, you can easily imagine all kind of
connections between music and defecating, but that is certainly not what I am
going to develop in the following lines; after all, Mahler’s (that is, the
cartoonist’s) music is a mystery, and perhaps it should remain so. By
visually materializing music, Mahler creates an ironic distance, drawing
attention to the way music and sound are usually depicted in comics.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fig1.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3789" alt="fig1"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fig1.jpg" width="607"
height="861" /></a>  In this regard, Mahler’s ‘experimentation’ cannot be
dissociated from its publication context. Mahler’s mini-comic is not a
‘proper’ mini-comic: it has its outlook and its dimension, but it is not
photocopied and stapled by the author or by a small-press collective. Though
Mahler is Austrian, his comic was specifically produced for and published by
L’Association in the ‘Patte de Mouche’ series. This series is a collection of
mini-comics that point out the roots of the publisher in the small-press. The
‘Patte de Mouche’ comics often carry out a playful investigation of the
comics form through constraints (OuBaPo), narrative tricks and graphic games.
Mahler’s mini-comic on music clearly follows that line by estranging the
reader from traditional representations of music in comics.  Perhaps at cost
of losing the fun of the story, I think it might be fruitful to look at
<i>Mystery Music</i> from an intermedial perspective, using theoretical
concepts that might highlight some interesting points about Mahler’s work.
The intermedial framework and terminology proposed by Irina O. Rajewsky
(2005) might prove useful in this regard. She focuses on intermediality “as a
category for the concrete analysis of texts or other kinds of media products”
(2005: 51), putting forward subcategories to distinguish between various
specific types of intermedial phenomena. One of these subcategories is what
Rajewsky calls ‘intermedial references,’ that is: “Rather than combining
different medial forms of articulation, the given media-product thematizes,
evokes, or imitates elements or structures of another, conventionally
distinct medium through the use of its own media-specific means” (53). This
type of intermediality is further distinguished from others by an ‘as if’
character: a media-product becomes intermedial by alluding to another medium
(be it a concrete instance or the medium itself). As Rajewsky writes:  &nbsp;
<blockquote>Intermedial references, then, can be distinguished from
intramedial (and thus intertextual) ones by the fact that a given media
product cannot use or genuinely reproduce elements or structures of a
different medial system through its own media-specific means; it can only
evoke or imitate them. Consequently, an intermedial reference can only
generate an illusion of another medium’s specific practices (55)</blockquote>
&nbsp;  The difference from other types of intermediality, here, is that
there is only an illusion of an actual blending of various media. By applying
this category to Mystery Music, I mean to use it as a methodological tool apt
to bring to the fore certain elements with relationship to its representation
of music: I do not mean to suggest that this is the only type of
intermediality present in comics, nor that it is the only way that comics can
represent music (as the previous posts make clear); neither am I engaging
with the question of intermediality <i>within</i> the comics form. The basic
issue for comics to represent music is that they have to <i>visualize</i> it
in some way.  Of course, as W.J.T. Mitchell (2005) has argued, “there are no
visual media” and “all media are mixed media” inasmuch as they always entail
“some mixture of sensory, perceptual, and semiotic elements,” albeit in a
medium-specific way (2005: 260). As Ian Hague’s recent <i>Comics and the
Senses</i> (2014) makes clear, “comics is not just a visual medium” (26) and
their reading call up an array of senses. Hague’s focus is, for instance, on
the “actual/audible sounds that comics make and/or employ, as opposed to the
visually represented sounds upon the page” (27). My own emphasis is, more
traditionally, on the visualization of music on the page.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fig2.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3790" alt="fig2"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fig2.jpg"
width="1168" height="811" /></a>  The way Mahler represents music is highly
interesting because it subverts comics conventions, not so much regarding the
representation of music (which appears to be highly varied), but as far as
the way comics visual represent sounds. Speech balloons and onomatopoeia are
among the most discussed elements of comics, especially in early scholarly
attempts to define the form. They are conventionally agreed upon signs,
visually delineating sounds that are not supposed to be visible in the
diegetic world evoked by the drawings. These conventions, however, make room
for tremendous variety and creativity: as Hannah Miodrag rightfully remarks,
“the conventionalized shorthand that forms the cartoon lexicon is exemplary
in proving extremely flexible” (2013: 182). The ‘trick’ that Mahler plays out
in <i>Mystery Music</i> consists in representing sound as a kind of visible
‘soundtrack’ existing <i>materially</i> in the fictional world of the
mini-comic.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fig3.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3791" alt="fig3"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fig3.jpg"
width="1187" height="822" /></a>  Each gag is based on the material shape
that the musician creates when performing, ending with a jury physically
receiving the music as a literal thing. A saxophone jazz solo gives shape to
a long snake; an extraterrestrial flying saucer turned into a xylophone
results in a pile of small black balls; a single stroke of an electric guitar
creates a wall; an opera singer forms three big black globes; a pipe organ
produces an enormous excrement-like shape. The shape clearly evokes the sound
of the music made by a particular instrument. The final gag further brings
this analogy to a peak: after the performance of the ‘big band,’ the curtain
falls, and the story ends on a final page-wide panel depicting a worker
picking up the physical excess-products of the music as if it were trash.
This specific convention that <i>Mystery Music</i> establishes is also
brought to the fore when the lack of sound is represented in the same ways as
music is. Striking the gong transforms the performer into a shot putter:
failing to hit the gong, he throws the stick to the jury, who contemplates a
note-like black shape.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fig4.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3792" alt="fig4"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fig4.jpg" width="555"
height="792" /></a>  Throughout his mini-comic, Mahler thus reflexively draws
attention to the ‘as if’ character of his intermedial reference. Music turns
out to be a physical thing, the material remains of a musical performance.
This mysterious physicality foregrounds the visualization of the music (and
the lack of sound) and the conventions of the cartoon lexicon: Mahler’s
sounds are things that characters produce and can interact with because,
ultimately, they are all made of the same substance of lines and ink. In the
end, Mahler’s gags are read as much for his minimalist drawing style as for
the gags. In his pioneering article on the narrativity of the line, Jared
Gardner convincingly argues that:  &nbsp; <blockquote>The story of the
graphic narrative is always finally two stories, equally and at once: the
story of what happens to the characters and (in the graphic traces we cannot
erase but never fully recover) the story of the telling of the story itself
(2011: 67).</blockquote> &nbsp;  The minimalism of Mahler’s graphic style
allows him to play with small, singular details sustaining the humor of his
stories: the stick of the gong player is one example, but also the sticks of
the extraterrestrial musician function as his antennas, the head of the
pan-flute player moves alongside its instrument as if she had no neck, etc. 
Finally, Mahler’s comic also involves actual sound: it was adapted into an <a
href="http://vimeo.com/69111794">animation</a> short that proposes an actual
soundtrack for the mini-comic. The short further continues the mystery of the
mini-comic with a surprising UFO-like soundtrack, continuing the reflexive
effect that foregrounds the ‘as if’ character of intermedial referencing,
insofar as the video both evokes the mini-comic it was adapted from and the
medium of music (blending Rajewsky’s category with the one she calls ‘medial
transposition,’ i.e. adaptation).  &nbsp;  Works Cited  &nbsp;  Gardner,

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">One of the
British Columbia towns I grew up in was Trail, home of the glorious Smoke
Eaters hockey team that won the World Championship in 1939 and 1961 and
competed for the Allan Cup, the pinnacle of senior men's hockey in Canada. In
my early teens going to Smokies games was the primary winter weekend
entertainment. The players worked in the Cominco smelter during the week and
assumed the heroic mantle of hockey stars on the weekends in the Western
International Hockey League, playing against teams like The Spokane Jets and
The Kimberley Dynamiters. The league was full of players who had played a few
games in the NHL and who might play in the NHL one day.</p>  When my minor
hockey team played on a Friday afternoon, we could smell the fat being heated
up for the evening Smoke Eaters game's chips. The hockey was vital and
violent, and with every game you felt the history of the city permeating
events, with the great stars from 1961, most of them children of Italian
immigrants, and the great stars of the future, like Ray Ferraro, in
attendance. I'm sure there were people in Trail who didn't like hockey, but
on game night it felt like everyone was there, with the hardcore fans
standing and smoking behind the last row of wooden plank seats.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/
trail_smoke_eaters_1995.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3810"

src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/
trail_smoke_eaters_1995.jpg" width="230" height="219" /></a>  Senior hockey
is dead in the Kootenays now along with much of the mythical power of hockey
in Canada, the Smoke Eaters exist only as a junior hockey team, and the NHL
is an antiseptic, dreary league with the exception of a few sparks in the
playoffs, when the rules change (largely by disappearing).  Jeff Lemire’s
<em>Essex County</em> took me back to the mythical world of Canadian hockey
with startling clarity and made me reflect on the way that Canadian identity
has been so wrapped up in the masculine sacrifice of the heroes of our
national game. Apart from Chester Brown's <em>Louis Riel</em>, perhaps,
<em>Essex County</em> is the most Canadian comic book I have read, largely
because of the place of hockey in the LeBeuf masculine family lineage. And it
is an especially masculine family lineage; like classic Disney films, Essex
County kills off mothers.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/My-mom-died-last-
year.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3806" alt="My mom died
last year"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/My-mom-died-last-year
.jpg" width="1024" height="768" /></a>  The crux of the story is that Lester
Papineau does not know that Jimmy LeBeuf, the former hockey player who works
at the local Esso gas station, is his father. Jimmy played one game with the
Toronto Maple Leafs. In that game he scored a goal and was then hit so hard
that it not only ended his brief career but also left him "not quite right"
ever since. Lester lives on a farm with his uncle. Jimmy is supposed to stay
away from Lester, for reasons that Lemire conceals--something to do with his
treatment of Lester’s mother Claire--but forms a bond with him when Lester
buys superhero comics from the gas station. When they meet at the creek,
Jimmy is willing to participate in Lester's alien invasion fantasies and
appreciate his self-drawn comics.  Lemire’s drawing style in Essex county
seems to identify both with Jimmy’s post-injury state of mind and Lester’s
bereft orphanhood. His lines look like they were drawn by a really talented
person drawing with his wrong hand. The lines, which appear barely in control
and highly skilled at the same time, carry the suffering of the characters,
particularly the hockey playing men. Jimmy's face conveys a depth of longing
and despair: his eyes are wider apart than they should be, and his nose looks
like it was carved out of rock. This is the face of of the hockey player as
it exists in the Canadian imagination, tough, knocked about.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Spearfishin.jpg"><
img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3807" alt="Spearfishin'"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Spearfishin.jpg"
width="1024" height="768" /></a>  Jimmy’s “man-child” aspect and his ability
to identify with Lester’s superhero fantasies capture the out-of-touch with
reality masculinity of Essex County. On the one hand, lies the world of
mundane work at the gas station, driving street cars, working the farm. On
the other lies the imaginary realm of hockey, where spectacular feats of
heroism are possible, but with huge risks, as Jimmy’s state indicates. His
great uncle Lou also had to leave the game with a wrecked knee. But Jimmy
tells Lester that he is mystified when people talk as if his one game in the
NHL was the worst day of his life when in fact, in his mind, it was the best.
Playing that game and scoring that goal was worth the addled brain that
followed.  A character like Vince, Jimmy’s grandfather, is an oddity. A
talented player who could make it to the NHL, he gives up the game cheerfully
for domestic bliss and life on the farm, for which he is punished by the
death of his wife and daughter in a car crash that Jimmy somehow survives.
Indeed, <em>Essex County</em> strands its male characters. Lemire isolates
them and draws their pain. The orphan as literary figure exemplifies
masculine self-determination and freedom. Without parents to guide his
upbringing or provide genetic comparisons, the orphan creates himself through
his choices and actions, the perfect existentialist. But the flipside of
orphanhood is loneliness and disconnection.  Lou LeBeuf, who appears to have
no sexual relationship apart from a one night stand with his brother’s wife,
Beth, expresses the plight of the individual as disconnected atom. He says
that there are two ways to be absolutely alone: in the middle of a crowd or
in total isolation. But this isolation seems unnecessary. Why choose it? 
Lester appears to be so stunned by his orphaned state that any relationship
is impossible. He can barely stand to eat dinner or watch a hockey game with
his uncle. He retreats into his own solipsistic fantasy world of Power Man.
Comic books are both the antidote to his despair and the cause of it:
traumatised by his mother’s death, he wears a mask and a cape to school even
though his school mates taunt him for it.  <a

jpg" width="1024" height="768" /></a>  Once again, hockey acts as the
saviour: Lester’s success as a hockey player buys him status, just as it has
done for his father, grandfather, and great uncle. It doesn’t buy him social
or familial connection though.  It’s curious that Lemire is so adamant about
denying his male characters such connection. The gender politics of <em>Essex
County</em> are decidedly odd. Relations with women, in the conventional
sexual social sense, offer a way out of masculine isolation but the male
characters either do not choose that path or get punished for it if they do,
like Vince,  and homosexuality doesn’t even seem like a possibility for these
solitary, haunted, regretful men.  What these characters seek, perhaps, is a
comprehensible affective relationship with each other: Fathers, sons, and
brothers. The barrier between Jimmy and Lester and the disharmony between Lou
and Vince LeBeuf after Lou has sex with Vince’s wife Beth (there’s a lot of
speculation that Lou might be the father of Beth’s daughter and Jimmy’s
father Mary.) Women seem to interfere with these masculine relationships.
Beth’s appearance on the scene destroys Lou’s fantasy of he and Vince making
it together in hockey. His sexual dalliance with her is a form of revenge,
perhaps.  In fact, <em>Essex County</em> is structured around Lou LeBeuf’s
<em>ressentiment</em> towards Vince’s betrayal of hockey, Canada’s true totem
and merciless father. While Lou reflects warmly on the metaphorical
connection between hockey and family when he returns to the arena after years
of being a Toronto street car driver to be what Canadians affectionately call
a “rink rat,” someone who sharpens skates and drives the Zamboni, his
affection screens the fact that hockey cruelly sacrifices men like him and
Jimmy to drab, mundane work when physical ruination kills their heroic
aspirations.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/the-game-is-like-
family.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3809" alt="the game is
like family"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/the-game-is-like-
family.jpg" width="527" height="761" /></a>  We might argue that Lemire
presents a feminine perspective on isolation and orphanhood with Anne Byrne,
the nurse who is the focus of Book Three, but her story carries less weight
and has less independence than that of the LeBeufs and Papineaus because it
is somewhat detached from the story arc that runs through the three books.
Anne is the return of the dead mother in the form of a nurse: she looks after
Lou LeBeuf in the nursing home, and she also is the catalyst in a potential
reconnection between Jimmy and Lester as father and son. Her job in the
narrative is to perform emergency triage on these broken male characters, the
sons of hockey, even as her own family breaks down: her husband has died and
her son is a resentful teenager.  Because <em>Essex County</em> is more
dependent on images than words, it’s hard to tell whether it is critiquing or
supporting the Canadian ideology of masculine identification with, and
sacrifice to, the game at the expense of women.  Lemire’s graphic narrative
is like Ernest Hemingway’s writing in this regard: conventional masculine
toughness is shot through with frailty and weakness. And yet the male
characters are so invested in their own isolation, they can’t see any other
way to be.  <a

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thank you for analysis.  When Lemire introduced
the country nurse it shows a good glimpse into how he viewed this town. Anne
meddles, and where she does so she quite literally attempts to heal more than
just the physical wounds of these guys.  Sure, she could be viewed as a plot
device, but we see plenty of her self-doubt in regards to her role, and also
her longing for more with her own family.

	Seen through the stay in the big city, isolation comes not from the town
itself, but from their self-infliction of it, and much of that stems from
keeping up the facade of masculinity.  Only Anne directly confronts her own
loneliness, and her meddling is needed to help the
others.]]></wp:comment_content> <wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[That frickin' bird. It
shows up everywhere in Jeff Lemire's <em>Essex County</em>. Its first
appearance is marked by a symbolic rather than literal representation: a
small boy trying to fly.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_01.png"><
img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_01-
1024x612.png" alt="wright_174_01" width="1024" height="612"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3824" /></a>  It's a shadow really, a
thick darkly drawn conflation of lines, flung both by brush and narrative up
into the heights. The oddly misshapen lines reappear a little later in the
narrative as the boy's shadow. It trails him awkwardly as he awkwardly
marches into the gas station to purchase a comic from his as yet undiscovered
father.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_01A.png">
<img

1024x516.png" alt="wright_174_01A" width="1024" height="516"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3825" /></a>  Finally, quite a ways
into the narrative the literal bird appears on the horizon, quite abruptly in
terms of sequence, and gently touches down on the barn where the boy has
spent his time feeding the chickens and reading the above mentioned comic to
himself.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_01C.png">

659x1024.png" alt="wright_174_01C" width="659" height="1024"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3826" /></a>  Birds appear elsewhere
in <em>Book One: Tales from the Farm</em>, but they tend to be chickens, and
chickens can't fly. The metaphor here focuses more on the typical circle of
life stuff and the boy's inability to fly away from his situation.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_chickens.
png"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_chickens.
png" alt="wright_174_chickens" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter
size-full wp-image-3827" /></a>  The chickens here are frequently connected
to the cross, a harkening back to both the absence of religious practice and
its yet still overbearing presence in French-Canadian life, particularly that
life from which the "Papineau" clan is clearly descended despite being placed
in Southern Ontario--if we are indeed meant to call forward the real Essex
County (a topography of particulars).  Crosses to bear are with the grounded
chickens, but the bird, that shadowed, thick, darkly drawn lined bird
mentioned above, connected to the boy, is a distorted version. A kind of
off-kilter, slanted, gangly, disturbed cross and it is most often
identifiable by the lines--both the drawn lines and narrative lines--it
introduces. Its trajectory is always outwards, a perspective of lines pushing
outward to a finite point on the horizon and a widening foreground. That bird
also runs throughout the <em>Essex County</em> narrative, overseeing its
progression and guiding its evolution. It, like the comic itself, is made up
of and represented through the line.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_pov3.png"
><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_pov3-
771x1024.png" alt="wright_174_pov3" width="771" height="1024"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3835" /></a>  Lemire's bird and the
lines it both represents and oversees speak to topography, loosely the study
and description of landscapes or shapes themselves--the features, measures,
distinctions that mark borders, heights, nuances. It's also a branch of study
that focuses on local detail, and how those local features might suggest
local histories or cultures. Topography is a bird's science; a kind of "zoom
in / zoom out" approach to understanding how space gets filled in relative to
other filled in spaces. Most often, we think of topography in cartographic
terms--those lines on a map that suggest distinctions such as hills, valleys,
trees, pathways, and objects.  A bald example is <em>Essex County's</em>
family tree. There are several devices of the topographical line in here. One
is the bird's downward and orderly trajectory through the family tree itself,
telling us how to read and layout a topology for the narrative. Another is
the gradual fade of the drawn line as the background image of the face
degrades and lines are added to represent both age and a buildup of life
experiences--the line as a topology of time.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_nostalgia
.png"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_nostalgia-
739x1024.png" alt="wright_174_nostalgia" width="739" height="1024"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3829" /></a>  The faded and
accumulated line frequently invokes resonance: connections to the past, the
single-lined innocence of youth versus the collected, varicose veined line of
age and experience, missing or faded memory, nostalgia--as if missing lines
mean something and so does too many lines, too many connections. The line
then functions as a topology for meaning.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/
wright_174_nostalgia2.png"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_nostalgia2
-715x1024.png" alt="wright_174_nostalgia2" width="715" height="1024"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3830" /></a>  This emphasis on the
line seems central to any poetics for comics. Any critique of comics must
necessarily focus on the line as 1) metaphoric connection to the past, a
literal harkening back to the lines of Kubert, Tardis, Eisner, Crumb (and so
many others: Picasso, Rembrandt, DE Vinci dammit!) and the different
topologies their lines--those distinct, always identifiable lines--represent;
and 2) as central to the reading of symbols, narrative, and stories that
unfold in a graphic situation.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_pov-1.png
"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_pov-1-
768x1024.png" alt="wright_174_pov-1" width="768" height="1024"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3831" /></a>  The image above suggests
another way that Lemire asserts topologies: the tilted and shifting frames
that separate the narrative and at times the action itself. These lines,
contrary to typical comics form, are often tilted or cocked at an angle. This
transcendent line, slanted and uneven, tilts like a curious bird's eye,
perspective always slightly off-balance, darting, blinking, curious. As if
we, and the narrative we see unravelling before us, were perched precariously
on a wire observing the landscapes below. We are reading these lines from a
shifting, curious, unstable, topologic perspective that zooms in and zooms
out, looks down and looks up. We wander in and out of perspective teetering
and tottering through the comic frame, itself a topological framework for the
line.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_pov-1A.
png"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_pov-1A-
768x1024.png" alt="wright_174_pov-1A" width="768" height="1024"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3832" /></a>  These shifting
topological frames are broken and transcended. The topology of place--Essex
County--remains static while the bird motions through it, pushing the
narrative forward, pushing time onward, and forcing the narrative outward
into other spaces away from a place of origin but always that place--Essex
County--remains in the background, its perspective etched in lines out (or
in) toward a finite horizon. Contrarily, the bird rises, a figure of outward
as Charles Olson would suggest, and moves off the page.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_pov1A.png
"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_pov1A-
694x1024.png" alt="wright_174_pov1A" width="694" height="1024"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3833" /></a>  This action is, too,
fractured by the line. The telephone pole shadows in the spread below recall
the elevated point of view above, mimicking the tilted comic frames which
have now become both artificial borders and simulacrum that separate and
recall the literal shadowed topographical, networked, lines that lead both
outward and inward, back and forth, in and out of Essex County.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_pov1B.png
"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_pov1B-
733x1024.png" alt="wright_174_pov1B" width="733" height="1024"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3834" /></a>  In Lemire's collection,
we are always disconnected, reconnected, unconnected and connected by lines.
These connections can move away from us or toward us, into the horizon or
away from the foreground--a topology of connection.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_pov6.png"
><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_pov6-
720x1024.png" alt="wright_174_pov6" width="720" height="1024"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3836" /></a>  The final frame of
<em>Essex County</em> again shows the bird. But, is the bird coming or going?
How are we to read this? The bird is so evenly placed that we cannot read
this. We have only lines and these lines tell us we can go either way. Are
the lines on the "Leaving Essex County" sign indicative of a sunset or a
sunrise? These unknowns; a topology of ambiguity. <!--also, something should
be said about the inherent racism in Lemire's linear representations. The
line suggests more subtle things than surfaces. It also sugget big noses and
other indicators or colonialism and normative representation. -->  The yield
here is how <em>Essex County's</em> bird tells / shows us how to read a comic
through the line. Connections back and connections forward. Thick, aggressive
blotched lines and elegant straight lines; faded, vacuous lines; bunched,
scribbled, unsteady lines. It suggests we need to look more stridently at how
the line reflects both a hinge to the construction of narrative and the
creative mark that the line represents to the artist. What strikes about
<em>Essex County</em> when one reads it in context is how confidently it
represents Lemire's line--from hockey histories (see picture of author),
Canadian places, French-Canadian names, to the work of Crumb, Tardis, and the
irreverence of Reza Farazmand. In short, the book suggests that the line is
foundational for critiquing comics and that <em>Essex County</em> is our
first real bright example of a topography of comics. Now, we must hunt among
stones.<!-- an allusion to Charles Olson's "The Kingfishers" -->

		<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have to
		confess a certain disappointment with Jeff Lemire of late.  This
		isn't entirely fair. The people I should be disappointed with are the
		folks at DC Comics, but since I'm quite literally always disappointed
		with everything DC does, that's not any fun.  [gallery
		ids="3849,3847,3846"]  You see, Jeff Lemire took over <em>Justice
		League of America</em> recently with the intent to relaunch it
		as <em>Justice League Canada</em> and I, <em>Alpha Flight</em> super
		fan and part-time Professional Canadian, was pretty flipping excited.
		But then, the news changed: there would be no <em>Justice League
		Canada</em>; instead, "Justice League Canada" became the first story
		arc of <em>Justice League United</em> (in Canada, we got Justice
		League Canada covers anyway, because pandering), and instead of my
		dreamed-of nouveau <em>Alpha Flight</em>, we got a typical (kind of
		boring*) Justice League story set in Canada. To Lemire's credit, this
		is more like when <em>Alpha Flight</em> went to Calgary than
		when <em>Archie</em> went to Vancouver: the geography of Moosonee /
		Moose Factory actually matters to the narrative. But there's a
		feeling of tokenism here. Adam Strange is Canadian now for...
		reasons? And while I applaud the inclusion of Equinox and the
		decision to make her a Cree teenager (this is <em>good</em>, DC --
		more of this!), it's hard not to feel like she will fade to black
		once this run comes to an end, because the storyline is not
		spectacular enough for me to think she'll take flight.  The
		disappointment I feel at not getting my very own DC version
		of <em>Alpha Flight</em> is profound. This feels like when the comics
		atrocity that was <em>Omega Flight</em> happened at the end
		of <em>Civil War</em> and all my beloved <em>Alpha Flight</em>
		characters died. Why is it so hard to make Canadian superheroes stick
		in a global context?<em> </em>  So when I reread <em>Essex
		County</em> for this week's Graphixia** post, I did so with all these
		questions about Canada and superheroes and what it means to represent
		the nation in a Canadian context.  [caption id="attachment_3852"

		poignant because Canada.[/caption]  This has informed a lot of my
		thinking about Canadian comics, generally, ever since fellow
		Graphixian Peter and I decided to read <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> as a
		superhero comic that inverts and challenges expectations of Canadian
		national identity. (Our work will be in the forthcoming <a
		href="http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9781138025158/"><em>
		Representing Multiculturalism in Comics and Graphic Novels</em></a>.)
		Drawing on the work of scholars like <a
		href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-5931.00063/
		abstract">Ryan Edwardson</a>, <a
		href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02722010609481401?

		U85_CV6p1g0">Jason Dittmer and Soren Larsen</a><em>, </em>I'm
		starting to put together for myself a sense of what is significant
		and, in turn, what matters about Canadian superheroes. What makes
		them heroes, or not so much heroes?  <img class="aligncenter
		size-medium wp-image-3853" alt="jeff-lemire"
		src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/jeff-lemire-
		300x152.jpg" width="300" height="152" />  In <em>Essex County</em>,
		our protagonist Lester wants to be a superhero; this desire is how he
		sublimates the loss of his mother, his feelings about his unknown
		father figure, and his anxiety about living with the uncle he barely
		knows. His fascination with superhero comics (at the annoyance of his
		uncle) and his vigilance against aliens gives his life a focus it
		won't find again until he discovers his talent for hockey. And <a
		title="#173 Men without Women:  Jeff Lemire’s Essex County, Hockey,
		and Mythical Canadian Masculinity"
		href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/07/02/173-men-without-women
		-jeff-lemires-essex-county-hockey-and-mythical-canadian-masculinity/"
		>as Peter points out in his <em>Essex County</em> post</a>, the
		obsession fuels his isolation: <blockquote>Lester appears to be so
		stunned by his orphaned state that any relationship is impossible. He
		can barely stand to eat dinner or watch a hockey game with his uncle.
		He retreats into his own solipsistic fantasy world of Power Man.
		Comic books are both the antidote to his despair and the cause of it:
		traumatised by his mother’s death, he wears a mask and a cape to
		school even though his school mates taunt him for it.</blockquote>
		But I think it's also protective. Lester is wounded; the only way he
		can promise himself he won't get hurt again is to remove the
		possibility of relationship or connection. The mocking of his peers
		is minor compared to the traumatic loss of his mother and the
		restructuring of his life with his uncle.  <a
		href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2.jpg"><img
		class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3854" alt="2"
		src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2-200x300.jpg
		" width="200" height="300" /></a>  Lester's identity as Power Man is
		protective. It is also about escape. As Power Man, he flies over
		Essex County and away from the farm that constrains him. The story
		opens with the choice between flying in his imagination or feeding
		the chickens in his quotidian life. That opening juxtaposition sets
		up the forces in Lester's life and suggests why he retreats into, as
		Peter terms it, this "solipsistic fantasy." The life of a superhero
		is often an isolated one -- they do good for mankind at the expense
		of having a whole life of their own -- and this isolation appeals to
		Lester.  But isolation is a choice Lester makes. He is able to forge
		connections. When he confesses to Jimmy that he is, in fact, a
		superhero, they bond over how seriously Jimmy takes Lester's
		imaginary world; it is this connection that Lester's uncle can never
		provide him with because he isn't able to connect with the idea of
		comics, superheroes, and aliens. It's all meaningless to him.  There
		is nothing particularly Canadian about Power Man. Lester doesn't
		fantasize being Captain Canuck. Superheroics here are not about
		fulfilling a national project or defining oneself in relation to the
		nation -- as Peter points out, that's the role of hockey. But Power
		Man allows Lester to get to hockey, where he can join the rest of the
		men in the community in defining his masculinity and identity in a
		way that they can relate to. His major battle as Power Man, where he
		destroys the alien spacecraft and avenges the "death" of Jimmy, leads
		directly to Lester trading in his cape and goggles for a hockey
		cards: the imaginary power of Power Man becomes the impotent power of
		the Maple Leafs. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
		href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/talesfarm_06
		.gif"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3855" alt="talesfarm_06"
		src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/talesfarm_06-
		697x1024.gif" width="488" height="717" /></a></p> In this scene,
		Jimmy orchestrates a final conflict for Power Man: first, in order to
		write himself out of Lester's life as per Ken's request; and second,
		to hand over his hockey card and, by extension, his identity to
		Lester. By forming a connection with Jimmy succeeding in this heroic
		task, Lester brings his need for the protective, escapist, and
		sustaining myth of Power Man. In the end, Lester takes the card from
		Jimmy and leaves his cape behind. And the only one who sees the
		transition, in its moment, <a title="#174 The Line in Jeff Lemire’s

		<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p
		class="p1">Jack Kirby’s writing came in for a lot of criticism in the
		1970s after he made the break from Marvel Comics to DC Comics. And as
		time has gone on, Kirby’s dialogue can increasingly be read as
		stilted, in an age where “believable” or failing that, witty
		interchange between characters is much prized. He is out of step with
		how culture has gone because he is so earnest in his writing.</p> <p
		class="p2">Due to their great success in the 1960s at Marvel Comics,
		which were credited to Stan Lee as writer and Kirby as artist, it is
		tempting to look at those comics,  compare them to Kirby’s later work
		and subtract the difference as being Lee’s contribution. There is
		much debate about who exactly was responsible for what though, as
		Gerard Jones states:</p> <p class="p2">“Stan turned to Jack Kirby and
		through a process now eternally obscured by competing stories – both
		men claimed to have had all the basic ideas first – introduced
		Fantastic Four” <i>(a)</i></p> <p class="p2">Traditional notions of
		what a writer and an illustrator do Kirby are surely too simplistic
		when applied to comics, as recounted by Ronin Ro:</p> <p
		class="p2">“When Stan saw the Surfer in his pages, he asked “Who the
		hell’s this?” “ I figured anybody as powerful as Galactus ought to
		have a herald who would go ahead of him and find planets,” Jack
		replied. “That’s a great idea!” <i>(b)</i></p> <p class="p2">Leaving
		aside the thorny issue of what exactly is meant by writer in these
		credits, amongst what one might assume to be the Lee contribution is
		snappy banter between characters, witty and self-knowing asides and a
		more general showman/ringmaster persona that he brought to the
		editorial side of his work.</p> <p class="p2">This leaves Kirby with
		imaginative design in characters and environments, dramatic pacing,
		and a smaller or greater element of the plot depending on how
		detailed initial instruction from Lee was.</p> <p class="p2">By the
		time Kirby is doing the writing and drawing at DC, the imaginative
		characters, locations and plots are intact (arguably even more so),
		and the action and story progression is still very dynamic. What has
		been lost is a street level, smart-talking point of entry. Lee’s
		writing was done in reaction to Kirby’s artwork. In a sense he was
		commenting on what Kirby had created in the artwork.</p> <p
		class="p2">Kirby was always interested in creating new characters,
		situations and environments. In the late 60s, he proposed his New
		Gods ideas to Marvel, who didn’t want to use them. He took them to
		rivals DC instead.</p> <p class="p2">Kirby often used Gods, or
		variations on powerful celestial beings, in his stories. His
		contention that he, and not Lee, came up with the idea to do comics
		based on Norse mythology gains credence from the fact that Kirby had
		already done a version of Thor at DC in 1957 before doing it for
		Marvel in 1962.</p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b> <a

		who thinks Kirby could not deliver on an emotional level would be
		mistaken. Just look at this one panel from Mister Miracle
		…</span></p> <p class="p2"><a

		melodramatic, but even without any context, you have the sense of
		what Oberon (on the left) is feeling in this picture.</span></p> <p
		class="p1"><span class="s1">When Kirby returned to Marvel in the mid
		70s, his contract afforded him the opportunity to officially write,
		draw and edit his own books, a condition that Lee was willing to
		capitulate to in order to get Kirby back. He set to work on
		Eternals…</span></p> <p class="p2"><a
		href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Kirby-
		Eternals.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3637"

		/></a></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Kirby, Eternals, Marvel
		Comics, 1976</b></span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kirby was
		keen to create more new stories, characters and situations, in
		opposition to what had become the Marvel norm, whereby all the comics
		fed into each other to varying extents (all characters in Marvel
		Comics  had to meet Spider-Man at some point, be they Howard the
		Duck, Transformers or the Frankenstein monster).  Kirby did not want
		to create stories which had to negotiate through the convoluted
		continuity of twenty or so years of previously published comics. As
		Sean Howe writes, </span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">“In
		Captain America, assistant editor Roger Stern had to rewrite a Kirby
		reference to a flying saucer being “the first alien space craft ever
		to visit the Earth, “ a description that would discount scores of
		Marvel adventures and not a few of the characters.”
		<i>(c)</i></span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I only later
		read any of the background on Kirby’s self-penned comics. Summing up
		the industry view of him at this point, Mark Evanier
		writes:</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Just then, he’d
		stopped beoing Jack Kirby, the guy who created, or co-created, so
		many successful new comics. With the end of his contract in sight, he
		was Jack Kirby, the guy who did those wonky, unreadable books that
		didn’t sell so great.”<i>(d)</i></span></p> <p class="p1"><span
		class="s1">Evanier also writes:</span></p> <p class="p1"><span
		class="s1">“Years after, his seventies work would be regarded more
		favourably, and even reprinted, right along with everything else he
		did, time and again. Some would even say the sales figures weren’t as
		dour as the rumours of the times insisted”. <i>(d)</i></span></p> <p
		class="p1"><span class="s1">Anecdotally, I bought and read them.
		Perhaps there is a generational element to one’s appreciation of
		Kirby’s writing. The late 1970s Captain America were actually the
		first comics I read by Kirby, and I thought they were terrific as a
		kid. Instead of the wry, slightly arch dialogue of Lee though, in
		Kirby’s self-scripted comics we instead have an earnest, almost
		poetic series of statements. These are sentences that no-one has ever
		said or ever will say. They are not capturing a realistic
		conversational tone, they are lines which aspire to be about the
		magical, the fantastic, the wonderful. In this respect they are more
		in tune with the artwork. The totality of the comic is now Jack
		Kirby.</span></p> <p class="p2"><a

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is superb! A thousand thank yous. I
		run the "Great American Novel" web site on the Fantastic Four,
		devoted to the premise that the early FF works as a single superb
		novel. I'm currently gathering materials on Jack Kirby as a writer,
		because the more I study the more I have to see Stan Lee as a kind of
		music producer - someone who will suggest commercial ideas, autotune
		the results and market the hell out of a song, but Kirby was the
		singer-songwriter. Producers are often more important and talented
		than the stars, so calling Stan a producer is no insult, and does not
		diminish his contribution. But to me, as somebody obsessed with the
		bigger story, with the larger themes, the writing that matters is one
		hundred percent Kirby.

	Your essay encapsulates so much of what I want to say. But I could not
find the best part to quote - I want to quote it all. Then I saw the Creative
Commons licence and I am grinning from ear to ear. Thank you
again.]]></wp:comment_content> <wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">One of the
British Columbia towns I grew up in was Trail, home of the glorious Smoke
Eaters hockey team that won the World Championship in 1939 and 1961 and
competed for the Allan Cup, the pinnacle of senior men's hockey in Canada. In
my early teens going to Smokies games was the primary winter weekend
entertainment. The players worked in the Cominco smelter during the week and
assumed the heroic mantle of hockey stars on the weekends in the Western
International Hockey League, playing against teams like The Spokane Jets and
The Kimberley Dynamiters. The league was full of players who had played a few
games in the NHL and who might play in the NHL one day.</p>  When my minor
hockey team played on a Friday afternoon, we could smell the fat being heated
up for the evening Smoke Eaters game's chips. The hockey was vital and
violent, and with every game you felt the history of the city permeating
events, with the great stars from 1961, most of them children of Italian
immigrants, and the great stars of the future, like Ray Ferraro, in
attendance. I'm sure there were people in Trail who didn't like hockey, but
on game night it felt like everyone was there, with the hardcore fans
standing and smoking behind the last row of wooden plank seats.

	Senior hockey is dead in the Kootenays now along with much of the
mythical power of hockey in Canada, the Smoke Eaters exist only as a junior
hockey team, and the NHL is an antiseptic, dreary league with the exception
of a few sparks in the playoffs, when the rules change (largely by
disappearing).

	Jeff Lemire’s <em>Essex County</em> took me back to the mythical world of
Canadian hockey with startling clarity and made me reflect on the way that
Canadian identity has been so wrapped up in the masculine sacrifice of the
heroes of our national game. Apart from Chester Brown's <em>Louis Riel</em>,
perhaps, <em>Essex County</em> is the most Canadian comic book I have read,
largely because of the place of hockey in the LeBeuf masculine family
lineage. And it is an especially masculine family lineage; like classic
Disney films, Essex County kills off mothers.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/My-mom-died-last-
year.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3806"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/My-mom-died-last-year
.jpg" alt="My mom died last year" width="1024" height="768" /></a>

	The crux of the story is that Lester Papineau does not know that Jimmy
LeBeuf, the former hockey player who works at the local Esso gas station, is
his father. Jimmy played one game with the Toronto Maple Leafs. In that game
he scored a goal and was then hit so hard that it not only ended his brief
career but also left him "not quite right" ever since. Lester lives on a farm
with his uncle. Jimmy is supposed to stay away from Lester, for reasons that
Lemire conceals--something to do with his treatment of Lester’s mother
Claire--but forms a bond with him when Lester buys superhero comics from the
gas station. When they meet at the creek, Jimmy is willing to participate in
Lester's alien invasion fantasies and appreciate his self-drawn comics.

	Lemire’s drawing style in Essex county seems to identify both with
Jimmy’s post-injury state of mind and Lester’s bereft orphanhood. His lines
look like they were drawn by a really talented person drawing with his wrong
hand. The lines, which appear barely in control and highly skilled at the
same time, carry the suffering of the characters, particularly the hockey
playing men. Jimmy's face conveys a depth of longing and despair: his eyes
are wider apart than they should be, and his nose looks like it was carved
out of rock. This is the face of of the hockey player as it exists in the
Canadian imagination, tough, knocked about.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Spearfishin.jpg"><
img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3807"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Spearfishin.jpg"
alt="Spearfishin'" width="1024" height="768" /></a>

	Jimmy’s “man-child” aspect and his ability to identify with Lester’s
superhero fantasies capture the out-of-touch with reality masculinity of
Essex County. On the one hand, lies the world of mundane work at the gas
station, driving street cars, working the farm. On the other lies the
imaginary realm of hockey, where spectacular feats of heroism are possible,
but with huge risks, as Jimmy’s state indicates. His great uncle Lou also had
to leave the game with a wrecked knee. But Jimmy tells Lester that he is
mystified when people talk as if his one game in the NHL was the worst day of
his life when in fact, in his mind, it was the best. Playing that game and
scoring that goal was worth the addled brain that followed.

	A character like Vince, Jimmy’s grandfather, is an oddity. A talented
player who could make it to the NHL, he gives up the game cheerfully for
domestic bliss and life on the farm, for which he is punished by the death of
his wife and daughter in a car crash that Jimmy somehow survives. Indeed,
<em>Essex County</em> strands its male characters. Lemire isolates them and
draws their pain. The orphan as literary figure exemplifies masculine
self-determination and freedom. Without parents to guide his upbringing or
provide genetic comparisons, the orphan creates himself through his choices
and actions, the perfect existentialist. But the flipside of orphanhood is
loneliness and disconnection.

	Lou LeBeuf, who appears to have no sexual relationship apart from a one
night stand with his brother’s wife, Beth, expresses the plight of the
individual as disconnected atom. He says that there are two ways to be
absolutely alone: in the middle of a crowd or in total isolation. But this
isolation seems unnecessary. Why choose it?

	Lester appears to be so stunned by his orphaned state that any
relationship is impossible. He can barely stand to eat dinner or watch a
hockey game with his uncle. He retreats into his own solipsistic fantasy
world of Power Man. Comic books are both the antidote to his despair and the
cause of it: traumatised by his mother’s death, he wears a mask and a cape to
school even though his school mates taunt him for it.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/you-listening-to-me-
.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3812"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/you-listening-to-me-.
jpg" alt="you listening to me?" width="1024" height="768" /></a>

	Once again, hockey acts as the saviour: Lester’s success as a hockey
player buys him status, just as it has done for his father, grandfather, and
great uncle. It doesn’t buy him social or familial connection though.

	It’s curious that Lemire is so adamant about denying his male characters
such connection. The gender politics of <em>Essex County</em> are decidedly
odd. Relations with women, in the conventional sexual social sense, offer a
way out of masculine isolation but the male characters either do not choose
that path or get punished for it if they do, like Vince,  and homosexuality
doesn’t even seem like a possibility for these solitary, haunted, regretful
men.

	What these characters seek, perhaps, is a comprehensible affective
relationship with each other: Fathers, sons, and brothers. The barrier
between Jimmy and Lester and the disharmony between Lou and Vince LeBeuf
after Lou has sex with Vince’s wife Beth (there’s a lot of speculation that
Lou might be the father of Beth’s daughter and Jimmy’s father Mary.) Women
seem to interfere with these masculine relationships. Beth’s appearance on
the scene destroys Lou’s fantasy of he and Vince making it together in
hockey. His sexual dalliance with her is a form of revenge, perhaps.

	In fact, <em>Essex County</em> is structured around Lou LeBeuf’s
<em>ressentiment</em> towards Vince’s betrayal of hockey, Canada’s true totem
and merciless father. While Lou reflects warmly on the metaphorical
connection between hockey and family when he returns to the arena after years
of being a Toronto street car driver to be what Canadians affectionately call
a “rink rat,” someone who sharpens skates and drives the Zamboni, his
affection screens the fact that hockey cruelly sacrifices men like him and
Jimmy to drab, mundane work when physical ruination kills their heroic
aspirations.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/the-game-is-like-
family.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3809"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/the-game-is-like-
family.jpg" alt="the game is like family" width="527" height="761" /></a>

	We might argue that Lemire presents a feminine perspective on isolation
and orphanhood with Anne Byrne, the nurse who is the focus of Book Three, but
her story carries less weight and has less independence than that of the
LeBeufs and Papineaus because it is somewhat detached from the story arc that
runs through the three books. Anne is the return of the dead mother in the
form of a nurse: she looks after Lou LeBeuf in the nursing home, and she also
is the catalyst in a potential reconnection between Jimmy and Lester as
father and son. Her job in the narrative is to perform emergency triage on
these broken male characters, the sons of hockey, even as her own family
breaks down: her husband has died and her son is a resentful teenager.

	Because <em>Essex County</em> is more dependent on images than words,
it’s hard to tell whether it is critiquing or supporting the Canadian
ideology of masculine identification with, and sacrifice to, the game at the
expense of women.  Lemire’s graphic narrative is like Ernest Hemingway’s
writing in this regard: conventional masculine toughness is shot through with
frailty and weakness. And yet the male characters are so invested in their
own isolation, they can’t see any other way to be.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thank you for analysis.  When Lemire introduced
the country nurse it shows a good glimpse into how he viewed this town. Anne
meddles, and where she does so she quite literally attempts to heal more than
just the physical wounds of these guys.  Sure, she could be viewed as a plot
device, but we see plenty of her self-doubt in regards to her role, and also
her longing for more with her own family.

	Seen through the stay in the big city, isolation comes not from the town
itself, but from their self-infliction of it, and much of that stems from
keeping up the facade of masculinity.  Only Anne directly confronts her own
loneliness, and her meddling is needed to help the
others.]]></wp:comment_content> <wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[That frickin' bird. It
shows up everywhere in Jeff Lemire's <em>Essex County</em>. Its first
appearance is marked by a symbolic rather than literal representation: a
small boy trying to fly.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_01.png"><
img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_01-
1024x612.png" alt="wright_174_01" width="1024" height="612"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3824" /></a>

	It's a shadow really, a thick darkly drawn conflation of lines, flung
both by brush and narrative up into the heights. The oddly misshapen lines
reappear a little later in the narrative as the boy's shadow. It trails him
awkwardly as he awkwardly marches into the gas station to purchase a comic
from his as yet undiscovered father.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_01A.png">
<img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_01A-
1024x516.png" alt="wright_174_01A" width="1024" height="516"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3825" /></a>

	Finally, quite a ways into the narrative the literal bird appears on the
horizon, quite abruptly in terms of sequence, and gently touches down on the
barn where the boy has spent his time feeding the chickens and reading the
above mentioned comic to himself.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_01C.png">
<img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_01C-
659x1024.png" alt="wright_174_01C" width="659" height="1024"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3826" /></a>

	Birds appear elsewhere in <em>Book One: Tales from the Farm</em>, but
they tend to be chickens, and chickens can't fly. The metaphor here focuses
more on the typical circle of life stuff and the boy's inability to fly away
from his situation.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_chickens.
png"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_chickens.
png" alt="wright_174_chickens" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter
size-full wp-image-3827" /></a>

	The chickens here are frequently connected to the cross, a harkening back
to both the absence of religious practice and its yet still overbearing
presence in French-Canadian life, particularly that life from which the
"Papineau" clan is clearly descended despite being placed in Southern
Ontario--if we are indeed meant to call forward the real Essex County (a
topography of particulars).

	Crosses to bear are with the grounded chickens, but the bird, that
shadowed, thick, darkly drawn lined bird mentioned above, connected to the
boy, is a distorted version. A kind of off-kilter, slanted, gangly, disturbed
cross and it is most often identifiable by the lines--both the drawn lines
and narrative lines--it introduces. Its trajectory is always outwards, a
perspective of lines pushing outward to a finite point on the horizon and a
widening foreground. That bird also runs throughout the <em>Essex County</em>
narrative, overseeing its progression and guiding its evolution. It, like the
comic itself, is made up of and represented through the line.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_pov3.png"
><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_pov3-
771x1024.png" alt="wright_174_pov3" width="771" height="1024"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3835" /></a>

	Lemire's bird and the lines it both represents and oversees speak to
topography, loosely the study and description of landscapes or shapes
themselves--the features, measures, distinctions that mark borders, heights,
nuances. It's also a branch of study that focuses on local detail, and how
those local features might suggest local histories or cultures. Topography is
a bird's science; a kind of "zoom in / zoom out" approach to understanding
how space gets filled in relative to other filled in spaces. Most often, we
think of topography in cartographic terms--those lines on a map that suggest
distinctions such as hills, valleys, trees, pathways, and objects.

	A bald example is <em>Essex County's</em> family tree. There are several
devices of the topographical line in here. One is the bird's downward and
orderly trajectory through the family tree itself, telling us how to read and
layout a topology for the narrative. Another is the gradual fade of the drawn
line as the background image of the face degrades and lines are added to
represent both age and a buildup of life experiences--the line as a topology
of time.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_nostalgia
.png"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_nostalgia-
739x1024.png" alt="wright_174_nostalgia" width="739" height="1024"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3829" /></a>

	The faded and accumulated line frequently invokes resonance: connections
to the past, the single-lined innocence of youth versus the collected,
varicose veined line of age and experience, missing or faded memory,
nostalgia--as if missing lines mean something and so does too many lines, too
many connections. The line then functions as a topology for meaning.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/
wright_174_nostalgia2.png"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_nostalgia2
-715x1024.png" alt="wright_174_nostalgia2" width="715" height="1024"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3830" /></a>

	This emphasis on the line seems central to any poetics for comics. Any
critique of comics must necessarily focus on the line as 1) metaphoric
connection to the past, a literal harkening back to the lines of Kubert,
Tardis, Eisner, Crumb (and so many others: Picasso, Rembrandt, DE Vinci
dammit!) and the different topologies their lines--those distinct, always
identifiable lines--represent; and 2) as central to the reading of symbols,
narrative, and stories that unfold in a graphic situation.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_pov-1.png
"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_pov-1-
768x1024.png" alt="wright_174_pov-1" width="768" height="1024"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3831" /></a>

	The image above suggests another way that Lemire asserts topologies: the
tilted and shifting frames that separate the narrative and at times the
action itself. These lines, contrary to typical comics form, are often tilted
or cocked at an angle. This transcendent line, slanted and uneven, tilts like
a curious bird's eye, perspective always slightly off-balance, darting,
blinking, curious. As if we, and the narrative we see unravelling before us,
were perched precariously on a wire observing the landscapes below. We are
reading these lines from a shifting, curious, unstable, topologic perspective
that zooms in and zooms out, looks down and looks up. We wander in and out of
perspective teetering and tottering through the comic frame, itself a
topological framework for the line.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_pov-1A.
png"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_pov-1A-
768x1024.png" alt="wright_174_pov-1A" width="768" height="1024"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3832" /></a>

	These shifting topological frames are broken and transcended. The
topology of place--Essex County--remains static while the bird motions
through it, pushing the narrative forward, pushing time onward, and forcing
the narrative outward into other spaces away from a place of origin but
always that place--Essex County--remains in the background, its perspective
etched in lines out (or in) toward a finite horizon. Contrarily, the bird
rises, a figure of outward as Charles Olson would suggest, and moves off the
page.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wright_174_pov1A.png

694x1024.png" alt="wright_174_pov1A" width="694" height="1024"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3833" /></a>

	This action is, too, fractured by the line. The telephone pole shadows in
the spread below recall the elevated point of view above, mimicking the
tilted comic frames which have now become both artificial borders and
simulacrum that separate and recall the literal shadowed topographical,
networked, lines that lead both outward and inward, back and forth, in and
out of Essex County.

	In Lemire's collection, we are always disconnected, reconnected,
unconnected and connected by lines. These connections can move away from us
or toward us, into the horizon or away from the foreground--a topology of
connection.

	The final frame of <em>Essex County</em> again shows the bird. But, is
the bird coming or going? How are we to read this? The bird is so evenly
placed that we cannot read this. We have only lines and these lines tell us
we can go either way. Are the lines on the "Leaving Essex County" sign
indicative of a sunset or a sunrise? These unknowns; a topology of ambiguity.
<!--also, something should be said about the inherent racism in Lemire's
linear representations. The line suggests more subtle things than surfaces.
It also sugget big noses and other indicators or colonialism and normative
representation. -->

	The yield here is how <em>Essex County's</em> bird tells / shows us how
to read a comic through the line. Connections back and connections forward.
Thick, aggressive blotched lines and elegant straight lines; faded, vacuous
lines; bunched, scribbled, unsteady lines. It suggests we need to look more
stridently at how the line reflects both a hinge to the construction of
narrative and the creative mark that the line represents to the artist. What
strikes about <em>Essex County</em> when one reads it in context is how
confidently it represents Lemire's line--from hockey histories (see picture
of author), Canadian places, French-Canadian names, to the work of Crumb,
Tardis, and the irreverence of Reza Farazmand. In short, the book suggests
that the line is foundational for critiquing comics and that <em>Essex
County</em> is our first real bright example of a topography of comics. Now,
we must hunt among stones.<!-- an allusion to Charles Olson's "The
Kingfishers" -->

		<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have to
		confess a certain disappointment with Jeff Lemire of late.

	This isn't entirely fair. The people I should be disappointed with are
the folks at DC Comics, but since I'm quite literally always disappointed
with everything DC does, that's not any fun.

	[gallery ids="3849,3847,3846"]

	You see, Jeff Lemire took over <em>Justice League of America</em>
recently with the intent to relaunch it as <em>Justice League Canada</em> and
I, <em>Alpha Flight</em> super fan and part-time Professional Canadian, was
pretty flipping excited. But then, the news changed: there would be no
<em>Justice League Canada</em>; instead, "Justice League Canada" became the
first story arc of <em>Justice League United</em> (in Canada, we got Justice
League Canada covers anyway, because pandering), and instead of my dreamed-of
nouveau <em>Alpha Flight</em>, we got a typical (kind of boring*) Justice
League story set in Canada. To Lemire's credit, this is more like
when <em>Alpha Flight</em> went to Calgary than when <em>Archie</em> went to
Vancouver: the geography of Moosonee / Moose Factory actually matters to the
narrative. But there's a feeling of tokenism here. Adam Strange is Canadian
now for... reasons? And while I applaud the inclusion of Equinox and the
decision to make her a Cree teenager (this is <em>good</em>, DC -- more of
this!), it's hard not to feel like she will fade to black once this run comes
to an end, because the storyline is not spectacular enough for me to think
she'll take flight.

	The disappointment I feel at not getting my very own DC version
of <em>Alpha Flight</em> is profound. This feels like when the comics
atrocity that was <em>Omega Flight</em> happened at the end of <em>Civil
War</em> and all my beloved <em>Alpha Flight</em> characters died. Why is it
so hard to make Canadian superheroes stick in a global context?<em> </em>

	So when I reread <em>Essex County</em> for this week's Graphixia** post,
I did so with all these questions about Canada and superheroes and what it
means to represent the nation in a Canadian context.

width="240" height="240" /></a> I feel the red cape is poignant because
Canada.[/caption]

	This has informed a lot of my thinking about Canadian comics, generally,
ever since fellow Graphixian Peter and I decided to read <em>Scott
Pilgrim</em> as a superhero comic that inverts and challenges expectations of
Canadian national identity. (Our work will be in the forthcoming <a
href="http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9781138025158/"><em>Representing
Multiculturalism in Comics and Graphic Novels</em></a>.) Drawing on the work
of scholars like <a
href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-5931.00063/abstract">
Ryan Edwardson</a>, <a
href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02722010609481401?
journalCode=rarc20#.U8597l6p1g0">Bart Beaty</a>, and <a
href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14649360701633311#.
U85_CV6p1g0">Jason Dittmer and Soren Larsen</a><em>, </em>I'm starting to put
together for myself a sense of what is significant and, in turn, what matters
about Canadian superheroes. What makes them heroes, or not so much heroes?

	<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3853" alt="jeff-lemire"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/jeff-lemire-300x152.
jpg" width="300" height="152" />

	In <em>Essex County</em>, our protagonist Lester wants to be a superhero;
this desire is how he sublimates the loss of his mother, his feelings about
his unknown father figure, and his anxiety about living with the uncle he
barely knows. His fascination with superhero comics (at the annoyance of his
uncle) and his vigilance against aliens gives his life a focus it won't find
again until he discovers his talent for hockey. And <a title="#173 Men
without Women:  Jeff Lemire’s Essex County, Hockey, and Mythical Canadian
Masculinity"
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/07/02/173-men-without-women-jeff-
lemires-essex-county-hockey-and-mythical-canadian-masculinity/">as Peter
points out in his <em>Essex County</em> post</a>, the obsession fuels his
isolation: <blockquote>Lester appears to be so stunned by his orphaned state
that any relationship is impossible. He can barely stand to eat dinner or
watch a hockey game with his uncle. He retreats into his own solipsistic
fantasy world of Power Man. Comic books are both the antidote to his despair
and the cause of it: traumatised by his mother’s death, he wears a mask and a
cape to school even though his school mates taunt him for it.</blockquote>
But I think it's also protective. Lester is wounded; the only way he can
promise himself he won't get hurt again is to remove the possibility of
relationship or connection. The mocking of his peers is minor compared to the
traumatic loss of his mother and the restructuring of his life with his
uncle.

	<a href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3854" alt="2"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2-200x300.jpg"
width="200" height="300" /></a>

	Lester's identity as Power Man is protective. It is also about escape. As
Power Man, he flies over Essex County and away from the farm that constrains
him. The story opens with the choice between flying in his imagination or
feeding the chickens in his quotidian life. That opening juxtaposition sets
up the forces in Lester's life and suggests why he retreats into, as Peter
terms it, this "solipsistic fantasy." The life of a superhero is often an
isolated one -- they do good for mankind at the expense of having a whole
life of their own -- and this isolation appeals to Lester.

	But isolation is a choice Lester makes. He is able to forge connections.
When he confesses to Jimmy that he is, in fact, a superhero, they bond over
how seriously Jimmy takes Lester's imaginary world; it is this connection
that Lester's uncle can never provide him with because he isn't able to
connect with the idea of comics, superheroes, and aliens. It's all
meaningless to him.

	There is nothing particularly Canadian about Power Man. Lester doesn't
fantasize being Captain Canuck. Superheroics here are not about fulfilling a
national project or defining oneself in relation to the nation -- as Peter
points out, that's the role of hockey. But Power Man allows Lester to get to
hockey, where he can join the rest of the men in the community in defining
his masculinity and identity in a way that they can relate to. His major
battle as Power Man, where he destroys the alien spacecraft and avenges the
"death" of Jimmy, leads directly to Lester trading in his cape and goggles
for a hockey cards: the imaginary power of Power Man becomes the impotent
power of the Maple Leafs. <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/talesfarm_06.gif"><
img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3855" alt="talesfarm_06"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/talesfarm_06-697x1024
.gif" width="488" height="717" /></a></p> In this scene, Jimmy orchestrates a
final conflict for Power Man: first, in order to write himself out of
Lester's life as per Ken's request; and second, to hand over his hockey card
and, by extension, his identity to Lester. By forming a connection with Jimmy
succeeding in this heroic task, Lester brings his need for the protective,
escapist, and sustaining myth of Power Man. In the end, Lester takes the card
from Jimmy and leaves his cape behind. And the only one who sees the
transition, in its moment, <a title="#174 The Line in Jeff Lemire’s Essex

thoroughly in his post</a>.

	* Kind of boring might not be fair. We're only a few issues in. But so
far: pretty boring. What is it about DC Comics that makes me want to nap in
my chair? Hashtag Marvel girl.

	** I am so freaking happy to have all Graphixians riffing on a single
topic again. I don't understand why we ever <em>don't</em> do
this.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Jeff Lemire is
something of a chameleon – unlike most of comics’ author / illustrators, he
never seems to shy away from a particular genre in the medium. My exposure to
his work has been predominantly through his efforts with DC comics in
<i>Animal Man</i>, <i>Sweet Tooth</i>, the recent (and very underrated)
<i>Trillium</i> and (the sadly not underrated enough) <i>Justice League
United</i>. More superhero oriented, these series show him to have a nuanced
interpretation of protagonists in his creation of deeply flawed characters
and problematic relationships; but instead of trying to find ideals, as most
superhero stories do, he reminds us of the import of subjectivity in the
human experience and that one’s interpretation of heroism depends on what’s
needed in one’s life at the time. This approach oddly makes it easier to
identify with his stories, regardless of how farfetched some of them might
be, as his characterization and thematic development are gritty, morose and
(like his art at points, as Peter pointed out) ugly.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/essex_county-722666.
jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3864"
alt="essex_county-722666"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/essex_county-722666-
224x300.jpg" width="224" height="300" /></a>Lemire’s much lauded Canadiana
trilogy <i>Essex County</i> deals with these concepts writ large through
shattering - and ultimately broadening - our concept of what it means to be a
member of a family. The story is suggestive of multiple approaches to
identity formation that allow the reader to choose which motivator Lemire
thinks is most important as influenced by outside forces (though he certainly
takes nurture over nature for granted). The most obvious of these, almost
cloyingly so, is through nationalistic pursuits. When reading <i>Essex
County</i>, it’s easy to see its glaring focus on what it means to be
Canadian through stereotypes that oddly hit home – the LeBeufs are very much
a hockey family, and they quite clearly derive their understanding of
heroism, masculinity and identity through the sport (the alternative we’re
presented with, almost as Canadian, is the Papineau family whose identity
comes from working the land). Most of the interactions reference hockey in
some way, even when the focus is on a lack of interaction; when Lester denies
his uncle some much needed family time in front of a Bruins game, he still
heads downstairs to watch Hockey Night in Canada on his own. <i>Essex County
</i>is so Canadian that it will allow its characters isolation from bloodline
yet not from its national pastime, almost as if doing so would be too
farfetched. That young Lester looks for identity in heroism through hockey is
unsurprising, however, as he can’t find it anywhere else in his life – every
other character he encounters is reluctant or damaged or both. Lou, his
unsung father, is a stereotypical hockey playing Canadian who almost made it
save for the fact that he has been crippled and made simple through an
accident on the ice – an accident that reveals Lou is so Canadian that he
cannot force himself to regret the injury – and who Lester looks to as a
father figure seemingly only because of his past abilities in the rink. <p
style="text-align: left;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/jeff-lemire.jpg"><
img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3853" alt="jeff-lemire"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/jeff-lemire-300x152.
jpg" width="300" height="152" /></a>Lester pursues identity through drawing
comic books as well, creating his inspiring heroes instead of looking for
them in his environment – and there is a sort of crossover here, as in
Lester’s superhero fantasies that involve Jimmy, he’s always dressed in his
hockey uniform to mirror the cape and mask that Lester himself wears.
Spending his youth in costume, Lester seeks heroism through his own actions
as well; however, he eventually gives this up to continue his drawing,
creating fictions to mask the flaws he finds in his rural reality that he
attempts to share with others, attempting to establish connection through
storytelling. Nationalism through hockey and superheroes in <i>Essex
County</i> becomes the safety net that catches us when blood fails – Lester,
Jimmy, Mary and nearly every other character in the narrative lacks an
understanding of their lineage. Familial paths cross consistently in the
County, however these are serendipitous and normally go unacknowledged by the
characters themselves. Lester’s chance meeting of his great uncle (or perhaps
his grandfather, we’re never quite sure as Lemire implies one lineage through
his dialogue and another through his art) in a snow covered field in the
country dark is extremely revealing of this – neither is aware of who the
other is, and both are struggling to find themselves either through the
circular process of “going home” and “running away” (319).</p> <p
style="text-align: left;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/essex1.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3863" alt="essex1"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/essex1.jpg"
width="413" height="591" /></a>The tragedy here is that both verbally
acknowledge that they shouldn’t be alone when doing so, but neither offers to
help the other – each instead heads on his own way. There is a bitter irony
here, and a scathing criticism of our need to find ourselves solely through
ourselves; <i>Essex County</i> is not a story of missed but <i>ignored</i>
connections, and every character suffers because of it.</p> So when blood
fails to help his characters find comfort or identity, Lemire suggests
history instead, tracing back several generations of Essex County’s
collective past. There is something of a revelation in his depiction, as he
re-humanizes history from its frequent glossing over as a collection of rote
facts: in his formation of the County over a hundred years prior, as
everywhere, there is as much ambiguity of parentage and familial identity as
there is in its present. As Dave points out, however, the only omniscience in
the story comes in the form of the bird, an icon of the natural world that
carries the truth of our lineages because there is too much uncertainty in
our brief lives to do so ourselves - trying to do so is overwhelming. We see
this again and again in <em>Essex County</em>, poignantly in the repeated
image of the river and the events that take place over the centuries both on
its shores and in the hockey games on the river itself when it freezes over.
When Lou, trying to reconnect with his brother and family line, submerges
himself here, he chokes and becomes lost in its depths:  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/essex.gif"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3862" alt="essex"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/essex.gif"
width="750" height="1020" /></a>  The river as a natural image connecting
generations might be a bit cliche, but here Lemire works it quite well in
showing that it's too powerful for us to ever really make use of in any
productive way. All we have is the cultural moment in which to pursue
ourselves and make meaningful connections with others. History, if only
because of its scope, fails to be able to allow us to come to terms with
identity.  When we are introduced to hockey at the beginning of the graphic
novel, it seems as if it’s a poor substitute for history, family, identity,
aspiration and life in general. However by casting a dark pallor over the
rest of his characters’ lives (not the least of which lies in the fraternal
betrayal that results in dubious parentage), it becomes by comparison a
necessary component of what it means to be Canadian and, more generally, a
human being. And this seems to be what Lemire is driving at: identity and
family are flawed concepts at best, and we need to find solace in
nationalistic, collective pursuits if we’re to find anything at all. This
realization seems to be unironic and ultimately satisfactory in attempting to
find oneself – a fact that is underscored by a photo of Lemire as a young boy
in a hockey uniform for the “about the author” final page of the collected
edition of <em>Essex County</em>.  What we are left with are Lemire’s
typically flawed characters, driven to self imposed isolation, unknowingly
connected through their landscape and blood but consciously connected through
nationalistic pursuits. The reader understands the fragile, tenuous
connections between these quiet lives in a way that the characters themselves
never will, much in the same way that in our own lives we can’t see through
the mesh of subjectivity that isolates us and divorces us from an
understanding of our larger role in a historical, linear context. But it’s
there nonetheless, and the roots of Canadian culture run as deep in <i>Essex
County</i> as they ostensibly do in the rest of the country, even if they are
too deep to be consciously perceived. We connect with others instead through
the seemingly surface stories and stats of hockey and superheroes, and that
might be why these stories are such an improbably important part of our
culture. Narratives of heroism, through hockey or otherwise, are simply more
easily understood and shared. One might find this a humble, sad testament,
but Lemire’s story of a fractured family line that ultimately comes (sort of)
together shows that these more surface stories don’t create connections but
instead <i>reveal</i> them, even if we don’t understand their complexities.
They create a common language that gives us an excuse to express ourselves,
to establish our identities and ultimately to love one another even against
difficult odds.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[After I read <i>Essex
County</i> for the first time last month, following Peter’s first post about
it, I tweeted that I saw Jeff Lemire as “The Raymond Carver of Comics.” It’s
not always that valuable to make such cross-form comparisons, but it’s not a
comparison I made lightly, and I think it hints at shared qualities that
reveal something about our understanding of the central elements of comics –
time and space as rendered in images, text and panels – and how Jeff Lemire
puts them to use in <i>Essex County</i>. It’s also a comparison made by
Darwyn Cooke in his introduction to the collected edition, which I skipped on
my first reading but was pleased to note when I re-read the book in
preparation for this post. “With a casual grace that would make the late
Raymond Carver envious,” writes Cooke, “Lemire’s stories build out of
innocuous and seemingly unconnected moments that gather and gain weight when
viewed in a cumulative light.” (5)  Lemire’s talent for the subtle, for the
expert rendering of that which lies beneath the surface, has been discussed
in this series already. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/07/02/173-men-without-women-jeff-
lemires-essex-county-hockey-and-mythical-canadian-masculinity/">Peter
Wilkins</a> and <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/07/28/176-the-roots-of-canadian-
identity-in-lemires-essex-county/">Scott Marsden</a> have both examined
Lemire’s treatment of Canadian identity, which is the all-consuming backdrop
of <i>Essex County</i> and an undeniably influential presence, running
throughout the book’s narrative; <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/07/15/174-the-line-in-jeff-lemires-
essex-county-a-topographic-poetics-for-comics/">David N. Wright</a> discussed
Lemire’s lines, and reminded us of “how the line reflects both a hinge to the
construction of narrative and the creative mark that the line represents to
the artist”; and <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/07/22/175-canadian-superheroics-in-
jeff-lemires-essex-county/">Brenna Clarke Gray</a> discussed Canadian
superheroics, pitting Lester’s made-up alter ego Power Man against his
humdrum rural reality, his cape masking his own fear and the trauma of his
mother’s death.  As is often the case with analyses of Carver, and similar
writers such as Alice Munro (whose Canadian landscapes I also felt were
echoed in <i>Essex County</i>), looking at and understanding <i>Essex
County</i> is as much about what is not said and what is not told, as what
is. Perhaps more so. “What is not said” applies equally to the images as it
does to the text and the dialogue – perhaps, as we’re looking at a comic, we
can think of “what is not drawn.” This can extend not just to whatever
elements of a depicted scene we perceive to be significantly absent, but to
Lemire’s visual style and the choices made in inking, line thickness, and the
interplay between black and white, as well as his overall decision to work in
black and white, which is likely to be significantly informed by his own
time, resources and finances as a cartoonist working alone in this instance,
but still can be seen as a decision in keeping with the overall feel of
<i>Essex County</i>. What is not said and what is not drawn work together as
an imagetext, creating a subtle and unique portrait of Canadian life and
Canadian identity.  Lemire’s visual style is the key to this symbiosis. His
lines are often ratty, like Gary Panter working on a larger scale with more
breathing room. The brushstrokes of Lemire’s inking are broad, and he’s not
afraid to use them to cast long shadows, a regular occurrence which results
in them becoming a motif for the hidden, the unspoken. Bodies are somewhat
angular, particularly their faces, in which eyes are mostly small black
circles, hinting at the depth and pain in the characters’ minds behind them
but giving little away. Cross-hatching is often eschewed in favour of large
black spaces and black fills, emphasizing the shape of objects and elements
as opposed to the detail interiors – again, the reader is shown simple
exteriors, left to extrapolate and imagine and speculate on what lies beneath
and inside the shapes and lines on the surface of the objects.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Essex-County-12.jpg"
><img class="size-full wp-image-3873 aligncenter" alt="Essex County 12"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Essex-County-12.jpg"
width="445" height="653" /></a>  In the above, for example, the sky beneath
Lester as he imagines himself flying away from the farm where he lives with
his uncle is almost literally a blank canvas – nothing but white space,
unencumbered by details that could have been included, such as clouds or
other textures. Lester’s desire to escape from his farmhouse is clear, of
course, from the fact that he is speeding away from it. His body fills the
majority of the first panel and breaks the frames, hinting at freedom briefly
before he is again constrained by a full panel at the moment his uncle calls
his name. Again, besides Lester’s figure and the dialogue, there is nothing
in this panel except white space, leaving his uncle’s calling to take the
place of the background. We are given only one word and no visual backdrop –
so much is not said, and so much is not drawn, but from this we are given a
portrait of the emptiness and bleakness of Lester’s life, of the silence of
rural Canada which permeates throughout <i>Essex County</i>.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Essex-County-333.jpg
"><img class="size-full wp-image-3874 aligncenter" alt="Essex County 333"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Essex-County-333.jpg"
width="446" height="641" /></a>  Similarly, in the above image there is much
said and much we can extrapolate from the silence and from what is not drawn.
The Canadian landscape viewed from Lou’s porch is reduced to his deck and a
few short, clipped brushstrokes, carrying with them the weight of his family
history, invaded by the recurring presence of the crow, which speaks a sole
“Kaw!” here, a rare communication with the characters, breaking its streak of
appearances outside the main narrative of the story where it exists largely
as an onlooker. This breaks, briefly, the feelings of detachment and distance
which are created by the silence in Lemire’s landscapes, bringing them home
to roost on Lou’s porch. The silence is also broken by the pt-pt-pt sound of
the crow’s feet on the ground, one of the few instances of verbal depiction
of sound in <i>Essex County</i>, which is also striking against the silent
backdrop established over the previous 300 pages.  Lou smiles back at the
crow, and then the chapter is finished. This exchange follows a series of
thought bubbles in which Lou tells himself “…there are only two ways to be
completely alone in this world…lost in a crowd…or in total isolation. And
here I am…alone again.” (331-332) As soon as he is finished thinking,
however, the crow appears to remind him that he is not alone, and his smile
and brief communication with the crow implies that he knows he is not alone,
that his Canadian life is not all silence, despite his initial assertions to
the contrary.  As with Carver, where much of the depicted world is silent,
that which breaks the silence finds great significance. It is in this aspect
of storytelling that Lemire excels, using such elements as the crow to
emphasise the positive messages hidden in the complex narratives of <i>Essex
County, </i>which can seem bleak at times. It is a comic characterized by
loneliness, and by silence – but it is not without warmth and not without
sound, and it is in the breaks in the silence that we find the heart of
Lemire’s <i>Essex County</i>.  Bibliography  Carver, Raymond.  <i>Will You

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have to confess that
I have struggled to write this <i>Essex County</i> post. The recent technical
glitches behind the scenes here at Graphixia played into my hands and delayed
my slot in this series. I also switched dates with Paddy as I was attending
the <a href="http://iawis.org/" target="_blank">International Association of
Word and Image Studies</a> conference the week it was due (Peter was there
too, it was great to catch up IRL). All these delays meant I could hold off
writing the post and quite frankly I was glad. Why? Well, I was not
particularly engaged by <i>Essex County</i>, in fact it would be fair to say
that I was underwhelmed. I was aware of the book and I might even have picked
it up in a shop before but I had filed it under ‘nothing to see here’ and
moved on. Unlike Hattie, the book was not sitting in my mental ‘to read’
file.

	So here I am, having read the book one and a half times and still feeling
indifferent towards it. Was it because, as <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/07/22/175-canadian-superheroics-in-
jeff-lemires-essex-county/" target="_blank">Brenna</a> suggested, I am just
not Canadian enough to get it? After all, Peter did say that it was “<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/07/02/173-men-without-women-jeff-
lemires-essex-county-hockey-and-mythical-canadian-masculinity/"
target="_blank">the most Canadian comic book</a>” he has ever read. As <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/08/26/178-the-one-where-hattie-
muses-on-whether-she-is-canadian-enough-to-enjoy-essex-county/"
target="_blank">Hattie</a> mentioned there is a lot of ice hockey in this
book, and I found that I got bored and easily distracted during the long
hockey episodes. When I returned to reading the book to write this post I did
not get past book two <i>Ghost Stories</i>, with its lengthy history of Lou
Lebeuf’s hockey playing youth (hence the half).

Swing</em> by James Sturm.[/caption]

	So maybe it was too Canadian, certainly if you define Canadian-ness by
its relationship to ice hockey. It occurs to me as I write this that the town
where I grew up is also home to <a href="http://www.fifeflyers.co.uk/"
target="_blank">Fife Flyers</a> one of the few ice hockey teams in Scotland.
Growing up I never felt any affinity to them or any desire watch them play,
so perhaps my indifference to ice hockey is longstanding. However, not liking
a sport does not mean that I cannot engage with a book in which it is
featured. <a
href="https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/press/2003/02/observer-reviews-sturms
-golem" target="_blank"><i>The Golem’s Mighty Swing</i></a> by James Sturm is
about an itinerant Jewish baseball team and it was still a great read.

alt="Excerpt from Darwyn Cooke's introduction." width="600" height="90"
/></a> Excerpt from Darwyn Cooke's introduction.[/caption]

	In Darwyn Cooke’s introduction he wants to distance <i>Essex County</i>
from being called ‘comics’. He refuses to use the term and even appears to
think labelling the book ‘graphic fiction’ or ‘graphic literature’ is not
good enough for a book with its lofty ambitions. This is ‘Canadian
Literature’ to be filed with Margarets Laurence and Atwood. This seems
hyperbolic to me, there is great desire in comics to insist that any
‘serious’ work should be deemed the equivalent of great literature. Can
comics not stand in their own field and have great (and terrible and
indifferent) works within the medium? Although I do think that Lemire is
consciously aiming for the territory that Cooke mentions. It feels like he
was trying too hard to create a Great (North) American novel. If you want a
book that does for comics what Margaret Atwood or Don Delillo (more baseball)
does for literature then I would suggest reading David Mazzucchelli’s <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/books/review/Wolk-t.html?_r=0"
target="_blank"><i>Asterios Polyp</i></a>.

	This attempt at being ‘Great Literature’ is only part of the reason that
<i>Essex County</i> does not work for me though. Listening to Dan Berry
interview <a
href="http://makeitthentelleverybody.com/2014/08/woodrow-phoenix/"
target="_blank">Woodrow Phoenix</a> in the latest <a
href="http://makeitthentelleverybody.com/" target="_blank"><i>Make It Then
Tell Everybody</i></a> podcast made think of other reasons. Berry and
Phoenix, creator of <a href="http://www.myriadeditions.com/rumble-strip"
target="_blank">Rumble Strip</a> and <a
href="http://blogs.city.ac.uk/ludiprice/2014/07/20/woodrow-phoenixs-she-lives
-a-fan-experience/" target="_blank">She Lives</a>, were discussing the
technicalities of comics production and the need for a book to have
‘something to say’ and not just look pretty. Phoenix stated that ‘if they
have something to say, even if they have rudimentary drawing skills, then
that is what I want to read.’ I generally agree with Phoenix’s comment but it
made me realise that another problem I have with <i>Essex County</i> is that
I don’t think the art in Lemire’s book is very good and this distances me
even more from the story. Often when writing about a comic the reviewer
discusses the plot, characterisation and storytelling without mentioning the
art. Many of my Graphixia colleagues have, thankfully, touched on the art
of<i> Essex County</i> even if only as a backhanded compliment. Peter said
that Lemire’s ‘lines look like they were drawn by a really talented person
drawing with his wrong hand,’ while <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/08/12/177-what-is-not-drawn/"
target="_blank">Paddy</a> describe his lines as being ‘ratty, like Gary
Panter working on a larger scale with more breathing room.’ I would go
further and say that the art is just bad.

	[caption id="attachment_3898" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/crow-p42.jpg"><img

alt="The crow, detail from page 42." width="600" height="444" /></a> The
crow, detail from page 42.[/caption]

	To start with lets look at at what <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/07/15/174-the-line-in-jeff-lemires-
essex-county-a-topographic-poetics-for-comics/" target="_blank">Dave calls
‘That frickin’ bird,’</a> the omniscient crow that appears throughout the
book. Every time I see that crow in the book I think to myself ‘has Lemire
ever seen a crow in real life?’ Lemire’s characters are a cartoony version of
reality but he makes an attempt at ‘realistic’ depiction, and the detail
inside school buses and hockey arenas suggests he has some real life
reference, but this crow is barely even a cartoon. It is a suggestion of a
crow, seemingly based on other cartoon versions of crows, and too far removed
from reality to make me believe that it is an actual crow.

	[caption id="attachment_3899" align="aligncenter" width="225"]<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sky.jpg"><img

alt="sky" width="225" height="300" /></a> Ink lines in the sky in <em>Essex
County</em>.[/caption]

	I am never fully convinced by Lemire’s brushwork either, it seems to
betray its own making too much. We can always tell what it has been painted
with. Lines in the sky appear to me to be just painted lines on a page.
Unlike, say, Oliver East’s most recent black and white work in <i>The
Homesick Truant's Cumbrian Yarn</i> where black ink scraped across the page
makes me believe that there is a foreboding sky in the background of his
panels. Lemire also does that illustrators trick of leaving little blobs of
ink on the page but I do not understand why. Unless he thinks that is what
comics illustrators do. I think there should be a reason for marks being
there, rather than just style.

Homesick Truant's Cumbrian Yarn</em> #1 by Oliver East[/caption]

	I have rambled on enough but on paper <i>Essex County </i>is everything I
like about comics. It is an independently published black and white story
about real life. It should be a straight win for me but somehow it does not
work, it seems empty. In <i>Make It Then tell Everybody</i> Woodrow Phoenix
stated that he believed that there is a contract with the reader and the
creator of a comic, where the creator agrees not to waste your time. If the
contract is fulfilled, even if you don’t like all of the book, it should
still be worth your time to read it. <i>Essex County</i> is certainly not the
worst comic in the world (by a margin) but I cannot decide whether that
contract was fulfilled or not.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[While <i>Comixology</i>
is the most familiar app for reading comics tablets, phones, and laptops, not
to mention for purchasing comics, I find myself turning to apps like
<i>Sequential </i>when searching through <i>Comixology</i> becomes too
overwhelming, which is often the case when looking for new, unfamiliar
titles.  <i>Comixology</i> has such a huge selection and is so dominated by
superhero comics that browsing for something that isn’t necessarily in the
mainstream of comics offerings can be challenging. Indeed, I often find
myself swiping through publishing house after publishing house on
<i>Comixology</i> and then giving up. I admit that I frequently just go to
Fantagraphics, but prices of $15-$20 a book make taking a flier on something
an expensive proposition. There’s such a thing as too much selection from my
point of view, one of the reasons I prefer to go to a local shop than a giant
supermarket.

	<i>Sequential</i> is the local shop to <i>Comixology</i>’s supermarket in
the online comics sales arena. Because <i>Sequential</i> does not deal in
conventional superhero books, works that are of interest to me tend to leap
to attention on the storefront. I am able to make discoveries more
easily.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3935"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_0852.png"
alt="IMG_0852" width="768" height="983" />

	<i>Sequential</i> skews towards British creators, but also carries
<i>Fantagraphics</i> just like <i>Comixology</i>. The difference is that the
rest of the goods in the shop are more like those on offer by<i>
Fantagraphics</i>: no capes and tights.

	Two works that I have discovered on <i>Sequential</i> recently are Rachel
Smith’s <i>House Party</i> and Ellen Lindner’s <i>Black Feather Falls. </i>It
turns out that I could have purchased Lindner’s books (1 and 2 are currently
available with 3 to come) on Comixology, but I may never have found them
there. When I was browsing on <i>Sequential</i>, up they popped, and I took a
chance. It’s useful that Sequential offers chestnut reviews from <i>Bleeding
Cool</i> and Paul Gravett to help prospective purchasers make their
decisions.

	Smith’s <i>House Party</i> is not available on Comixology, but it is the
kind of thing one might find in the “Submit” section of their store, along
with the works of Marc Ellerby and Adam Cadwell who coordinate the <i>Great
Beast</i> self-publishing imprint.  <i>Great Beast</i> is itself a fine
thing, offering titles not only from Smith, Ellerby, and Cadwell, but also
Dan Berry and Isabel Greenberg.

	<i>House Party</i> tells the story of a trio of young adults in their
twenties trying to reclaim their youth: a coming of age story of trying to
put the genie of adulthood and its attendant responsibilities back in the
bottle. The three share a flat, the venue of the party. Michelle, who starred
in college as a writer, feels stuck in an advertising agency job; Siobhan, an
artist, is working as a barista; and Neil, Michelle’s boyfriend who has
aspirations to stand-up comedy, works in a bar. So far, so Millennial. Like
most coming of age stories, <i>House Party</i> is as much about the
<i>zeitgeist</i> as the characters.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_0845.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3924"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_0845.png"
alt="IMG_0845" width="686" height="960" /></a>

	Of course, the attempt to return to the past merely serves to emphasize
the inescapability of the present. <i>House Party</i> kills nostalgia by
replaying a past event--the party of the title--that symbolizes youthfulness.
Rather than revitalizating the present, the party dissolves into tawdriness,
and results in the break-up of Michelle and Neil. This break-up is the
freeing moment, allowing the characters to move on. In fact, Michelle’s
discovery of a drunken Neil and Georgia, the lead singer from the Helveticas,
in bed, allows her to return to a repressed moment: Her friend Charlie says,
“He seemed really drunk...It probably didn’t mean anything...y’know?” And
Michelle recalls that Neil was drunk at a house party when he declared his
love for her. What “probably didn’t mean anything” was that initial
declaration.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_0847.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3926"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_0847.png"
alt="IMG_0847" width="668" height="593" /></a>

	The acceptance of this fact, allows Michelle to restart her creative
writing. And it allows Siobhan and even Neil to move forward. It turns out
that the illusory freedom of the past was in fact holding them back. This is
a familiar narrative arc and moral for a coming of age story, but Smith
handles it neatly.  The comic has some of the qualities of Bryan Lee
O’Malley’s <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> series: Georgia being the lead singer of the
Helveticas, for instance, signifies a similar gap between stardom, making it,
and not.

	Smith’s pleasurable drawing confirms a certain 21st Century British
cartooning aesthetic, and certainly a <i>Great Beast</i> one. Her work fits
right in with that of Marc Ellerby and Adam Cadwell. If you are a fan of
 <i>Chloe Noonan Monster Hunter</i> or John Allison’s excellent <i>Bad
Machinery</i>, Rachel Smith’s work will be up your alley.

	As a side note, Smith has a diary web-comic called <i><a
title="http://rachaelsonegoodthing.blogspot.ca/"
href="http://rachaelsonegoodthing.blogspot.ca/" target="_blank">One Good
Thing</a>,</i> which is distinguished by being a therapeutic exercise to help
Smith identify positive events in her life to counteract her depression. It
is worth following as an example of the possibilities of narrative drawing as
therapy. I’m a fan of the autobiographical comic movement in the UK,
seemingly universally inspired by James Kochalka’s <i>American Elf,</i> where
comics are an opportunity for self-discovery. As still another side note, the
last time I was drawn into an auto-bio web comic it was Kayla Hillier’s
<i>Galavant</i> that focused quite a bit on the creator’s relationship with
Adam Cadwell.  Smith’s webcomic also features her relationship with Cadwell.
It must be odd to be the love object in multiple auto-bio web comics, not to
mention being a cartoonist drawn into others' works.

	Ellen Lindner’s <i>Black Feather Falls</i> is a genre-comic and a period
comic: a 1920s murder mystery in which Tina Swift teams up with Miss McInteer
to form a crime solving duo. The story is based on the white feathers from
World War I that women would give to men to signify their cowardice at not
signing up for the front. In this case, obviously, the feather is black and
the murdered man is an apparently homeless person from a Scottish town so far
north it is more Scandinavian than anything else. The murder hinges on the
symbolic meaning of the black feather.

	As if to counteract this black/white dichotomy, Lindner splashes this
comic with bright colours. The murdered homeless man was wearing a brightly
coloured sweater that takes Swift and McInteer to the fictional Isle of
Gannet in the Shetland Islands, so far north that the residents speak a Norse
dialect. Normally, as regular readers know, I prefer black and white comics,
but Lindner's intentional thematic use of colour is clever and engaging.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_0850.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3929"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_0850.png"
alt="IMG_0850" width="699" height="451" /></a>

	With only two of the three issues out yet, it is impossible to comment on
The <i>Black Feather Falls</i> in its entirety (in fact, you can read the
whole story as a web comic <a href="http://activatecomix.com/158-1.comic"
target="_blank">here</a>), but the two I've read are fine work. The pairing
of TIna Swift, an American, style-conscious flapper, and Miss McInteer, a
straight-laced assistant works well. The comic is like a PBS mysteries
imported from Britain, injected with colour.  Like <i>House Party</i>, <i>The
Black Feather Falls</i> occupies rather than transforms a genre; but also
like Smith’s comic, Lindner’s makes you think about the meaning of the genre
in the present instance.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_0849.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3928"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_0849.png"
alt="IMG_0849" width="696" height="601" /></a>

	Reading these comics on <em>Sequential</em> was a pretty good experience.
My one gripe is that you have to choose a panel view or page view, which
means that, unlike in <em>Comixology</em>, you can’t view the whole page,
then read it panel by panel, then return to the whole page, which is my
preferred method of reading online comics. But the app is otherwise a smooth
running one that doesn't interfere with the reading process. At first, the
selection on <em>Sequential</em> was limited, but it is growing fast...not to
the point of being overwhelming, I hope.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm all for addressing
the margins, but are women really in or on the margins in comics? The answer
of course depends on how you want to frame the conversation. If we're talking
about the representation of women in comics featuring superheroes, what we
might still refer to as mainstream comics, there's a lot that one could point
to as troubling--and we've pointed to it a lot. A lot. To the point where
sometimes the feeling is we're pointing at it too much and thus devaluing the
pointing itself--I've even <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2011/07/19/32-boobs-and-babes-or-why-
comics-suck/">done it here</a>. It's the old if you say a word over and over
again it becomes meaningless gambit. To that end, I want to put it out there
that I dislike--as Marianne Moore did poetry--when comics critics have these
conversations. Certainly, women cannot claim to be the only marginalized and
misrepresented group in comics--how about racial minorities (or majorities)
for one--even in non-mainstream comics it's tough to find a racial
minority--even as a minor character. Suffice to say, I sometimes feel that
focusing on the marginalization of women in comics takes away from
discussions that present women in comics on their own terms. We're too busy
building them a room of their own when instead we might cast our gaze at the
room we already have and see how they intermingle, both positively and,
depending on how one wants to see it, negatively.

	First up, this conversation I'm starting here is a loaded one, I know
this. It's a loaded theme this round at Graphixia and I'm always wary of
addressing the supposedly marginal from a supposedly privileged position
because it's always dicey and fraught with the possibility of placation or
misinterpretation. Disclaimer outta the way, here's a few ways to think about
women in comics.

	If we take the representation of women out of the play--to some extent,
it's been done--women are very present in the emerging mainstream of what I
might term "thoughtful comics"--the ones that deal with a slice of life,
issues of trauma, sickness, personal identity and the like. The books that
have emerged from women in the recent history of novel-sized comics is
laudable. Few remember that <em>Dirty Plotte</em> by Julie Doucet was Drawn
and Quarterly's first book. Surely this speaks well of the position women
hold on the vanguard of "avant-garde" or "literary" comics. Indeed, comics
such as Marjane Satrapi's (who speaks like 40 languages) <em>Persepolis</em>
and Alison Bechdel's (a MacArthur "Genius" Award holder for 2014) <em>Fun
Home</em> represent foundational texts in the genre. Their influence and
shaping of narratives to follow is unmistakable and has come to dominate the
production of comics going forward. Issues of identity, isolation, and
trauma, to name but a few, which were nested in the "boy comics" of
generations past were re-addressed, replaced, and remade in a way that
expanded the possibilities of story-telling, but also influenced aesthetic
elements associated with comics.

	Satrapi's child-like scripture in <em>Persepolis</em> represented a shift
in avant-garde comics away from the sometimes hyper-realistic or arrogant
drawing of mainstream comics. More to the point, Satrapi's drawing reflected
a metonymical thoughtfulness about the interplay between character, story,
and art that heightened the interpretive cues in the comic. Julie Doucet's
title references and foregrounds the female genitalia while at the same time
the cover features her holding phallic references shooting smoke (or
something...). In short, there is no shyness here, no marginalized screaming
from a trapped corner. Instead, there is confidence and self-assuredness
nested within a confident--or messy--drawing style through which she
addresses a uniquely female perspective; it's not a reclamation of / for
woman, but a commentary without reservation or connection to previous
representations.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/doucet_02.jpg"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/doucet_02.jpg"
alt="doucet_02" width="475" height="700" class="aligncenter size-full
wp-image-3941" /></a>

	Alison Bechdel's <em>Fun Home</em>, while certainly about her own
identity, is also about the stuggles of her father's identifying as
masculine. That said, the book itself is about the struggles around secret
identities. The book is not about marginalized female identities, but about
hidden identities--another open nod to the "mainstream" genre that's not
explicit, but totally clear.

	The long and short of all this is to say that women in comics don't
really need any defence or attention from low-lifes like me. They've got all
that going on themselves. All my attention to them does is further
marginalize the important contributions women have made as practitioners.
Let's drop the bullshit: women have always figured prominently in the
development and deployment of what we might call "serious" comics and have
always, clearly, been reading the stuff boys always thought they weren't
interested in. It may well be that themes like this one--the ones that focus
on women in comics--are the problem.

	The final point I'll make is this one: can anyone imagine the state
comics as art today without the support of someone like Françoise Mouly? A
power player as art director for <em>The New Yorker</em>--putting a cartoon
on the cover since forever and bringing quality exposure to the likes of
Chris Ware and others--and as the energy behind the design principles that
sustained avant-garde comics in Raw. One might refigure the recent
"not-the-wife-of-Matt-Fraction" debacle in support of Kelly Sue DeConnick to
suggest that if anyone deserves a moniker like that it's Art Spiegleman who
should forever be known as "the husband of Françoise Mouly."

	So I call bullshit on the need to have a discussion that focuses on women
in comics. Women are comics right now. The aesthetic qualities they bring to
comics storytelling and style have reshaped both the serious comics of the
avant-garde and crept into the narratives and style of our most popular
mainstream books (recent standouts such as <em>Sex Criminals</em> and
<em>Hawkeye</em> reflect the introspective and identity-focused narratives
foregrounded by women--and both written by the husband of Kelly Sue
DeConnick, even). So I'm not going to give women a room of their own; they're
far too good to hive off in the corner and I want them in the room with
everyone else, where they belong, because they're awesome--unless of course
it's Lynda Barry.  ]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Following Dave’s
polemical opening to this series on women in comics is a tough gig, as I feel
whatever I write will now be judged in the context of his questioning of how
useful or valuable it is to have series on women in comics at all. But I
think it is valuable, and I have no doubt that this series will prove it,
though it’s late as I write this, so I’m going to be painting with broad
strokes here. Mostly, I agree with Dave that there is a danger here of
implying that women in comics need attention from male low-lives like us,
which of course, they don’t, nor do they need us to build them a room of
their own – I agree with Dave entirely that I want them in the same room as
everyone else. However, I think this series will reveal that women and comics
have a complex relationship, and that each post will reveal some of these
complexities and celebrate some of the women who have shaped comics into the
art form we know and love today, which is what I’d like to do.

	Like Dave, I wish to engage briefly with “thoughtful comics,” such as one
of my favourite graphic memoirs of late, <em>Tomboy </em>by <a
href="http://lizprincepower.com/">Liz Prince</a>. <em>Tomboy</em> is just one
example of why it’s worth writing about women in comics. Liz Prince is an
autobiographical cartoonist who has been a staple of Top Shelf’s excellent
lists since her first book, <em>Will You Still Love Me If I Wet The
Bed?</em>, came out in 2005. Her comics depict relationships, awkwardness,
loneliness and, in <em>Tomboy</em>, her history with her own gender identity
and physical appearance. <em>Tomboy </em>is a provocative, deep and engaging
memoir, just like those Dave pointed to as examples of why "women
<em>are</em> comics now," but is perhaps less possessed of the superficial
qualities which make the works of Alison Bechdel and Marjane Satrapi (for
example) attractive to the label of “literary comics.” Liz Prince’s visual
style is more straightforward and sketchy, in keeping with some of her Top
Shelf stablemates such as Jeffrey Brown, and removed from that of the
supposedly literary cartoonists whose books dominate discussions of
thoughtful comics, and often of women in comics too.

	[caption id="attachment_3946" align="aligncenter" width="531"]<a

Tomboy[/caption]

	It should be acknowledged that the majority of the “thoughtful comics”
Dave mentioned are memoirs, and that discussions surrounding women in comics,
aside from those of their portrayal in mainstream comics, thus tend towards
discussions of memoir and autobiographical comics. I’d like to see this
series discussing women in comics above and beyond this – women as creators
of fiction, women as characters in non-mainstream fictional comics (e.g. a
discussion of Enid and Rebecca as characters in <em>Ghost World</em>, which
is covered in-depth in the recent <em><a
href="http://danielclowesreader.tumblr.com/">Daniel Clowes Reader</a></em>),
how women as creators work and are received as part of writer-artist
collaborations versus sole creators, etc. That’s just my brief wishlist, and
of course I could be addressing that myself in this post, but I’d instead
like to take this opportunity to recall that although “women <em>are
</em>comics right now,” they weren’t always, and in there has been a tendency
in criticism and discussion of the form (and the genre of autobiography) to
canonize men at the expense of women.

	Robert Crumb (husband of Aline Kominsky), Chester Brown, Joe Matt, Harvey
Pekar, Jeffrey Brown, Ivan Brunetti, Justin Green – all of these cartoonists
are often given precedence as leaders of the autobiography genre, and they
have of course made a powerful and canonical contribution to alternative
comics, both with autobiographical and fictional cartooning. But there is a
danger, in allowing these men and their inward-looking,
masturbation-and-self-loathing-heavy memoirs to define the paradigm of
autobiographical comics (and thus, by extension, what we’re calling
“thoughtful comics” here), of underappreciating women’s narratives and
contributions, or of marginalizing their contributions by way of placing them
in their own category rather than allowing them into the room, as Dave warned
against. Personally, I got into alternative comics through the <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2013/12/03/144-jeffrey-browns-school-for
-whiny-children-or-why-whiny-comics-are-ok-sometimes/">famously whiny and
introspective Jeffrey Brown</a>, just as I engaged with prose books on an
adult level in my teens through authors of <a
href="http://bookriot.com/2012/12/11/penis-waving-literature-rock-out-with-
your-literary-cock-out/">penis-waving literature</a>, to use Brenna’s
excellent phrase. Having been a minor penis-waver myself and since having
widened my perceptions of autobiographical comics and of literature as a
whole and put the waving behind me, I feel the importance of acknowledging
and celebrating the contributions of women, and thus I have a personal
connection with the idea of a series on women in comics being a useful
exercise for Graphixia. If nothing else, it’s reminded me of my previous
tendency to make masturbatory male comics a paradigm and as such has reminded
me to make sure I never do so.

	To finish, I’d like to leave you with a comics character recently created
by cartoonist and TCJ Talkies podcast host <a
href="http://www.mikedawsoncomics.com/">Mike Dawson</a>: <a
href="http://www.mikedawsoncomics.com/post/98234826696/existential-angst-men-
vs-women-in-autobio-comics">Sad Man, or Sad-Boy</a>. Dawson’s creation,
existing only in his ephemeral one-shot Tumblr comics, writes a memoir
entitled <em>Sad Man Pulls at Himself </em>which is favourably reviewed.
Dawson is, to some extent, laughing at himself, an indication that male
autobiographical cartoonists are aware of the pitfalls of their penis-waving.
But his satire has teeth precisely because it is topical (despite referring
deliberately to 2007 as a significant year for male autobiographical comics),
and that, in my opinion, is proof (however small) of the necessity of a
series on women in comics, and of careful consideration of women in
autobiographical comics.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the main reasons
I enjoy contributing to Graphixia is that it’s a learning experience for me –
though I’m an adamant collector and reader of comics, I’ve mostly relegated
myself to the superhero genre or at least the major publishers in the
industry. So when we pick a monthly theme that I know less about than I
should, I like capitalizing on it to expand my horizons a bit. It’s not
something that I recognized as being a knowledge gap before, but women in
comics definitely fell into that category. While I could rattle off a few
names from the superhero genre (Gail Simone, the amazing Amanda Conner), I
knew that I was definitely lacking in something of substance for this month’s
post that we haven’t already covered at some point. That said, I used this as
an excuse to do some shopping at Vancouver’s (arguably best) comic store,
Golden Age Collectibles.

	As it turns out, women in comics is a subject knowledge gap for me for a
reason – women are vastly underrepresented in the field by an overwhelming
margin. This is a fact that I knew in an offhanded way, but I’d never really
understood the extent of it. Shopping through the store, I became stuck
looking for even any female <em>name</em> on the shelf, either author or
illustrator. Thinking that I was missing something, I turned to the owner of
the store, someone with comprehensive knowledge of comics both past and
present, asking for a few titles -or even anything - in an academic vein that
I could dive into and write about. I was met with a little confusion, some
discussion of the women in superhero comics I had already known about, and
that was it. Heading back to the shelves, however, I asked one of the store’s
female employees, Misty, the rather awkward question of where I could find
some women authors because of the post I was writing (and, as Dave hinted at,
there’s nothing that makes you feel like a bigger asshole than marginalizing
a group by labeling it – particularly if you’re part of a privileged group
that has played a part in the original subjugation). What she had to tell me
was very interesting, as it turns out that Misty was the perfect person to
speak with about this, being a member of the Valkyries – a collective of
women working in comics shops and in the industry – advocating for a bigger
voice in the market (they have a Facebook group if you’re interested, and the
beginnings of a great blog at <a
href="http://bewarethevalkyries.com/">bewarethevalkyries.com</a>). They're
doing some important work there, and it looks like they're having a lot of
fun besides. I couldn’t help but needle her with interview questions for a
good while.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bewarethevalkyries.
png" target="_blank" rel="http://bewarethevalkyries.com/"><img
class="aligncenter wp-image-3956 size-full"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bewarethevalkyries.
png" alt="bewarethevalkyries" width="1000" height="200" /></a>

	The store didn’t really carry much in the way of new graphic novels
created by women because, bluntly, there really aren’t that many being
published – in print anyways, as webcomics appear to be where women are able
to stake more of a claim as the medium evolves. Manga seems to have defied
the trend as well and has a comparatively large female authorship, but in all
the North American titles categorized by the more prolific known authors, the
selection was entirely male. This is difficult to explain, really, as comics
reading is far less one-sided in terms of sex as the media makes it out to
be, with female readership being over 46% (Schenker) – one would think that
the authorship would reflect this, at least in modern age publishing.

	There were a few graphic novels that she could name off that I’d already
known about (<em>Persepolis</em>, <em>Fun Home</em>), but for the most part
the topic sparked a conversation not just about how comics didn’t have
adequate female representation (again, at least in print), but that
representation of women had largely been co-opted by men. I thought of my
experience with seeing women in comics growing up outside of the superhero
genre – the biggest and most lauded was <em>Strangers in Paradise</em>,
written by Terry Moore. Then <em>Ghost World</em>, written by Dan Clowes.
Alison Bechdel may have changed things recently, but the past twenty years in
the industry (during which comics have arguably gotten self-consciously
smarter) have seen the vast majority of the portrayals of women that actually
reach the comic store’s shelves being crafted almost solely by male authors.

	During the impromptu interview, Misty mentioned a fact I hadn’t been
aware of: DC’s short lived attempt at capturing a wider female audience with
its “Minx” imprint back in 2007. This series of graphic novels was an attempt
to ride the wave of Persepolis, which had cracked the market of a teenaged
female readership, by producing similarly thoughtful pieces on coming of age,
with some of the superhero genre mixed in for good measure. However, despite
being headed up by a female editorial team, the Minx titles were written and
drawn almost exclusively by men, with only two titles boasting female
authors. Other series that I had collected from the era, like Gotham Girls,
were similarly written and drawn by men while openly attempting to welcome a
female audience into the fold. Being made aware of it, it’s difficult to find
this practice as anything other than insidious and, at its core, offensive.
The bigger problem is that it’s getting worse: with the recent New 52 launch
at DC Comics, the publisher went from 12% female creators to only 1%, with
the raw numbers being 157 male creators to 3 (Hanley). Finally becoming aware
of it, the numbers are a little staggering – the full breakdown can be seen
here: <a
href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/06/12/gendercrunching-the-dc-relaunch/
">http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/06/12/gendercrunching-the-dc-relaunch/</a>
. It’s even more problematic that the New 52 relaunch was immensely popular,
and the success would indicate that these strongly gender biased practices
are going to continue for at least the forseeable future – though it’s hard
to imagine them getting worse. This is definitely an issue, and one that does
need to be addressed.

	Though the conversation continued in this vein for some time, it’s not to
say that I came out of the store empty handed – I picked up a copy of the
superfluous, politically charged love story <em>Blue is the Warmest
Color</em> by Julie Maroh (which I hadn’t realized was a French language
graphic novel before it had been translated into the Palme d’Or winning film
at Cannes) and the wonderfully experimental, beautifully illustrated
examination of trauma <em>Letting it Go</em> written and illustrated by
holocaust survivor Miriam Katin. I was originally going to write my post on
one of these, but I think that doing so during this month’s topic would only
serve to highlight the problem even further – I asked Misty if the store had
thought of doing something similar, to have a section devoted to celebrating
female authors and illustrators, and she very rightly pointed out that to
create something like that would be insulting. So there seems to be a bit of
a Catch 22 in discussing women in comics, and perhaps this points to what
actually needs to happen: we <em>shouldn’t</em> discuss the topic, as doing
so has, inadvertently or otherwise, further marginalized it while at the same
time allowed the conversation to be hogged (and defined) by those same
paternalistic, sexist business models that have carried over from the Golden
Age of comics until today. So when I do eventually discuss the two excellent
graphic novels I’ve noted above and which Graphixia has in a roundabout way
led me to, it will rightly be solely under the heading of excellent comics’
art and storytelling. And in the meantime, I’ll probably be spending some
more time reading the posts on bewarethevalkyries.com.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[In a week when the UK’s
first Comics' Laureate has been announced, and is somewhat inevitably a white
man* and as 50% of the token woman quota on Graphixia (high five Brenna!). I
could have weighed in with my thoughts on being a woman who reads and writes
about comics, but instead I would like to talk about how I have been lured
back into buying monthly comics by some awesome female characters.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	The first of these is Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie’s <em>The Wicked
and the Divine</em> (TWTD). During the summer, during a spate of
procrastinatory reading a sale on Comixology saw me purchase their entire run
on <em>Young Avengers</em> and devour it in approximately 2 minutes flat.
Hooked, I decided to pick up TWTD and I immediately fell in love with its
intriguing storyline, beautiful artwork and most of all its smart, fierce,
multi-dimensional women.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Kieron Gillen writes characters that I wish were my friends and as I
cannot possible bear to wait for the Trade Editions to come out I am now
stuck (this seem too begrudging a word for a joyful experience) buying and
devouring the comics monthly and then forcing my friends to read them quickly
so we can dissect them together. But for this round’s theme it seems even
more appropriate to talk about some kick-ass girls written and drawn by women
themselves. And so on to <em>Lumberjanes</em>…

height="340" />

	&nbsp;

	Written by Grace Ellis and Noelle Stevenson and with art by Brooke Allen
<em>Lumberjanes</em> is the story of five friends attending summer camp at
Miss Quinzilla Thiskwin Penniguigul Thistle Crumpet’s Camp for Hardcore Lady
Types. Having worked in residential Summer Schools for over ten years and
being a big fan of kick-ass groups of female friends I suspected that I was
going to enjoy this comic, but I didn’t realize quite how cool these
particular Hardcore Lady Types were going to be.

	&nbsp;

-19.55.23-300x178.png" alt="#183 - Hattie 3" width="300" height="178" /></a>

	I’ve now demolished the entire series so far and I am itching to get my
dirty paws on the next issue. These girls are funny, resourceful, brave,
sassy and loyal and their irrepressible sense of adventure is utterly
charming. As they trick Yetis, explore underground caverns, and face the
campers from Mr Theodore Tarquin Reginald Lancelot Herman Crump’s Camp for
Boys the five friends stick together, trust one another and have a great line
in top notch putdowns for their adversaries.

	&nbsp;

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screenshot-2014-10-
21-19.20.01.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-3966 size-medium"

	Jo, April, Mal, Molly and Ripley aren’t stupidly glamorous or impossibly
funny or unbelievable quirky, they’re a motley crew of friends that are tall,
short, skinny, less skinny some have good hair, some bad hair and others have
messy hair and they go on adventures together. Which pretty much describes me
and my friends! I like reading comics about people who look like my friends,
talk like us (sort of) and don’t wear lycra to their nocturnal voluntary
excursions. I encounter very few yetis in my daily wanderings round Glasgow
and even fewer when working in Summer Schools, but I like to think that if I
did need to deal with a Yeti situation I too would bribe them with some of my
cookies.

	&nbsp;

	I’m also really enjoying reading comics that aren’t afraid to be silly.
This summer I cried my way through Matilda Tristram’s <a
href="http://www.mmaattiillddaa.com/probably-nothing/intro/"><em>Probably
Nothing</em></a> and have since thrust my copy at everyone I know, because I
loved it (she, incidentally is another awesome Woman in Comics and I will
write about <em>Probably Nothing</em> here very soon). However I tend to
choose quite sad or 'heavy' books to read. Discovering <em>Lumberjanes</em>
has given me a comic to read that makes me laugh and whilst I might be a
little older than the intended audience the jokes, references and wit of the
humour is more than enough to keep me hooked.

	Whilst I know all of you know that girls can be funny, resourceful,
fierce, witty and strong, its really nice to see that conviction reflected in
a fictional comic in a non sanctimonious fashion. I was a big fan of Marvel’s
<em>Runaways</em> and <em>Lumberjanes</em> seems like a natural step on from
that but without being part of a world that already has such distinct and
problematic dynamics as regards the possible roles and looks occupied by
women.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	<span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Cliff’s Notes Version of Hattie’s
Post: READ <em>LUMBERJANES</em> NOW! They’re sassy and cool and I wish I was
their friend.</strong></span>

	<span style="color: #0000ff;">P.S Read Matilda Tristram's book
too!</span>

	<span style="color: #339966;">P.P.S Then go and buy The Wicked and The
Divine and come and talk to me about it (and all these other books) on
twitter (@HattieK)</span>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[A few weeks ago Dave
railed against the idea of posts about women in comics, “<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/09/30/181-lets-stop-focusing-on-
women-in-comics/" target="_blank">Let’s stop focussing on women in
comics</a>” he said, “Women are comics right now”. That’s as may be but how
come only 10% of Graphixia posts are about women creators? If there are as
many great comics being produced by women as men, why is Graphixia not
covering them? For me the problem isn’t that we are focussing on women in
comics but the fact that the default is focussing on men in comics. How about
we stop focussing on men in comics? How about we stop focussing on white men
in comics? How about we stop focussing on straight white men in comics? How
about we stop focussing on cisgender straight white men in comics? And so on.
This series of posts may go some way to redressing this imbalance but we have
to keep it up, and not fall back on the <a

-default-man" target="_blank"><i>default</i></a>.

	<a href="http://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/swain.htm"
target="_blank">Carol Swain</a>’s <a
href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/gast-pre-order--3.html?vmcchk=
1" target="_blank"><i>GAST</i></a> starts with the swallows. One panel across
the top tier of a page, two swallows on a telephone line and a open sky of
sparse clouds. The next two tiers are three panels each, closing in on the
swallows as they build their nest on a barn. The second page is a 9-panel
grid in which we see a child with binoculars watching the swallows and noting
their activities. This is Helen and we will follow her (and the 9-panel grid)
for the rest of the book as she investigates her new surroundings, having
recently moved from London to Llanparc, a village in North Wales. Llanparc is
the fictional setting of many of Swain’s stories and lies not far from the
border with England, a bus trip away from Oswestry, the (very real) market
town in Shropshire that draws some of her characters away from Llanparc.

Swallows in <em>GAST</em> by Carol Swain.[/caption]

	Swain’s swallows are completely believable as swallows (or gwennol in
Welsh), and her pencil lines and shading allow us to be drawn into the story,
unlike the inky crow in Jeff Lemire’s <i>Essex County </i>that I mentioned in
<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/09/04/179-underwhelmed-by-ink-in-
essex-county/" target="_blank">my last post</a>. Lemire’s bird only served to
distance me from the story. Like Lemire, Swain has been described as ‘The
Raymond Carver of (British) comics.’ As Paddy noted recently in reference to
Carver “<a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/08/12/177-what-is-not-drawn/"
target="_blank">looking at and understanding <i>Essex County</i> is as much
about what is not said and what is not told, as what is</a>” and this could
also be said to apply to Swain’s work. Helen’s investigations lead her to the
neighbouring farm to try to find out what happened to the ‘rare bird’
mentioned by Bill the eggman. An occurrence that has caused his hens to stop
laying. Swain slowly reveals details but never the whole picture and we have
to read between the panels as much as Helen reads between the lines of what
is said.

alt="Silence in GAST by Carol Swain." width="600" height="537" /></a> Silence
and Helen in <em>GAST</em> by Carol Swain.[/caption]

	There is also the silence, the first chapter as Helen follows the
swallows has no speech balloons, just an inference of meaning from Swain’s
atmospheric pencil drawings and the occasional sentence in Helen’s notebook.
With the silence there is also space. Swain evokes the wide open spaces of
the North Wales border country even when the strict grid structure of the
comic closes in on Helen as she walks around exploring. The silence is broken
when Helen hears shouts of “Hey! Hey!” coming from a farm outbuilding, inside
she is confronted by two sad-faced dogs. She stares at them for a few panels,
having not quite expected what she sees. Eventually the dogs speak “Well? Got
any food for us?” Helen is unperturbed by this turn of events which may
initially seem odd to the reader, but like a frog being slowly boiled we
accept the touches of magical realism and continue with the story.

	Helen is a fairly androgynous child, as many 11 year olds are, and the
dogs are curious about about whether she is a ci or a gast - the Welsh terms
for dog and bitch. They want to know whether Helen is male or female, and the
book explores themes of gender, identity and growing up as Helen investigates
the fate of the ‘rare bird’. She finds a make-up bag in a skip on the farm
and is fascinated by the contents, which she logs meticulously in her
notebook along with other items of her investigation and her growing Welsh
vocabulary.

<em>GAST</em> by Carol Swain.[/caption]

	Helen’s inquiries takes her to the local cemetery and on a bus trip to
Oswestry, journeys she undertakes on her own. There is an amount of tension
in these journeys, Swain donates many panels and several pages to each,
showing the time they take up in Helen’s world. This conjures up my own
memories of childhood summers when days seemed much longer, a sense of
endless time lost in the adult world. The tension comes from Helen’s own
timetable, she needs to attend a funeral and catch a bus, and as an adult
reader I worry that she will arrive in time. Time in Helen’s world is slower
than time in mine.

	While writing about the book I don’t want to say too much about the
story, I want to allow the reader the same experience that I had when reading
for the first time with very little idea of what was happening. To allow the
quiet power of Swain’s writing and drawing to pull the reader in. Swain has
been producing comics for around 25 years. She trained as a painter and
apparently turned up one day at a workshop run by Paul Gravett and just <a
href="http://www.paulgravett.com/index.php/profiles/creator/carol_swain"
target="_blank">started making comics</a>. Then she kept going, first
self-publishing her own book <i>Way Out Strips</i> before Fantagraphics
picked it up, and then producing several works such as <a
href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/foodboy-3.html"
target="_blank"><i>Foodboy</i></a><i>, </i>which explore the worlds of people
on the fringes of society, punks, skinheads, hippies, and others who don’t
fit in.

	Swain’s artwork is mainly black and white and made with soft pencils so
that we see the texture and grain of the art on the reproduced page. She has
occasionally produced strips in colour, again in pencil, but she mainly saves
colour for book covers. The beautiful cover to <i>GAST</i> has an almost
Impressionist look as it evokes autumnal colours and an overcast sky, themes
of change again, in season and weather. It also brings to mind the work of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Briggs" target="_blank">Raymond
Briggs</a>, another British comics artist who comes from the art school and
illustration world and makes comics without being imbued in the world of
superheroes or the <em>Beano</em> and <em>Dandy</em>. Briggs' characters such
as Ug, Jim and Fungus are not very far removed from Swain's such as Gar in
<em>Foodboy</em>. Many comics artists make work that is so invested in
previous generations of comic making and it is refreshing to see artists
create work from the fringes, or even outside, of that sphere of influence.

	A work often left out of Swain’s bibliography is the once banned <a
href="http://www.punknews.org/review/7691/peter-milligan-brendan-mccarthy-
carol-swain-skin-graphic-novel" target="_blank"><i>SKIN</i></a> by Peter
Milligan and Brendan McCarthy. <i>SKIN</i> is the story of young skinhead boy
in the 1970s whose mother was given Thalidomide during pregnancy. He grows up
with shortened arms “seal boy Martin ‘Atchet”. The art is by McCarthy, and
Swain is credited as colourist but with the bright, swirling, pages produced
in paint, pastel, crayon and pencil it is difficult to see where the line is
drawn between the two occupations. One can certainly detect Swain’s hand in
the textures of the pages and it would be interesting to hear how much of it
is her work. She is appearing at the <a
href="http://www.comicafestival.com/index.php/festival/festival_detail/
what_makes_a_cult_comic_with_rob_davis_ilya_paul_rainey_carol_swain"
target="_blank">Cult Comics</a> event next week as part of the <a
href="http://www.comicafestival.com/" target="_blank">Comica Festival</a>,
perhaps we will find out there.

	Swain’s appearance at that event is slightly odd given that her work
didn’t make it into the recently published <a
href="http://www.constablerobinson.com/?section=books&amp;book=
the_mammoth_book_of_cult_comics_9781472111494_trade_paperback"
target="_blank"><i>Mammoth Book of Cult Comics</i></a> which it is promoting.
Not many women did (less than 10%), and in his review <a
href="http://www.paulgravett.com/index.php/articles/article/pg_tips_no.39"
target="_blank">Paul Gravett</a> looks forward to the potential second volume
“in which [editor] Ilya plans to feature more than just two women
participants”. In his introduction Ilya defensively puts this down to there
not being enough good work available, but maybe he wasn’t looking hard
enough. He gives “honourable mentions” to a few including <a
href="http://britishcomics.wikia.com/wiki/Myra_Hancock" target="_blank">Myra
Hancock</a>, <a href="http://www.katecharlesworth.com/" target="_blank">Kate
Charlesworth</a>, and <a
href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/megan-kelso.html?vmcchk=1"
target="_blank">Megan Kelso</a>, but claims to have omitted Carol Swain (who
he does deem of sufficient quality) due to the inconvenient size of her
comics pages! If we don’t want to focus specifically on women creators, as
Dave suggests, but include them as default then we need to change the
default. I’ll start (and it is only a start) by suggesting cartoonists such
as <a href="http://britishcomics.wikia.com/wiki/Beryl_the_Bitch"

<title>#186 Women in Comics Scholarship: The Issue of Tokenism</title>
<link>http://www.graphixia.ca/2014/11/186-women-in-comics-scholarship-the-
issue-of-tokenism/</link> <pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2014 18:32:22 +0000</pubDate>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[In recent years, the
issue of the place for women in comics scholarship has gained attention and
momentum. It's very common, now, to see tweets from comics conferences
weighing gender representation and celebrating the participation of women in
what has traditionally been a boys-only club. (Sometimes this conversation
lacks an awareness of intersectionality -- that comics scholarship has
traditionally not only been a boys club, but a white anglophone boys club,
but some progress in this area has been evident in recent years, too.)

	Before Hattie joined us, I jokingly referred to myself as the Token
Uterus at the Graphixia table (now Hattie and I are Token Ovaries,
collectively), and while the phrase was tongue-in-cheek and essentialist, the
feeling of tokenism is something I experience in almost every interaction I
have around comics scholarship. This is not true in my life as a Canadian
Literature specialist, where a good share of the major thinkers are women, or
in my life as a college teacher, where pedagogy is often dominated by women.
But in comics, I feel it all the time. And some of the time, bro-scholars,
the problem is you guys. Here are two problems I encounter with alarming
frequency:

	<strong>1. Stop telling me I'm the token woman on a project.</strong>

	You know what sucks? Reading back through the email chain of a project
I've just been looped in on and seeing, "Ok, looks good but we're going to
need a woman on this. Anyone know one?" Yay, I'm the one woman you know who
works in this area. You didn't loop me into the project because of my
insights or my writing skill, you looped me in because you realized at the
last minute that you'd crafted yet another sausage fest. Don't do this. And
if you do this, for the love of god, edit the email chain.

	I'm glad my name comes up first when you need to think of a woman. I'd
rather my name comes up first when you need to think of a scholar.

	<strong>2. It's not my job to find other women to write on comics for
your project.</strong>

	If I say no to your project for whatever reason, the appropriate response
is not to ask me, "Sorry to hear that. Can you suggest another woman to take
your place?" If you care about women in comics scholarship beyond not wanting
people to yell at you for having no women on your project, shouldn't you be
reading scholarship by women? Shouldn't you have a body of academics to call
on to help you decide on the best fit? Shouldn't you want more that just the
first woman who popped into the head of the first women who popped into
yours?

	I want you to care about this for real and engage and encourage a
community of practice for all comers. I don't want you to only care about
women in comics scholarship when you think someone is counting.

	Listen: I'm a publication-hungry junior scholar. I want to work with you.
I want to join your project. I want to write for you. But I also think that
my body of work entitles me to the respect of my colleagues beyond my ability
to make up the numbers on a project. My Token Uterus is attached to a brain;
it would like some of your attention, too.

	I'm glad you're paying attention to the issue of gender in comics
scholarship. Now stop being insulting about it.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Judith Vanistendael is
arguably the most famous graphic novelist from Flanders, perhaps sharing the
niche with Brecht Evens and Olivier Schrauwen. Her prominent position on the
international scene as a widely translated author, nominated several times at
Angoulême and this year for the Eisner Awards, is closely related to changes
in the Flemish community in Belgium. In the last decades, Flemish comics have
joined the 'graphic novel phenomenon' under the impulse of new alternative
publishers as Bries and Oogachtend, high-quality comics-focused formations at
art schools such as Sint-Lukas, and the financial support of the Flemish
Literature Fund through grants and subsidies for translation. Vanistendael's
career is not only a neat example of these aspects; her debut work also
displays the somewhat stereotypical traits expected from graphic novels:
translated into English as <em>Dance by the Light of the Moon</em>, her
two-volume <em>De maagd en de neger </em>(2007-2009) is a
semi-autobiographical narrative about the love relationship between the young
Sofie and Abou, a Togolese political refugee in Brussels. A fluid
black-and-white drawing style, an autobiographical narrative where political
and personal matters are narrowly intertwined, and the 'token woman' (cf. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/11/11/186-women-in-comics-
scholarship-the-issue-of-tokenism/">Brenna's post</a>): Vanistendael had
everything to become the Flemish Marjane Satrapi. However, a close look
directly reveals that, beyond their affinities in terms of themes, their
approach to visual storytelling is radically different. The framing of
Vanistendael as the “Flemish Satrapi” implies a problematic gendered
categorization that plays up the autobiographical, thematic and real-life
contents, simplifying what makes her work truly interesting.

	&nbsp;

	As <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/09/30/181-lets-stop-focusing-on-
women-in-comics/">Dave</a> recalls, women have played a pivotal role in
redefining comics in both stylistic and thematic terms, producing compelling
slice-of-life narratives dealing with issues of trauma and identity. Indeed,
Satrapi's <em>Persepolis</em> and Bechdel's <em>Fun Home </em>are canonized
memoirs that have clearly set the tone for the graphic novel as a
loosely-defined genre. Both in Europe and North-America, autobiography
quickly became a dominant trend as it posited comics not only as objects made
by <em>auteurs </em>but also promised an apt confrontation with the real
contrasting with the supposedly escapist adventures of mainstream comic books
(cf. Beaty's “Autobiography as Authenticity”). Although I would agree with <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/10/07/necessary-memoirs-
autobiography-and-women-in-comics/">Paddy</a> that women autobiographical
narratives provide a welcome and necessary counterpoint to the masturbatory
and self-loathing tendency illustrated by Robert Crumb, Joe Matt, and the
like, I do not really recognize the power struggle he sketches between these
two trends. In fact,  Bechdel and Satrapi have had such a resounding success
and pivotal role in establishing graphic novels in a broad cultural sphere
that I would rather go with Dave in saying that “women <em>are</em> comics
right now.” But, given this crucial role, there is rather a danger for too
strong an association between women comics artists and autobiographical
narrative, as if women came into comics only through the recent development
of this genre. In fact, the research of Trina Robbins – culminating in her
recent <em>Pretty in Ink </em>(2013) – is invaluable for considerably
expanding the historical relationships between women and comics. If women
loom large over the graphic novel scene, this does not mean in any way that
they have been systematically kept at bay until the 1990s. However, given the
prominent position of women cartoonists as Bechdel and Satrapi, and the
critical attention paid to them (cf. Chute's <em>Graphic Women</em>), women's
comics tend to be more quickly framed in terms of autobiography – a genre
that is now increasingly perceived as stereotypical for the graphic novel.

	&nbsp;

	This is clearly expressed in the foreword to first volume of
Vanistendael's <em>De maagd en de neger</em>, a comics page by Vanistendael's
teachers at Sint-Lukas, Johan de Moor and Nix, who recall their first
encounter with her work. Their first reaction sounds “alweer van dat
vrouwelijk autobiographic geneuzel” (something like 'yet another piece of
women's autobiographical rubbish'), but they quickly see more to it than the
usual shtick. Although their comment is ironical, it highlights the somewhat
overbearing emphasis on autobiography in comics today, but dangerously tends
to relegate that genre to clichéd stories by women.   What their foreword
more insightfully reveals, is that Vanistendael's work cannot be limited to a
narrow (and sexist) stereotype of women autobio, while recognizing that she
undoubtedly works in the context of autofiction. The reception of her work
has quickly adopted the autobiographical dimension of her work in order to
emphasize real-life concerns, shifting the attention away from the formal
complexity of the work and towards its author.

	&nbsp;

	This attention is at least partly due to the fact that Judith's father,
Geert van Istendael, is himself a renowned Belgian journalist and writer,
famous for an essay on the country's labyrinthine structure. The story, which
focuses on the father's mixed feeling about his daughter's relationship with
a political refugee, had of course the potential to draw media-attention to
polemical issues. But this father-daughter relationship is interesting in
more than one aspect. The first volume of <em>De maagd en de neger</em>
actually is an adaptation of “Berich uit de Burcht” a short story written by
Geert van Istendael about precisely the same subject, but the
autobiographical dimension of which remained unknown to the public. Judith
Vanistendael's comic is, so to speak, her answer to her father's story in two
volumes: the first one adapts the short story, told from the father's
perspective, while the second adopts Sofie's own viewpoint. Narratologically
speaking, the work takes avail of the split narrative channels to introduce a
polyphony resisting Lejeune's author-character-narrator unity, in a manner
that recalls <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/02/11/154-collaborative-
autobiography-lenfance-dalan/">Guibert's comics</a>. The first volume is not
'merely' an adaptation: the text is entirely borrowed from the short story,
but the drawings also participate in the storytelling, and the style is
uniform across both books. The 'mute' sequence of the park-bench exemplify
this contribution, demonstrating how drawing style and page-layout make it
something radically different, and through which another voice transpires. In
the second volume, after a reception that directly confronted her with her
own life-experience, she went to emphasize fictional framing device by
depicting Sofie as a storytelling character. The book opens up on a bed-time
“Once Upon a Time” tale, where textual and visual tracks tell the same story,
but with different shades and tones: a telling example is the way the sex
scene is summarized into a kiss.

	&nbsp;

alt="vanistendael" width="450" height="645" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	Vanistendael's comics is thus a co-mixture (as Spiegelman would say) of
her father's and her own artistic production, resulting in a fascinating and
intricate but fluid narration, and one that differs from usual autobio
comics.  As such, it also anticipates her praised graphic novel <em>When
David Lost his Voice </em>(2013), in which the narrative is resolutely
dialogic and polyphonous. This technique, of course, is not only a formalist
artifice, but an attempt at depicting the psychological and political
complexities of love and immigration. Framing her work as a narrowly defined
autobiographical narrative does no right to the talent of the author as an
artist, and participates in a gendered logic that ultimately reduces the
scopes of women's contribution to the comics form.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[To kick off the next
Graphixia sequence in which we pair up to discuss the work of interesting
teams, Damon and I have chosen Bruce Paley’s memoir <a
href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/giraffes-in-my-hair-a-rock-n-
roll-life.html?vmcchk=1" target="_blank"><i>Giraffes in My Hair: A Rock ‘n’
Roll Life</i></a>, drawn by <a
href="http://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/swain.htm" target="_blank">Carol
Swain</a>, as our text. We found the book interesting because the title
promises a kind of rock star grandeur, when in fact the book presents him as
a fairly ordinary person with some interesting, period-related stories to
tell in which he often appears on the margins rather than central to the
action. This is not to say the book is a failure; rather Paley seems to play
up his marginal status that Swain illustrates in symbolic ways. Our strategy
was to pick particular pages and discuss them, with each of us writing about
the page we selected and perhaps adding commentary to what the other wrote.
Generally, our themes are Paley’s missing the main event of any given
story--not making The Who concert in time, not going to Vietnam, not
resolving the conflict with his father--and Swain’s depiction of it and
comics intertextuality. Art by Carol Swain unless noted. <h2><strong>Page 13
(Peter)</strong></h2> This page sums up the book for me in terms of the way
it represents Paley’s inability to participate in the big event. He has been
hitchhiking from Fort Wayne, Indiana to Springfield Illinois 250 miles away
to hear The Who play live. The old man with whom he hitches a ride has a
breakdown and by the time he gets another ride, he is too late to hear
anything but the strains of “You Are Forgiven” as he climbs the fence. Once
he’s over, he hears “Good Night” and that’s it; his mission to hear his
favourite band comes a cropper. <a

three panels of page 13 that show him getting closer and closer to the
fairground fence. The lyrics and musical notes rise up like smoke from the
distance. The final panel shows him hanging from the fence. It’s a great
panel to end the page on because I can imagine Paley being stuck there,
excluded from the scene.  When we turn the page to see that he has been
successful climbing the fence, Paley’s triumph is short-lived: The next panel
we see “Thank You Illinois!” and the concert is over. We don’t get to see The
Who either. Paley’s “Rock ‘n’ Roll” life is just this sort of caper. The
actual Rock ‘n’ Roll is always on the horizon, never actually in the present
moment so that Paley can experience it. I prefer to read the book’s words and
art as knowing that Paley is always just missing out. It’s not a failure of
the book in any way, but its point. <h2><strong>Pages 25-26

renditions of the Silver Surfer and Galactus.[/caption]

	The point of this segment is to illustrate both Paley’s enthusiasm for
comics and his alienation from the world around him. As we can see, Swain is
quite faithful in her redrawing of Kirby’s original panel. There are a couple
of things to point out here. First, this is a version of comics
intertextuality in the book that matches the literary intertextuality
elsewhere: Kerouac, for instance. It gives us a contrast between the type of
comic this book is and the typical super hero comic. The Silver Surfer’s
dilemma is a kind of cosmic existentialist crisis, while Paley’s is more
mundane: spurned by his father rather than Galactus, Paley imagines blasting
the neighborhood with his super powers. But the second and most interesting
aspect of this segment occurs when Paley talks about waiting for for the next
issue of Silver Surfer to come out, but it never does. Above a panel that
shows Paley looking at a car that seems to be driven by his father who has
kicked him out of the house, we see the following in a text box: “I guess
some things are never resolved.” <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/giraffe26.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4025"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/giraffe26.jpg"
alt="giraffe26" width="1337" height="1775" /></a> This lack of resolution
covers the whole book, not just the missing Silver Surfer issue or the
relationship between Paley and his father. The overarching feeling of reading
<i>Giraffes in My Hair</i> is that of waiting for a climactic moment that
will resolve Paley’s life. But that never happens. And I think that is what
Paley is using the autobiographical form to express: a set of incidents that
are loosely related but that don’t necessarily cohere into a plot the way
that we expect from a piece of fiction.

	Damon: The influence of the Beats and superhero comics also brings to
mind another comic that channels these inspirations, but in a very different
way. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four:_Unstable_Molecules"
target="_blank"><i>Unstable Molecules: The True Story of Comics’ Greatest
Foursome</i></a>, written by James Sturm and with art by Guy Davis and Robert
Sikoryak, purports to be a biography of the real-life people that were the
basis for The Fantastic Four. The characters squabble, much as they do in
Kirby and Lee’s original, and Johnny Sturm/Storm leaves the group in anger,
this time under the spell of a beat poet Joey King (allusions to Jack Kerouac
and Jack Kirby but also, I like to think, King’s name gives us a clue that
Sturm’s biography is fiction, Jo-King, geddit?). As Johnny joins the beatniks
in midnight beach party revels, his left-behind friend, nerdy comic book fan
Richard Mannelman, imagines himself killing the beatniks in the style of a
1950s comics. A Nick Fury-esque figure gunning down ‘every last stinking
beatnik’ much like Paley destroys his neighbourhood.

src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/giraffe34-s.jpg"
alt="giraffe34 s" width="600" height="823" /></a> On the first page of the
strip The Draft we see further intertextual engagement in Paley’s story, and
one of the few places where Paley interacts positively with his father; Paley
senior ‘wisely’ tells his son not to get drafted and sent to Vietnam. This
panel is placed between two panels showing Swain’s recreation of two of the
most famous images from the Vietnam War, Eddie Adams’ photograph of Nguyễn
Văn Lém being shot in the head, and ‘The Terror of War’ by Nick Ut, showing
children running from a napalm attack. Swain’s soft pencil marks recreating
the clouds from the bombing. In the next panel Nixon is shown having an idea
to restructure the draft system with the classic trope of a light bulb
appearing above his head. This, and other emanata later in the story sit
oddly within Swain’s art, which always seems more rooted in reality, but they
provide narrative shortcuts where the art is more illustrative of the
narration boxes rather than telling it’s own story. Swain’s art also compares
Nixon’s new draft lottery to a game of Monopoly where some pass directly to
Vietnam (without collecting $200) and others receive a ‘Get out of jail free’
card.

	Peter: We are finding that this “slice of life” realist comic is in fact
highly symbolic and metaphorical, particularly when Swain is drawing moments
of Paley’s life that have a more general meaning. These are times when
specific experience turns into general significance. <h2><strong>Page 101
(Peter)</strong></h2> <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/giraffe101.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4028"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/giraffe101.jpg"
alt="giraffe101" width="1353" height="1818" /></a> I was interested in this
page because a) it is another example of comics intertextuality, echoing the
Silver Surfer panels and b) that intertextuality uses the genre of the horror
comic to represent Paley’s heroin addiction. The only colour page in the
book, it parodies the EC comics covers. True life horror is converted into
the register of fictional horror, which is usually outlandish and
implausible. HP Lovecraft and Edgar Allen Poe. On this cover, Bruce is bald
on top, suggesting a much older Bruce than we have seen up to now. He looks
gaunt and ill. The full moon is out, a couple of junkies lurch and sway in
the background in front of a boarded up tenement. Three circular panels on
the left of the page list the characters. “The Hand” in the first panel is
the horror element, something like the creature under the sidewalk or the
beating heart under the floorboards. The hand is the disembodied body part of
the dealer who receives the cash and dispenses the heroin. While Bruce’s
addiction is generally not portrayed as a horror story at all--Bruce claims
to kick heroin fairly straightforwardly--it is framed by elements from the
horror comic:  in the last couple of panels a figure of death is shown
accepting money for drugs and grabbing the wrist of its victim. This kind of
framing is something new in the book, which up to now has been in the mode of
autobiographical realism--even the Silver Surfer panels can be explained away
as Bruce simply explaining his love of the comic.  It is perhaps a suggestion
of what kind of story this book could have been if Bruce had not kicked
heroin. <h2><strong>Page 123 (Damon)</strong></h2> <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/giraffe125.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4029"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/giraffe125.jpg"
alt="giraffe125" width="1336" height="1776" /></a> In our discussion of many
of the pages in this book we have highlighted what I see as a tension between
the authors, and their taste in comics. As you might expect of an American
who went on to run a comic shop in London, Paley’s taste seems to run to the
mainstream superhero and horror comics that he grew up with, whereas Swain,
who is a generation younger and grew up in Wales, comes from the indie and
art comic scene. In his history of Escape magazine Paul Gravett talked of ‘<a
href="http://www.paulgravett.com/articles/article/escape_magazine"
target="_blank">the thrill ‘discovering’ Carol Swain drawing her first ever
magical comic at an Escape workshop</a>’. This juxtaposition of the authors’
interests in comics plays out on the pages with Swain tackling some Kirby
artwork and channeling EC comics for a chapter title page.

	However, there are many moments where Swain seems free of this tension,
and it allows her storytelling skills to come to the fore unencumbered by
emanata or superhero references. Many of the dialogue scenes, and quiet
moments of travel seem to be ‘pure’ Swain. One such scene is the last page in
Needs Must When the Devil Drives where Paley and his friends Andy and Eva are
wandering around New York in the worst blizzard for 20 years trying to score
some heroin. Most of the usual dope places are closed but they eventually
find some enterprising dealers who are lowering a bucket to the streets with
the drugs to avoid going out into the snow. The three friends stand around
discussing what to order as the snow falls around them in large fluffy
flakes. The flakes appear like moth eaten holes in Swain’s drawings. The
panels are mostly devoid of backgrounds emphasising just how white and bereft
of life the world around them has become. In the second last panel the reader
looks down on the white square with Paley and co staring up as they watch the
bucket float up to the dealers. They are struggling to comprehend Andy’s
decision not to buy drugs after their long quest in the snow. In the last
panel Swain beautifully sketches in some buildings in soft pencil behind the
snowflakes, Andy is walking away as Paley concludes ‘Junkie logic - go
figure’.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[This post features an
Easter Egg--a hidden clue to its complete reading. We're riding the edge of
the wave here, but trying to think about the hidden aspects of collaboration;
the visual verses the unseen. So, half of this post is hidden from
<strong>view</strong> unless you search for it. It's not hard to find; one
hint: you need to <strong>view</strong> what's hidden in the page--not simply
what's visible--the "<strong>source</strong>."

	Collaboration, in comics as elsewhere, helps us to reframe our static
perspectives <!-- One such "static perspective" is only looking at surfaces
and not being aware of the underlying secrets the platform might reveal -->–
Graphixia has helped me do this a lot by getting me to approach comics in a
more academic way through the suggestions offered by my peers, putting more
esoteric fare in my hands than I’m normally gravitated towards. Rarely though
do I need someone to tempt me to read a superhero book, as I read practically
everything I can get my hands on (I’ve written about my disturbingly large
collection here before). But then Dave started writing about Hawkeye and
suggesting it to others.

	<!-- The irony of this statement is that in the beginning, at least as
far as I was concerned, Scott was the most academic among us. His
contributions to Graphixia certainly reflect more attention to the
historiography and facts of comics than any one of us. Like in his daily
life, Scott is the head librarian at Graphixia, someone who takes a lot of
time and care to get the facts correct. I'm flattered that he even thought to
listen to anything I had to say.-->

	Personally, I’ve never been a fan of the character. Hawkeye has existed
in many iterations since his first appearance in Tales of Suspense in the
60’s. Mostly, he was the Iron Man nobody wanted, out of place on a team of
heroes imbued with fantastic powers and with writers unsure of what to do
with him. What good is an archer against hordes of aliens, against villains
with mystical powers – against, very often, gods? There was perhaps a certain
everyman potential about him, but even this was masked early on by writers
stamping his carnival-esque character as a womanizing alcoholic, likely
because if they couldn’t emphasize his powers to make him interesting, at
least they could amplify some titillating flaws. <!--See, this is exactly
what I was talking about above. He knows EVERYTHING about a character he's
not that interested in. I had no idea about Hawkeye. I was completely
clueless that such a character existed before the Aja / Fraction
collaboration.-->

	Regardless, I collected Hawkeye in the 80’s and early 90’s with his four
issue mini-series (a way of testing if the market will bear a longer running
solo title. It didn’t), and his eight issue attempt at a run in the early
00’s. I still have all the issues, but I never read them more than once. The
only time that Hawkeye ever became interesting for me was when Brian Michael
Bendis got ahold of him during his run on New Avengers, but even then the
only way to draw people in to his character was to kill him then completely
reinvent him – he had Hawkeye pose as a different masked, martial-arts based
character, Ronin, for a large portion of the series, with the big reveal that
it was Hawkeye who had been masquerading as a ninja ultimately coming as a
bit of a letdown once he went back to the quiver and rejoined the team. He
immediately went back to being second string.

	So, history dispensed with, when I saw Hawkeye reappear on my monthly
list of potential new titles, I skipped it altogether. When Dave wrote his
superfluous<!--This is one interesting piece to collaboration:
interpretation. Does Scott mean "superfluous" or is that a typo for superb?
Was the post superfluous? What the hell is he saying? He's right of course,
it was superfluous, but superbly so. This kind of interpretation of another's
ideas is a central claim of collaboration. One that's even more interesting
because the interpretation, at least in the case of Fraction and Aja, is
marked by a translation of words into images, or sketches into "drawings."
There's bound to be tons of these interpretive miscues, but they're hidden in
the final product--the polished, reviewed, and properly constructed artifice.
Of course, this is what I think's interesting about "commenting out" my
contribution here, because ultimately, collaboration is all about plummeting
the process into secrecy and revealing only the product.--> Pizza Dog
article, I got a little more intrigued. When I saw that the comics had jumped
in value quite a bit I kicked myself. And when I finally picked up and read
the first trade (with the clerk telling me “oh Hawkeye! That’s a great
series”), I was more than a little irritated that I’d let my previous
experience with the character get in the way of seeing him through what
turned out to be a provocative new lens. <!--Show you: always be open.
Experience is a dreadful thing-->And comics has a way of doing this,
experimenting with characters who have fallen out of favour by adding new
creative teams (to make a recommendation of my own, the currently running
Silver Surfer helmed by heavy hitters Dan Slott and Mike Allred exemplifies
exactly the same scenario).<!-- I totally agree with this recommendation.
Great series so far.-->

	And, to be fair, this isn’t Hawkeye. It can barely be called Clint
Barton. Matt Fraction and David Aja <!--Always interesting to me how many
people get excluded from the collaborative team. Matt Hollingsworth's work on
Hawkeye is total genius. But, most people don't acknowledge his contribution
to the product. The colour palette for Hawkeye has been one of the bright
spots in the collaboration to my mind. Also of note, this is the same team
that did Immortal Iron Fist a few years back and they rip a lot of their
artistic attitude from the way they approached that series. So, there's some
precedence for what they're up to that's hidden unless you know where to
look. And this is another thing about collaboration that's worth thinking
about--how collaboration is often a kind of build up of historical precedents
about working together and interpreting each other's moves. All that stuff is
hidden, but it's central to the outcomes. Getting the right people to do the
right things.-->getting their hands on the old, dusty franchise character
were given rarely offered complete creative control over him; and really,
when everyone expected the book to fail given the <strong>source</strong>
material, why not dabble in a way that really allows for the team’s
collaborative voice to come through? They’re seemingly aware of the challenge
as well - the repeated first line of every issue, “Okay, this looks bad,”
punningly references whatever awkward situation has been constructed for
Hawkeye but also working with the character himself, the two creators tasked
every issue with capturing their readers’ interest with no one’s favorite
Avenger. As Fraction <a
href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/17/hawkeye-matt-
fraction_n_3613441.html">himself stated</a>, "It's the book that should not
exist, so why not take the chances and do the experimenting?" And have they
ever – from near silent issues told from the perspective of Hawkeye’s rescued
dog to issues told entirely in sign language, Hawkeye has gone out of its way
to highlight the talents of both writer and artist<!-- and colourist!! Take a
look at the colour scheme for the Pizza Dog issue and the visible colour
spectrum for a canine. MIND BLOWN! That Hollingsworth is a masterful
bastard-->, almost to the degree that you have to admit that the character is
really just along for the ride – we see this expressed literally again and
again, as he’s picked up in different vehicles and driven around by Young
Avenger Kate Bishop, then by SHEILD, then by the mob, then offscreen by Tony
Stark, always totally confused and directionless. I’ve never seen a comic
that so obviously and actively refuses to let the character have any agency
whatsoever, nearly breaking the fourth wall at points in order to do so.

	This is, perhaps, a way of indicating that whatever Hawkeye turns out to
be, they’re willing to own it for better or worse.<!-- Of note too is that
Hawkeye doesn't actually do much Superhero-ing in this series. It's all about
his everyday life--very Seinfeld in approach. The series de-emphasizes that
very thing it would seem to need to reboot. In other words, you reboot the
franchise that features a Superhero with lame powers by avoiding the
showcasing of those lame powers.--> Fraction’s comedic turn with his
tracksuit dracula “bros” (one can’t help but think this is a current pop
culture reference to Pewdiepie and his “bro army”) and his consistent
gesturing towards the zaniness of the life of a superhero as told from the
perspective of the regular guy makes us engage more with Fraction than with
Clint – again, he’s always getting himself into trouble, avoiding problems
and never quite knowing what to say. Unlike most superhero comics, in Hawkeye
instead it’s the situation rather than the character that drives the plot,
and they emphasize this by even having him miss his targets in close range
target practice.<!--For sure a metaphor for how often this series has missed
its own targets. The final issues have been delayed and delayed and delayed,
now due out in January and February 2015. Hidden dialects again... Fraction's
too busy on his other collaboration with Chip to be bothered with Hawkeye.
--> Clint does have brief moments of heroism, but really, he could be any of
us. Very frequently he tells his neighbors to ignore the fact that he’s
“Hawkguy.” It’s almost as if, throughout, Fraction has found a way to write
anything but a superhero comic while making sure that it sells as it’s under
the Marvel brand name. Even when he does introduce the rest of the Marvel
Universe, he dispenses with it immediately by first having Clint black out
for the duration of the fight then by having him take a vacation.

	Looking at the same scene, Aja’s gritty but still simplified style,
reminiscent of David Mazzucchelli’s Batman run,<!--Scott being Scott again. I
hadn't even thought of that connection, but dammit if Scott didn't. And he's
totally correct. --> compliments the refusal to adhere to the genre as he
pans back from action shots to make the even the violence look, in a way,
pathetic. <!--Also very reminiscent of Steranko's run on Nick Fury. That's
where Aja gets a lot of his cool broken action stuff. --> Barton is always
getting hurt, as we rarely see heroes suffer (a broken pelvis? With three
weeks’ recovery? Ow), but Aja draws it in such a way to emphasize Clint’s
fragility – we’re deprived of the momentous “pows” and “biffs” of the
superhero fight scene, as Clint is beaten without fanfare in small frames,
often caught off guard, frequently being knocked immediately unconscious. As
acknowledged in the many, many podcasts and inter<strong>view</strong>s with
the pair (<a
href="http://traffic.libsyn.com/decompressed/Decompressed004.mp3">here's
one</a>), Fraction is playing to Aja’s talents as they play with every facet
of the medium, experimenting with transitions, hiding gags throughout and
generally having a lot of fun. <!--There's also the visual signatures of Aja
in the comic to go along with Fraction's own self-referential humour. The
band-aid on the nose and cheek is something Aja did on his Immortal Iron Fist
run and it carries over even into the New Avengers run lately. The visual
signature that sends us back to Aja. It's another cool hidden allusion that
signals not only Aja, but his collaboration with Hollingsworth and Fraction
on Immortal Iron Fist previously.-->

	And if Hawkeye is about anything, it’s this – giving a pair with the
credentials behind them a low stakes outlet to experiment with style, with
dialogue and with content without potentially upsetting Marvel’s broader
fanbase. They play to the mythos only as much as it suits them, which is
likely why is hasn’t ostracized readers unfamiliar with the genre, which is
likely why Dave found it so appealing<!--I found it appealing because the
drawing was awesome and the storylines, to me, reflected a direct reference
to the reader's tendency to judge things before they actually engage with
them. Like Scott did for instance. It seemed to me, as Scott has noted, that
there was an ironic finger to the reader with the "this looks bad" line. As
if they new readers wouldn't want to read it. And then they put together a
really superior product. It also appealed to me because the comic reflected a
kind of elitist / indie band attitude in its construction. Aja was really
slow; Fraction didn't seem to really give a shit; Hollingsworth is a dude;
and so on. The comic was an uncomic and more about a bunch of guys playing in
a garage on Sunday. I wish we had more books like this one and I wish the
ladies would get together and do one for Kate Bishop's Hawkeye.--> and why I
was averse to it at first. But though this has been something of an
experiment and though it’s not likely to be canon anytime soon, they’re
opening up the door for more creativity to be brought to the superhero comic,
providing it with an infusion of vitality that, as we’ve noted at graphixia,
is much needed if they’re to remain relevant to a broader audience.

	<!--And so we end. Hidden contributions and final constructions. It's not
always about interpreting the surfaces and the significations indicated by
such surfaces. Sometimes, there's the hidden or even, dare I say it, excluded
interfaces of collaboration--I'm looking at you Stan Lee. And, I think we
always need to think about the hidden cultural interfaces of collaboration.
For instance, how does race, gender, and our collective understanding of
these things--the ingrained presence of those kinds of cultural
assumptions--distort how we collaborate with others? Do we seek out our own
kind, or do we seek out others? In the case of Hawkeye, I think they sought
out there own. What we need is a different kind of collaboration--so, a Jew,
a black woman, and a bhuddist start writing a
comicbook...-->]]></content:encoded>

	I don't think anyone is "excluded" or "not acknowledged" when they're not
mentioned in standard reference phrases such as "Hawkeye by Fraction and Aja"
etc. The commented sentence says, "Matt Fraction and David Aja [...] were
given [...] complete creative control". Mentioning Hollingsworth in this
sentence would have been misleading, as the colourist's creative control over
a comic is usually not nearly as significant as that of writer and
penciller.]]></wp:comment_content>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Hey, Hattie --</em>

	<em>So I thought we could do this a little more conversationally than the
boys have done so far. Maybe in a series of notes back and forth?
Epistolary-styles? I don’t mind doing the uploading and formatting if that’s
easier on you. I think, since this is the last post before Christmas, we
should keep it casual and just pretend we’re chatting about All-Star Superman
by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely over a gin and tonic somewhere in
Leeds.</em>

	<em>So with that, I’ll start by asking you: what did you think? I know
you’re not usually a capes-and-tights gal, so I’m thrilled you signed on to
read this one with me. Morrison and Quitely are my favourite duo working in
comics, hands down. So: initial thoughts?</em>

	<em>xo B</em>

	<strong>Cheers Dr B, </strong>

	<strong>I have to admit I struggled a bit. For about the first thirty
pages I kept muttering to myself “But how has Lois not realised that Clark
Kent is Superman and Superman is Clark Kent, is she really stupid?” But then,
almost despite myself, I started to quite enjoy the book. I was worried that
the fact I have read precisely ZERO other Superman comics might cause me a
few issues but it really didn’t. I am sure there are lots of things I didn’t
pick up on but I didn’t feel too much of an outsider as I read the book. As
for Morrison and Quitely, a quick scan of a an online encyclopedia confirms
that this is the first Morrison and Quitely comic I have ever read. I had a
few niggles when I started reading it but we can come back to that later… So,
how about you? What were your initial thoughts?</strong>

	<em>One of the reasons I floated this by you is because I think it stands
alone well and is a good comic for people who don’t think they’re
capes-and-tights people. Morrison is really good at characters who are
flawed. I never liked Superman comics as a kid for the same reason I never
liked Batman -- everything seemed too easy when your superpowers are
EVERYTHING and BEING RICH, respectively. When I came across this run, I was
thrilled, because Superman is so fallible here. He can be wounded. There is
something so compelling about a Superman who can be wounded, don’t you
think?</em>

	<a

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4072"

859x1024.jpg" alt="gas-allstar-02" width="600" height="715" /></a>

	<strong>Absolutely, and I think like you this was one of the reasons why
I struggle with Batman and Superman comics and why I enjoyed this so much.
After I got over my frustration at how obtuse Lois Lane appears to be it was
definitely this new vulnerability that kept me engaged. I particularly
enjoyed the parts from Episode Six (and here’s where I will indulge in some
spoilers) where the multiple different Supermans(men?) come together to work
as a team. I found myself very moved by the death of Jonathan Kent in a way
that I really did not expect to be coming into this book. I found seeing that
emotional vulnerability playing out against the story of his physical
vulnerability particularly effective. Are there any sections or episodes you
really enjoyed above others?</strong>

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/
all_star_superman__1_origins.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full
wp-image-4073"

all_star_superman__1_origins.jpg" alt="all_star_superman__1_origins"
width="420" height="663" /></a>

	<em>My favourite bit in the whole book is actually the second page of
Episode 1, where we get the entire backstory of Superman in four panels. I
thought that was really expertly done. It also acknowledges Superman’s role
in certainly North American culture -- no one doesn’t know where Superman
comes from, and it’s a remarkably consistent narrative compared to a
character like Wolverine for example. So why rehash it? Four panels, eight
words. That page, to me, is a really magical examples of comics doing what
comics do best: using the visual to tell the story to best effect.</em>

	<em>That segues pretty nicely into talking about the collaboration
between Morrison and Quitely, maybe? What did you think of how they worked
together on this one? For me, the biggest tell that these two guys are
totally in sync is Clark Kent. Have you ever seen a more bumbling, frumpy,
loser-ish Clark Kent? This is the first comic where I’ve ever bought the
secret identity malarky because it’s clear from Quitely’s careful development
of the character -- perfectly in line with Morrison’s story -- that Clark
Kent has to work really flipping hard to stay incognito. It’s not just
glasses; it’s the way he holds himself in space. Very effective.</em>

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2404518-
fqallstarsuperman2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4076"

fqallstarsuperman2.jpg" alt="2404518-fqallstarsuperman2" width="600"
height="301" /></a>

	<strong>I have to admit that within the first few pages I was complaining
to a friend about how much I disliked Quitely’s art and Morrison’s dialogue.
Having finished the book I changed my mind completely about the former and
mostly about the latter. I still find Morrison’s dialogue a bit heavy and
clunky at points, but re-reading parts before writing this post helped change
my mind further, in particular the scene where Lois and Superman are having
dinner and discussing his big identity reveal. However I could have done
without it being quite so expositional at crucial moments, there are ways
they could have conveyed the same information visually or with more nuanced
dialogue.</strong>

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AllStarSuperman-004.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4075"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AllStarSuperman-004-
642x1024.jpg" alt="AllStarSuperman-004" width="642" height="1024" /></a>

	<strong>As for Quitely’s art, I particularly enjoy the way he uses the
panels and their position on the page to reinforce and reflect what is
happening within their confines. Just occasionally a panel is slightly off
kilter or drops a bit and you barely notice it but it makes the pages so full
of movement and fills me with joy about the possibilities of comics. I’ve
just gone back to look out for examples of your point above, I hadn’t
consciously remarked on it before but now you’ve pointed it out I just want
to squeal with how perfectly it is done!</strong>

	<em>Yay! I also really like how Quitely can move us one moment, like with
the way Clark Kent’s face falls through the eulogy, and then give us broad
slapstick old-school imagery, like on the Bizarro planet (how much did you
laugh watching Superman try to control the bizarros?). It’s not a perfect
comic (is there such a beast?), but I’m genuinely impressed by the way
Morrison’s slightly stilted style and Quitely’s square jaws and reserve
manage to evoke the Golden Age of comics while still crafting a story that
feels utterly contemporary.</em>

	<em>We’d better wrap this up before the boys tell us off for being late.
Any final thoughts?</em>

	<strong>Not much other than a thank you for pushing me to read something
outside my usual taste, I had forgotten how much I do enjoy reading
Superheroey comics and have a distinct tendency to avoid DC Comics in
general, so this has been an ace experience all round!</strong>

	<em>Score one for collaboration!</em>

	And Merry Happy to all our Graphixia readers.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Intro from
Paddy</h2> This contribution by myself and Benoît to the Graphixia series on
collaboration takes a slightly different angle to the others. We thought it
would be interesting to examine the nature of Richard McGuire’s <em>Here
</em>in light of its reissue and expansion into a 300-page book from a
six-page short story, and to explore the nature of our own collaborations as
much as those of the text itself. Our discussion of a single creator will, we
hope, provide something of a counterpoint to the surrounding discussions of
writer and artist collaborators, but I think our discussion has also
highlighted another way of thinking about collaboration, to which I pose a
question: is it possible for one to collaborate with oneself? I put it to you
that Richard McGuire has done just that with his new edition of
<em>Here</em>, updating his previous work for a new and expanded format.
We’ve also collaborated ourselves in an interesting way, with Benoît tackling
the 1988 comic and me tackling the 2014 book. So, without further ado…
<h2>Benoît</h2> Richard McGuire's “Here” benefits from such a cult status in
North-America and Europe that it is almost puzzling for a work of this
length. Few of the short works published in <em>RAW</em> have found such a
critical recognition as the original six-page “Here” story. Published in
1989, at the height of a ‘graphic novel revolution,’ its shortness and lack
of narrative might even come across as a bold statement in the context of
widespread talks on the ‘potentialities’ of the form. “Here” is clearly the
work that most conspicuously demonstrated the specific affordances of comics
to represent time, and the idea of charting the entire history of a place has
obviously been set forth by Chris Ware. This kinship is not only clear in
<em>Building Stories </em>(2012), but the cartoonist repeatedly refers to it
in interviews and has even written an essay (“A Grateful Appreciation”)
setting out his views on McGuire's comic. As Ware points out in his essay,
Robert Crumb's “A Short History of America” was an antecedent to “Here,” but
McGuire's comic nonetheless push the experiment farther, “towards finding a
sort of new poetry of the form itself”, as Ware puts it (6).

	“Here” records the history of a single room through embedded panels
overlapping each other within the regular structure of a conventional
six-panel grid. Each panel represents the same location from the same
perspective, with a superposition and juxtaposition of other panels that
stand for different moments within an extremely wide span of time (none other
than what the scientists call ‘deep time’). The jumps back and forth and the
multiplication of panels transform the comics page into a crowded field where
narrative meaning retreats into the ‘micro-dialogues’ that the reader is
invited to build between the discrete elements that constitute this network
of images. The most flagrant principle of comics that “Here” is overriding is
also the most entrenched, that of sequentiality. Barely three years after
Will Eisner praised comics as sequential art – a phrase that would quickly
become virtually synonymous with the form – McGuire published a comic that
simply did away with the sequence as the central aspect of comics
storytelling. Of course, “Here” does not simply liquidate the sequence: the
grid invites to a sequential reading with a non-chronological ordering of the
‘events,’ but ultimately not much is gained from a strict panel-to-panel kind
of sequence. What “Here” favors, through its multiplication of embedded
panels, is a permanent back-and-forth.

	&nbsp;

	<a

class="aligncenter  wp-image-4090"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/V9cfN-689x1024.jpg"
alt="V9cfN" width="499" height="742" /></a>Today, the critical view of comics
as a network is much more widespread, not the least through the English
translation of Thierry Groensteen's <em>The System of Comics</em>. In a 1992
article, the same Groensteen published the results of an amusing experiment
of his, consisting in cutting out every panel of “Here” in order to arrange
them in a chronological sequence. This little cut-and-paste exercise quickly
led him to conclude that ordering the panels chronologically didn't further
the understanding of a particular narrative. McGuire radically does away with
the conventions of traditional narrative in order to emphasize the
insignificance, smallness, and ephemerality of human lives when seen from
such a large temporal perspective. But it also entices the readers to draw
unexpected relationships allowed by the simultaneous co-existence of these
various panels, reading moments of contrasts and connexions: an old man
disguised as an Indian, a kid playing with a dinosaur toy ironically connect
with a ‘real-life’ stegosaur and Native American.

	This network-like organization, the reader's investment in virtually
reshuffling the discrete panels, and the resistance to an action-driven
narrative are aspects of Richard McGuire's “Here” that bear striking
affinities with digital reading practices. Not surprisingly, the artist told,
in an interview with Thierry Smolderen, that he got his inspiration from
hearing someone describe the Windows program: <p style="padding-left:
30px">The seed of the idea came from the apartment I had just moved into. I
was thinking of who may have lived there before. I did some sketches of a
split screen where time was moving forward on the left and backwards on the
right. […] it was a comment [a friend of mine] made about the Windows program
that got me thinking it could be a multi-view instead of the split screen.
That was the eureka moment. The idea is a multi-dimensional view of time–not
to think of time as linear, but of all time existing simultaneously. I wanted
the viewer to think about the bigger picture, that what we experience is only
part of the reality. Dinosaurs are still walking around in this space but in
another time (23).</p> Perhaps the cult status of “Here” owes to the fact
that it honed the network-like structure of the form in a way that enhances
the affordances of the medium at an early stage of computer development.

	My curiosity about the 2014 version, then, is to see how McGuire managed
the sweeping ‘digital revolution.’ Looking at his “Time Warp” cover for
T<em>he</em> <em>New Yorker</em>, it is clear that the changed media
landscape must have impacted his works, but it also demonstrates how
innovative, and perhaps forecasting, his 1989 comic was. <em>Here
</em>simultaneously comes out as a hardcover and an e-book, and I'm curious
about how the e-book works–if it is ‘interactive’ (all clicking, shuffling,
and that kind of stuff)–or if it is ‘simply’ a digitized version. But also,
what kind of experience is reading a 300-page version of “Here”? If one has
to cut up the panels and re-arrange them into a sequence, as Groensteen did,
in order to get a better idea of the various moments and storylines that the
comic establishes, what about a full-fledged graphic novel? How does McGuire
evince the overflow of information? Is <em>Here </em>a kind of big data, too
large and complex to be processed? Or is <em>Here </em>an attempt to
narrativize “Here”? <h2>Paddy</h2> That’s a lot of questions! But I think I
have the answers to them, having just read through the beautiful hardback
edition of <em>Here</em> for the second time. One thing to note, however: I
wasn’t able to get hold of the ebook version. I was under the impression they
would be released simultaneously, but the release date is listed as January
29<sup>th</sup> <a
href="http://www.penguin.co.uk/books/here/9780241203729/">on UK publisher
Penguin’s website</a>, and this is reflected in the UK iBookstore, despite it
being available in the US iBookstore, for reasons I cannot fathom. So I won’t
be able to comment fully on how the new edition engages with the digital
revolution in this post, but I’m sure we’ll get a decent Twitter discussion
going once I’ve read it, and also once <em>Here</em> has reached the shores
of Belgium. Reviews and commentary such as <a
href="http://www.wired.com/2014/12/here-graphic-novel-richard-mcguire/">this
Wired piece</a> on the new edition suggest that the ebook is highly
interactive, and explores the book’s various depictions of and engagement
with time and temporality by allowing for grouping of years or various panels
into logical chronological sequences – a digitized version of Groensteen’s
1992 experiment which, to my mind, succinctly illustrates the impact of
digital technology on reading as a whole, as well as the potential for comics
to experiment with the medium whilst still remaining, essentially, comics.

	As Benoît suggests, though, it is clear that developments in digital
technology have influenced the expansion of <em>Here</em> into a full-length
hardcover book, as there are smartphones and screens depicted in the years
surrounding the date of the book’s release. However, I don’t believe, aside
from the interactive ebook edition, that the content of the comic has been
affected in any significant way by digital culture. Or, to put it another
way, had <em>Here</em> been expanded into a full-length graphic novel in the
1990s or 2000s, or at any period in time with or without the changes we’ve
seen in digital culture, the end result of the content would have been the
same: <em>Here </em>(along with “Here”) is a non-linear, expansive exercise
in world-building (a term I use deliberately to invoke Dylan Horrocks’ essay
“<a href="http://www.hicksville.co.nz/PerfectPlanet.htm">The Perfect
Planet</a>”) and exploration of representations of time, through the medium
of graphic narrative, and its status as such is unaffected by digital
developments.

	That answers, in part, Benoît’s question about whether <em>Here </em>is
an attempt to narrativize “Here,” the answer to which is no. There are some
small episodes and vignettes contained within <em>Here </em>which develop
more naturally and in a more linear, chronological fashion than would have
been possible within the original six-page strip: for example, a joke is told
in 1989 over a series of square panels on consecutive pages, while various
prehistoric scenes erupt around the panels and fill the double page spreads.
The expanded page count allows for a much greater number of micronarratives
and vignettes to unfold: a father and son meet after some years in 1775 and
find, as expected, that they can’t see eye to eye; an arrow flies straight
and hits its target in 1402; and a family poses on the sofa for photos, and
we watch them age over various panels, randomly interjected into other
scenes, some of which develop and some of which don’t – the entire spectrum
of Scott McCloud’s panel transitions is represented in <em>Here</em>, without
a doubt.

	A concession is made to the demand for more of a narrative payoff
inherent in the graphic novel format, but I must admit that on my first
reading it was lost on me, which is telling when we consider the nature of
the comic and its exploration of time and world-building. The book begins
with the room empty in 2014, followed by a woman in 1957 wondering why she
entered the room. She is swiftly lost in the unfolding scenes, but she
returns in the final few pages, with the penultimate spread depicting her
answering her own question with an “ah yes…now I remember.” What it is she
remembers will, of course, never be made clear, and this lack of resolution,
this almost-dénouement, is the essence of both “Here” and <em>Here</em>:
whether she remembers or not, her existence is a small, framed section of a
much, much wider canvas of space and time – perhaps, to borrow an idea from
Scott McCloud, an infinite one.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/McGuire.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4091"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/McGuire.jpg"
alt="McGuire" width="450" height="321" /></a>

	When I say the narrative payoff was lost on me, what I mean is that when
I reached the final pages of the book, I had entirely forgotten that woman in
1957’s opening words, and as such did not perceive any closure to her final
words – I had to return to the opening pages, and skim through the book
again, to remind myself of her previous actions and appearances. Rather than
taking in a particular straightforward narrative, I had instead been taken in
by the sense of infinity, of the wider canvas, of the imagined world, of the
perfect distillation of the machinations of space and time, and this is the
book’s great success: it manages to be a microcosm of so much of our own
lived experience, in a universal and elegant fashion.

	McGuire’s update of his own work, therefore, is simply the shorter story
writ large; a single remixed into a double-disc concept album, if you will;
an expansion and improvement upon an existing text; a collaboration between
texts, between time, between space, between pictures, between words. <em>Here
</em>has achieved its almost universal acclaim for its success in realizing
all of these seen and unseen collaborations, and it really works well as a
300 page book. It would work well as a 600 or even a 1000 page book. In fact,
it could go on forever – there would always be stories of that one space
depicted to be told, always things to be updated. World-building is never
finished, but McGuire certainly gets us halfway there. <h4>Works Cited</h4>

don’t know anything about the comics produced in a particular country and
then proceed to write about them? This post seeks to find the answer to that
question, as I look at the Korean manhwa <i>XS</i> by Song Ji-Hyung. My
expertise tends towards Japanese manga rather than manhwa, which is to say
that I have read a few examples of manga and absolutely none of manhwa.

Europe, or Japan. We are trying to read and write about things outside our
comfort zone, from a position of exploration rather than knowledge. I settled
on manhwa because I felt I could relate it to my manga reading experience. I
was grateful for the discrete, limited manhwa section on the Dark Horse iOS
app. There were four or five different titles to choose from, and I went for
the one that looked to me the most enjoyable which turned out to be
<i>XS</i>. It occurs to me that I may have chosen <i>XS</i> because it looked
the most familiar to me. So much for exploring new territory.

	The first thing I realized when I read <i>XS</i> was that I would be hard
pressed to distinguish it from manga. The page breakdown tends to fracture
the page like manga; the sound effects look like manga sound effects; urban
architectural panels have a manga look to them, if not quite as precisely
detailed; faces and hairstyles look like those stereotypically found in
manga, even when they transform visually from the characters’ cool personae
into exponents of childish rage, a typical manga trope. Reading direction
seems to be the only notable difference between the Korean and Japanese
comics experience: manhwa reads left to right typically, not right to left.

	Tom Ormsby at <a
href="https://mangamarket.wordpress.com/2011/01/15/whats-manhwa/">Manga
Market</a> helps us out a little: <blockquote>Although manhwa and manga share
many similarities, it is often easy to distinguish between them. Some of the
main differences are as follows:

	-Manhwa books mostly read from left to right.

	-The manhwa art style tends to put more emphasis on the eyes and face of
characters.

	-Character’s figures tend to have more realistic proportions.

	-There is often a more frequent use of gradient “screen
tone”.</blockquote> I’m not entirely convinced by this, but what do I know?

	So, here I was, trying to expand my horizons by reading Korean comics,
but I could find nothing particularly Korean about <i>XS</i> in terms of its
appearance<i>.</i> The book is set in Korea and makes a few Korean
references, but that’s it as far as I could notice. Perhaps the Korean
elements of <i>XS</i> are hidden to those who have not studied Korean culture
and history. What would happen if someone unschooled in Canadian history and
culture looked at Canadian comics? Quite likely, they would not be able to
distinguish them from American comics. And yet, Bart Beaty or Jason Dittmer
can identify what makes  Captain Canuck quite different from Captain America.

	<i>XS</i> is a sci-fi adventure comic. It features tons of chases through
the street as the main character, Huin Chang, tries to evade various pursuers
on his Aprilia motorbike. You might get a headache from all the motion lines.
In fact, I found the chase, fight, and crash scenes spectacular in the way
they developed increasing abstraction. They become almost sublime, making it
difficult to identify body and automobile parts at the height of the action.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sublime-Manhwa.jpg">

alt="Sublime Manhwa" width="640" height="480" /></a>

	Speed, testosterone, and violence trump plot development or dialogue. We
have to be patient in our reading to figure out why all these fights and
crashes are occurring. Even then, it’s kind of blurry, probably intentionally
so.

	Everything revolves around Huin Chang, a punk kid who likes his
motorcycles and his skateboards. Chang is a cool kid, handy in a fight,
protective of his girlfriend Mina, who, it turns out is from the USA. A
spiky-haired mod-looking guy wreaks havoc in an airport in the US, on some
sort of espionage mission (?)  before returning to Korea. A mysterious street
hood, keeps trying to kidnap Mina, requiring heroic action from Chang.
Americans in a Cadillac chase Chang through the streets, having identified
him as being significant to them for reasons not divulged by the place I am
in the series. Eventually, we discover that the mod, the hood, Mina, and
Chang himself are “hybrids,” which means that some other entity, in the form
of a computer virus, has lodged itself in each of their brains, like a
parasite in their host bodies:  Mina doesn't know this herself until towards
the end of the first volume. In fact, Mina turns out to be a figure named
"Kali" based on the Hindu goddess. It's all very confusing, but fun. The
series is not yet complete, so it's impossible to tell how it all works out.
Up to volume 3 has been published by Dark Horse.

	The kind of possession that being a "hybrid" invokes is one of my
favourite sci-fi tropes. It suggests the "something in me more than myself"
of Lacanian psychoanalysis, and is ripe for allegorical reading.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Parasite.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4104"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Parasite.jpg"
alt="Parasite" width="310" height="439" /></a>

	For what can posession be but a metaphor for colonization, occupation by
another or a lack of self-knowledge, as our opaque selves act in ways that
defy our conscious understanding. XS is both a formal and cultural allegory
for the posession of Korea by Japan and, the United states. The form of
manhwa that XS manifests is a "hybrid" in the way it is occupied and
possessed by Japanese manga, echoing Korea's own occupation by Japan in World
War II. The opaque self aspect of this allegory is that the occupation is not
only welcome but self-inflicted.  Again, I am reminded of how Canadian comics
copy American comics even in the effort to come up with something distinctly
Canadian in opposition to the standard superhero of American comics, at least
in terms of form. Captain Canuck is different from American superheroes in
the way that he acts not in the way he appears, like a body builder in a
leotard with his briefs on the outside. If comics is a language with
different dialects, Canadian comics speak "American" and Korean manhwa, or
this one in particular, speaks "Japanese."

	One would have to know more about Korea and its relations to Japan than
me to be able to assert whether any kind of cultural disruption is taking
place, where Korea is somehow the parasite feeding off the Japanese host. I
do know that Chang chastizes the street hood for driving a "Jap rocket" and
that he invokes the "Japanese school girl cliche."

	A character who appears towards the end of volume 3: Shin Jiha is said to
have just arrived from "Japland."

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Japland.jpg"><img

src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Japland.jpg"

	These moments suggest a hostility and anxiety toward Japan.

	The expression "damn Yankees" appears a couple of times.

	The American role in the allegory that I am constructing is more opaque.
They seem to be in the position of secretly controlling the action, and they
appear to be after Mina/Kali. In fact, the Americans appear in the content of
the comic somewhat like Japan does in the form. Omnipresent, secretive.

	Chang meanwhile is Korea embodied: heroic, adventurous, but kept in the
dark, unable to figure out what his position is in relation to a plot that is
too complex for him to comprehend. All he can do is fight, defend Mina (who
actually appears to be far more powerful than he is), and be cool.

	The great thing about allegorical readings of texts that may or may not
be allegorical, and when one doesn't know the culture that the allegory might
refer to, is that they are fantasies of comprehension, control, and power.
 In the space of three volumes, I move from total ignorance of manhwa to
explain how it works in relation to Japan and the United States. Suddenly, I
am master of the universe.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Jeff Lemire is
something of a chameleon – unlike most of comics’ author / illustrators, he
never seems to shy away from a particular genre in the medium. My exposure to
his work has been predominantly through his efforts with DC comics in
<i>Animal Man</i>, <i>Sweet Tooth</i>, the recent (and very underrated)
<i>Trillium</i> and (the sadly not underrated enough) <i>Justice League
United</i>. More superhero oriented, these series show him to have a nuanced
interpretation of protagonists in his creation of deeply flawed characters
and problematic relationships; but instead of trying to find ideals, as most
superhero stories do, he reminds us of the import of subjectivity in the
human experience and that one’s interpretation of heroism depends on what’s
needed in one’s life at the time. This approach oddly makes it easier to
identify with his stories, regardless of how farfetched some of them might
be, as his characterization and thematic development are gritty, morose and
(like his art at points, as Peter pointed out) ugly.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/essex_county-722666.
jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3864"

src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/essex_county-722666-
224x300.jpg" width="224" height="300" /></a>Lemire’s much lauded Canadiana
trilogy <i>Essex County</i> deals with these concepts writ large through
shattering - and ultimately broadening - our concept of what it means to be a
member of a family. The story is suggestive of multiple approaches to
identity formation that allow the reader to choose which motivator Lemire
thinks is most important as influenced by outside forces (though he certainly
takes nurture over nature for granted). The most obvious of these, almost
cloyingly so, is through nationalistic pursuits. When reading <i>Essex
County</i>, it’s easy to see its glaring focus on what it means to be
Canadian through stereotypes that oddly hit home – the LeBeufs are very much
a hockey family, and they quite clearly derive their understanding of
heroism, masculinity and identity through the sport (the alternative we’re
presented with, almost as Canadian, is the Papineau family whose identity
comes from working the land). Most of the interactions reference hockey in
some way, even when the focus is on a lack of interaction; when Lester denies
his uncle some much needed family time in front of a Bruins game, he still
heads downstairs to watch Hockey Night in Canada on his own. <i>Essex County
</i>is so Canadian that it will allow its characters isolation from bloodline
yet not from its national pastime, almost as if doing so would be too
farfetched. That young Lester looks for identity in heroism through hockey is
unsurprising, however, as he can’t find it anywhere else in his life – every
other character he encounters is reluctant or damaged or both. Lou, his
unsung father, is a stereotypical hockey playing Canadian who almost made it
save for the fact that he has been crippled and made simple through an
accident on the ice – an accident that reveals Lou is so Canadian that he
cannot force himself to regret the injury – and who Lester looks to as a
father figure seemingly only because of his past abilities in the rink. <p
style="text-align: left;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/jeff-lemire.jpg"><
img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3853" alt="jeff-lemire"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/jeff-lemire-300x152.
jpg" width="300" height="152" /></a>Lester pursues identity through drawing
comic books as well, creating his inspiring heroes instead of looking for
them in his environment – and there is a sort of crossover here, as in
Lester’s superhero fantasies that involve Jimmy, he’s always dressed in his
hockey uniform to mirror the cape and mask that Lester himself wears.
Spending his youth in costume, Lester seeks heroism through his own actions
as well; however, he eventually gives this up to continue his drawing,
creating fictions to mask the flaws he finds in his rural reality that he
attempts to share with others, attempting to establish connection through
storytelling. Nationalism through hockey and superheroes in <i>Essex
County</i> becomes the safety net that catches us when blood fails – Lester,
Jimmy, Mary and nearly every other character in the narrative lacks an
understanding of their lineage. Familial paths cross consistently in the
County, however these are serendipitous and normally go unacknowledged by the
characters themselves. Lester’s chance meeting of his great uncle (or perhaps
his grandfather, we’re never quite sure as Lemire implies one lineage through
his dialogue and another through his art) in a snow covered field in the
country dark is extremely revealing of this – neither is aware of who the
other is, and both are struggling to find themselves either through the
circular process of “going home” and “running away” (319).</p> <p
style="text-align: left;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/essex1.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3863" alt="essex1"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/essex1.jpg"
width="413" height="591" /></a>The tragedy here is that both verbally
acknowledge that they shouldn’t be alone when doing so, but neither offers to
help the other – each instead heads on his own way. There is a bitter irony
here, and a scathing criticism of our need to find ourselves solely through
ourselves; <i>Essex County</i> is not a story of missed but <i>ignored</i>
connections, and every character suffers because of it.</p> So when blood
fails to help his characters find comfort or identity, Lemire suggests
history instead, tracing back several generations of Essex County’s
collective past. There is something of a revelation in his depiction, as he
re-humanizes history from its frequent glossing over as a collection of rote
facts: in his formation of the County over a hundred years prior, as
everywhere, there is as much ambiguity of parentage and familial identity as
there is in its present. As Dave points out, however, the only omniscience in
the story comes in the form of the bird, an icon of the natural world that
carries the truth of our lineages because there is too much uncertainty in
our brief lives to do so ourselves - trying to do so is overwhelming. We see
this again and again in <em>Essex County</em>, poignantly in the repeated
image of the river and the events that take place over the centuries both on
its shores and in the hockey games on the river itself when it freezes over.
When Lou, trying to reconnect with his brother and family line, submerges
himself here, he chokes and becomes lost in its depths:

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/essex.gif"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3862" alt="essex"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/essex.gif"
width="750" height="1020" /></a>

	The river as a natural image connecting generations might be a bit
cliche, but here Lemire works it quite well in showing that it's too powerful
for us to ever really make use of in any productive way. All we have is the
cultural moment in which to pursue ourselves and make meaningful connections
with others. History, if only because of its scope, fails to be able to allow
us to come to terms with identity.

	When we are introduced to hockey at the beginning of the graphic novel,
it seems as if it’s a poor substitute for history, family, identity,
aspiration and life in general. However by casting a dark pallor over the
rest of his characters’ lives (not the least of which lies in the fraternal
betrayal that results in dubious parentage), it becomes by comparison a
necessary component of what it means to be Canadian and, more generally, a
human being. And this seems to be what Lemire is driving at: identity and
family are flawed concepts at best, and we need to find solace in
nationalistic, collective pursuits if we’re to find anything at all. This
realization seems to be unironic and ultimately satisfactory in attempting to
find oneself – a fact that is underscored by a photo of Lemire as a young boy
in a hockey uniform for the “about the author” final page of the collected
edition of <em>Essex County</em>.

	What we are left with are Lemire’s typically flawed characters, driven to
self imposed isolation, unknowingly connected through their landscape and
blood but consciously connected through nationalistic pursuits. The reader
understands the fragile, tenuous connections between these quiet lives in a
way that the characters themselves never will, much in the same way that in
our own lives we can’t see through the mesh of subjectivity that isolates us
and divorces us from an understanding of our larger role in a historical,
linear context. But it’s there nonetheless, and the roots of Canadian culture
run as deep in <i>Essex County</i> as they ostensibly do in the rest of the
country, even if they are too deep to be consciously perceived. We connect
with others instead through the seemingly surface stories and stats of hockey
and superheroes, and that might be why these stories are such an improbably
important part of our culture. Narratives of heroism, through hockey or
otherwise, are simply more easily understood and shared. One might find this
a humble, sad testament, but Lemire’s story of a fractured family line that
ultimately comes (sort of) together shows that these more surface stories
don’t create connections but instead <i>reveal</i> them, even if we don’t
understand their complexities. They create a common language that gives us an
excuse to express ourselves, to establish our identities and ultimately to
love one another even against difficult odds.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[After I read <i>Essex
County</i> for the first time last month, following Peter’s first post about
it, I tweeted that I saw Jeff Lemire as “The Raymond Carver of Comics.” It’s
not always that valuable to make such cross-form comparisons, but it’s not a
comparison I made lightly, and I think it hints at shared qualities that
reveal something about our understanding of the central elements of comics –
time and space as rendered in images, text and panels – and how Jeff Lemire
puts them to use in <i>Essex County</i>. It’s also a comparison made by
Darwyn Cooke in his introduction to the collected edition, which I skipped on
my first reading but was pleased to note when I re-read the book in
preparation for this post. “With a casual grace that would make the late
Raymond Carver envious,” writes Cooke, “Lemire’s stories build out of
innocuous and seemingly unconnected moments that gather and gain weight when
viewed in a cumulative light.” (5)

	Lemire’s talent for the subtle, for the expert rendering of that which
lies beneath the surface, has been discussed in this series already. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/07/02/173-men-without-women-jeff-
lemires-essex-county-hockey-and-mythical-canadian-masculinity/">Peter
Wilkins</a> and <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/07/28/176-the-roots-of-canadian-
identity-in-lemires-essex-county/">Scott Marsden</a> have both examined
Lemire’s treatment of Canadian identity, which is the all-consuming backdrop
of <i>Essex County</i> and an undeniably influential presence, running
throughout the book’s narrative; <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/07/15/174-the-line-in-jeff-lemires-
essex-county-a-topographic-poetics-for-comics/">David N. Wright</a> discussed
Lemire’s lines, and reminded us of “how the line reflects both a hinge to the
construction of narrative and the creative mark that the line represents to
the artist”; and <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/07/22/175-canadian-superheroics-in-
jeff-lemires-essex-county/">Brenna Clarke Gray</a> discussed Canadian
superheroics, pitting Lester’s made-up alter ego Power Man against his
humdrum rural reality, his cape masking his own fear and the trauma of his
mother’s death.

	As is often the case with analyses of Carver, and similar writers such as
Alice Munro (whose Canadian landscapes I also felt were echoed in <i>Essex
County</i>), looking at and understanding <i>Essex County</i> is as much
about what is not said and what is not told, as what is. Perhaps more so.
“What is not said” applies equally to the images as it does to the text and
the dialogue – perhaps, as we’re looking at a comic, we can think of “what is
not drawn.” This can extend not just to whatever elements of a depicted scene
we perceive to be significantly absent, but to Lemire’s visual style and the
choices made in inking, line thickness, and the interplay between black and
white, as well as his overall decision to work in black and white, which is
likely to be significantly informed by his own time, resources and finances
as a cartoonist working alone in this instance, but still can be seen as a
decision in keeping with the overall feel of <i>Essex County</i>. What is not
said and what is not drawn work together as an imagetext, creating a subtle
and unique portrait of Canadian life and Canadian identity.

	Lemire’s visual style is the key to this symbiosis. His lines are often
ratty, like Gary Panter working on a larger scale with more breathing room.
The brushstrokes of Lemire’s inking are broad, and he’s not afraid to use
them to cast long shadows, a regular occurrence which results in them
becoming a motif for the hidden, the unspoken. Bodies are somewhat angular,
particularly their faces, in which eyes are mostly small black circles,
hinting at the depth and pain in the characters’ minds behind them but giving
little away. Cross-hatching is often eschewed in favour of large black spaces
and black fills, emphasizing the shape of objects and elements as opposed to
the detail interiors – again, the reader is shown simple exteriors, left to
extrapolate and imagine and speculate on what lies beneath and inside the
shapes and lines on the surface of the objects.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Essex-County-12.jpg"
><img class="size-full wp-image-3873 aligncenter" alt="Essex County 12"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Essex-County-12.jpg"
width="445" height="653" /></a>

	In the above, for example, the sky beneath Lester as he imagines himself
flying away from the farm where he lives with his uncle is almost literally a
blank canvas – nothing but white space, unencumbered by details that could
have been included, such as clouds or other textures. Lester’s desire to
escape from his farmhouse is clear, of course, from the fact that he is
speeding away from it. His body fills the majority of the first panel and
breaks the frames, hinting at freedom briefly before he is again constrained
by a full panel at the moment his uncle calls his name. Again, besides
Lester’s figure and the dialogue, there is nothing in this panel except white
space, leaving his uncle’s calling to take the place of the background. We
are given only one word and no visual backdrop – so much is not said, and so
much is not drawn, but from this we are given a portrait of the emptiness and
bleakness of Lester’s life, of the silence of rural Canada which permeates
throughout <i>Essex County</i>.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Essex-County-333.jpg
"><img class="size-full wp-image-3874 aligncenter" alt="Essex County 333"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Essex-County-333.jpg"
width="446" height="641" /></a>

	Similarly, in the above image there is much said and much we can
extrapolate from the silence and from what is not drawn. The Canadian
landscape viewed from Lou’s porch is reduced to his deck and a few short,
clipped brushstrokes, carrying with them the weight of his family history,
invaded by the recurring presence of the crow, which speaks a sole “Kaw!”
here, a rare communication with the characters, breaking its streak of
appearances outside the main narrative of the story where it exists largely
as an onlooker. This breaks, briefly, the feelings of detachment and distance
which are created by the silence in Lemire’s landscapes, bringing them home
to roost on Lou’s porch. The silence is also broken by the pt-pt-pt sound of
the crow’s feet on the ground, one of the few instances of verbal depiction
of sound in <i>Essex County</i>, which is also striking against the silent
backdrop established over the previous 300 pages.

	Lou smiles back at the crow, and then the chapter is finished. This
exchange follows a series of thought bubbles in which Lou tells himself
“…there are only two ways to be completely alone in this world…lost in a
crowd…or in total isolation. And here I am…alone again.” (331-332) As soon as
he is finished thinking, however, the crow appears to remind him that he is
not alone, and his smile and brief communication with the crow implies that
he knows he is not alone, that his Canadian life is not all silence, despite
his initial assertions to the contrary.

	As with Carver, where much of the depicted world is silent, that which
breaks the silence finds great significance. It is in this aspect of
storytelling that Lemire excels, using such elements as the crow to emphasise
the positive messages hidden in the complex narratives of <i>Essex County,
</i>which can seem bleak at times. It is a comic characterized by loneliness,
and by silence – but it is not without warmth and not without sound, and it
is in the breaks in the silence that we find the heart of Lemire’s <i>Essex
County</i>.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

	I’ve been meaning to read <em>Essex County</em> for years and somehow
never got round to transferring it into my basket on any shopping trip. So I
was rather glad that the Canadian Contingent of Graphixia assigned us reading
for this cycle of posts. I duly ordered my copy and prepared to be engrossed.
It was around about this time I found out that my sort of Canadian
grandmother had passed away. As a result I’ve spent a significant amount of
the past month musing on my relationship with her and my own Canadian
heritage, my Father was born and spent much of his childhood in the Saint
Laurent suburb of Montreal. This musing has gone hand in hand with my
thoughts about <em>Essex County</em> and how I, as a Canadian Studies student
and sort of Canadian, feel about this book that I really should, by all
accounts, love.

	&nbsp;

	I never really considered myself in any way Canadian until I was 18 and
my mum, sister and I went to Quebec, Montreal and Toronto on holiday. I had
vague memories of family holidays in Toronto as a child and I did know that
my Dad had grown up there but other than that I was largely unaware. Yet in
that summer as we walked around the McGill campus where my Grandfather
studied, and ate smoked meat sandwiches in Ben’s, where my father used to go
for a treat as a small child, I felt a deep connection to the place. It felt
like the city was filling in the gaps in my personal history that my strained
relationship with my father and his side of the family had left.

	&nbsp;

	Over the last decade I have lived in Montreal twice and visited on
numerous other occasions. I have started and finished a Masters about
Québécois comic books and I am in the final year of a PhD about the same. If
Brenna is a Professional Canadian then I think I shall refer to myself as an
Apprentice Pseudo-Canadian from hereon in (Professional Pseudo Canadian in
Training is a bit too much of a mouthful).

	&nbsp;

	All this rather self indulgent rambling is to say that when I saw that
Brenna and Peter had discussed whether or not the European Graphixians* would
‘get’ Essex County I psssshawed very loudly indeed. I, Apprentice
Pseudo-Canadian would definitely ‘get’ this book. Cut me and I bleed Maple
Syrup. <em>I </em>could be none more Canadian without being born in Canada**.

	&nbsp;

	Reader, I hate to say it, but Brenna was possibly right***.

	&nbsp;

	The thing is though… I didn’t hate it, I just didn’t love it. Thinking
back on it, I feel like I enjoyed it a lot more than I felt I was as I read
it. Leafing through the book as I write this I keep on finding myself drawn
into reread pages. I also really did like the mini comics included at the
back of my edition, I enjoyed these glimpses of other Essex County stories
far more than I enjoyed those that took up the majority of the book.

	&nbsp;

	Objectively I can appreciate the book. I liked the way in which Lemire
incorporated Lester’s drawings and comics into the book. I loved the image of
Lou on page 242 spread across the map of the city. I enjoyed the broad
stories that were being told about these people, this place and their
relationships. However I never really connected with it. I didn’t care what
happened to them all, I wasn’t worried about Lester’s future, I wasn’t
concerned about Lou and Vince’s relationship.

	&nbsp;

	I think part of my issue with the book was that I couldn’t connect to the
two major themes presented within it as being almost synonymous with being
Canadian, the landscape and the hockey. In previous weeks Scott and Peter
have addressed these themes and how they are played out through the book. The
wide fields with their open skies that go on for miles and miles seemed alien
to me. I wasn’t touched by this depiction of landscapes familiar to me and so
whilst I appreciated Lemire’s drawings aesthetically I wasn’t drawn to them.
Meanwhile, whilst I am a fan of watching the odd Hockey game, I found myself
skimming past the detailed depictions of matches.

More Hockey?[/caption]

	&nbsp;

	In Peter’s post he remarks on Lemire’s drawing by saying that “His lines
look like they were drawn by a really talented person drawing with his wrong
hand”. After days of trying to sum up how I felt about Lemire’s artwork
Peter’s descripton made me do a little whop of recognition. It reminded me of
how I felt on a recent trip to see Neil Gaiman perform ‘The Truth is a Cave
in the Black Mountains’ live to projections of Eddie Campbell’s art. Some
images were beautiful, detailed paintings of characters that deftly conveyed
the nuance of their feelings at that moment in time.

	[caption id="attachment_3862" align="aligncenter" width="220"]<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/essex.gif"><img

alt="essex" width="220" height="300" /></a> I really liked this
page...[/caption]

	Others looked like scribbled sketches that Campbell had hastily coloured
and photoshopped. Similarly Lemire’s characters, particularly when he draws
them sat in quiet contemplation, have such depth of expression in their faces
that I could study them over and over again, yet frustratingly, there will
then follow pages of figures and drawings that are sketchy and served only to
distance me further from the narrative.

	&nbsp;

	I certainly don’t feel ready to write off Essex County as a book I didn’t
enjoy. However I do think there might have been something to the early
concerns that it might be slightly too Canadian for us to get. I don’t feel
that I got as much out of Essex County as I could have and one of the joys of
this series of posts has been reading what my fellow Graphixians have to say
about the book and finding things to appreciate that I had perhaps missed.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	* Those Graphixians who currently reside in Europe.

	** Even then, to be honest, you might struggle to own more kitschy,
vintage Canada themed crap than me.

	*** Honesty forces me to include this, though it may make Brenna giddy
with power.]]></content:encoded>

Erasure: The Soviet-era Komik  </title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Full confession: I
haven't done a lot of reading for this post; I'm going purely on instinct and
a desire to start the conversation not "weigh in" on it like some
well-informed zealot. The bottom line is that I couldn't find many comics
that covered what I wanted to address: Soviet-era komiksky. The materials are
scant, supposedly as a result of a cultural impetus away from the trapping of
Westernized ideology--I guess the Kremlin didn't really get that Superman was
basically a communist from outer-space. Even if I managed to find something,
getting my hands on it was next to impossible. The history of the Soviet-era
komik is an invisible or erased one, which of course seems now like an
entirely suitable topic.

	The politics of erasure in comics is often a popular subject. Erasure is
in fact what makes some comics so valuable--the disposability and pulp of
comics often causes examples to be erased from existence. When one example is
found, its value is determined by the number of other examples that don't
exist. But what if we were to direct our gaze to where comics are not? Could
we even conceive of what we are not looking for? It's never struck me more
that comics are Western in every politically, economically, and socially
loaded way. They tend to idealize the Western mindset that suggests freedom
from purgatory is the only option for one's existence, despite never really
addressing how the beached fish even knows the water is purgatory. At the
same time, comics utilize a mode of production that, at least until recently,
relies on the disposability of its tactile representation, and the repetition
of its narratives; a Westernized advertising strategy that echoes the Fordian
efficiency of the assembly-line if there ever was one: "you can have any
superhero you want, as long as its a Capitalist." In short, erasure is a
common thread the spins out of the button and to some extent releases comics
from accountability. As long as we don't look at comics long enough, or don't
have access to comics that reflect a different political, social, or economic
agenda, everything will be fine.

	Sometimes, there's a pre-determined perspective that governs the study of
comics. Because the "discipline" is nascent, sort of, we're allowed to get
away with all kinds of pretty myopic textual choices. For instance, one of
the reasons we're doing this sequence on "foreign" comics is to broaden our
view, but I for one was guilty of not really accounting for the mere
availability of comics outside the cultural mainframe (what? there's nothing
on comixology? What do I do now!?). Most often, comics scholarship has a real
need to establish its domain of interrogation, in structuralist terms, by
laying into the most voluminous material which, it so happens, is usually
North American and Japanese in origin. At best it's a delightful mix of
Anglo-American, White European, and Asian texts providing plenty of fodder
for the adventurous and canonical among us. At worst it discounts other
perspectives--political, economic, cultural--in favour of aggrandizing a set
of values that seem to be reinforced by the genre's own heroic values. In
short, we are what we read.

	All of which brings me to the communists. While abhorring everything to
do with the Bourgeois West, the Soviets put the kibosh on any comic book best
sellers in the republic. But one can't help but wonder what a comic book from
the Soviets would look like. The cold war truth is that we may never know
what that might have looked like. Even now, the archives prioritize
narratives such as Nikolai Maslov's "Siberia" that shows a desolate and bleak
worldview of the Russian state in which the main character wanders through a
Dantean Inferno of a Soviet system eventually going insane. Everything about
Maslov's book, the bleak storyline, the sketchy pencil drawing, the deeply
introspective bent, the historiographic gaze backward, belongs to the
structuralist triggers of the Western comics cannon for "arty"
autobiography--Spiegleman, Satrapi, Crumb, Bechdel, Barry (ugh); <a
href="http://www.empireonline.com/features/die-hard-movies-that-arent-die-
hard/p4" target="_blank"><em>Die Hard</em> with a pencil.</a>

	If I have a point, it's this: where's our gaze directed? And why? I'm not
suggesting that the persecuted individual without freedoms should not be
saved by the freedom-loving potential of a comicbook. Absolutely, I'm pro
comics that help those in shitty situations overcome those shitty situations,
however marginal that "help" might be. At the same time, if comics are as
universal as comics scholars often suggest that they are, then what are the
conditions of that universality. Taking a cue from the recent bent toward <a
href="https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF
-8#q=broken%20world%20thinking" target="_blank">"Broken World Thinking,"</a>
comics are not produced in an economic, political, or cultural vacuum, and we
do a pretty good job of talking about how comics under-represent women,
minorities, etc. But what about the comics we can't see? And, what about
those cultural, economic, and political situations that prohibit the very
existence of comics? What about that situation? How do we even understand
that situation? Can we, even? Should we, even? (This is all very Duchamp all
of a sudden... <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bride_Stripped_Bare_by_Her_Bachelors,
_Even" target="_blank">he liked it better broken.</a>)

	In the end, what exercises like this one tell me is that there's a whole
lotta stuff out there that's been erased; not "just" silenced. Restoring
erasure is way harder than restoring silences, and that's something comics
might need to grapple with -- that erasure is built into the political,
economic, and cultural apparatus of comics themselves.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I am well outside my
comfort zone this month, Graphixia friends, with the plan to write about
non-North American / non-Western European comics. I think of myself as a
fairly diverse reader, but I realized all my potential topics (comics and
indigenous experiences in New Zealand, the impact of WW2 on the Australian
comics industry, representations of the Middle East in comics) kept circling
back to be comparative studies of a world I was already familiar with, or
depended on readings of comics published in North America or Europe or
written by non-locals within the context and expectation of "Western" (I
know, yucky term) comics.

	One wants to challenge oneself. One doesn't want to be the dope writing
about <em>Jerusalem</em> for the international diversity month at Graphixia,
you know? (Which might have been my original plan.)

	The other problem is one of access. I found a dozen comics I really
wanted to read and potentially write about but couldn't secure a copy of;
comics like <a href="http://rebirthgraphicnovel.com">Rebirth: A Graphic
Novel</a> or <a href="http://www.magdycomics.com/index.html">Metro: A Story
of Cairo</a> that were not going to get to me in time to write this piece if
accessible in Canada at all. In so many ways, this ain't yet a global
village.

	I started to dabble in webcomics, especially as part of my search
for <em>Rebirth</em>, and I came upon the world of South African webcomics; I
read all of <a
href="http://www.uocomics.com/tomica/comic/tomica0000/">Tomica</a> and <a
href="http://cotton-star.com/archive/">Cottonstar</a>, which was a really
interesting process not least because I am used to a more self-contained
webcomic series. Both Tomica and Cottonstar are more like page-a-day
calendars for comics, and the lengthy arcs were an interesting counterpoint
to what I typically think of as webcomics.

	Webcomics, however, they were the ticket in, because they led me to <a
href="http://qaherathesuperhero.com">Qahera</a>. Hello, lover. This is a
webcomic created by an Egyptian woman about a hijab-wearing female superhero
who fights misogyny and white-lady feminism and is awesome and I will talk
about it in more detail in a second, BUT.

	I wanted to recount this story of my search for something to write about
this month because I think we need to talk more about how hard it is to find
these stories even when we go looking for them -- how even the most aware and
engaged comics consumer can look at their shelves and find a lot of white
people, a lot of dudes, a lot of Westerners (ew, icky word again). I'm glad
we did this topic, even if I flailed a lot, because it showed me that I
pretty much exclusively read North American / European comics. And now I can
work on doing something different.

	Starting with the bad-ass Qahera. You guys, I am in love.

	Qahera is a feminist superhero who sometimes fights the little battles

	Through the comic, creator Deena tackles a lot of difficult issues, and
her representations are perhaps not always perfect; one of the most
interesting aspects of the blog, however, is Deena's willingness to engage
with her readership. For example, one reader disagreed with Deena's
perspective on white-lady feminism and its myopic desire to see women in
hijab as oppressed and in need of rescue, and <a
href="http://kawrage.tumblr.com/post/55447662785/ive-been-asked-to-explain-my
-reservations-about">that blog response is now linked</a> as part of the FAQ
about the webcomic as a whole. Likewise, because the Qahera comic is hosted
on Tumblr, the "ask" box has become a site of active debate and discussion
about these overarching issues. For example, <a
href="http://blog.qaherathesuperhero.com/post/91426674184">in response to the
question of why Qahera isn't a super violent comic</a>, even when the threats
faced are dire: <blockquote><span style="color: #000000;">Lastly, the reason
I didn’t make Qahera a particularly violent and gory comic (trust me, i
really really wanted to. I have awesome blood spatter brushes I wanna work
with) is that Qahera is a Muslim woman. She’s not </span><em style="color:
#000000;">just</em><span style="color: #000000;"> a woman. If Qahera was
known for being a blood-thirsty superhero, it would be probably be cool for
about five seconds, but I can guarantee the backlash from it would be really
ugly (I already received criticism before because she was ‘holding a sword’
even though she didn’t use it.) Muslim women </span><em style="color:
#000000;">also</em><span style="color: #000000;"> have to face the
stereotypes all Muslims face: violent, bloodthirsty, angry, “jihadi.” That’s
not what I want Qahera to be, and it’s not what I want her to be known
for.</span></blockquote> It's thoughtful, it's engaged, it's open to
criticism, and it's the start of a dialogue. It's my platonic ideal of a
webcomic, and I had no idea it existed because I am an ignorant dork.

	So my take-away from this month at Graphixia is this: even if you think
you read a lot of different stuff, make an effort to do better. Maybe not the
highest critical heights I've ever reached, but probably a more important
lesson in the long run.]]></content:encoded>

Where’s Côte d’Ivoire Again? Abouet and Oubrerie’s Aya: Life in Yop

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[As this month’s
Graphixia topic has revealed, looking for comics outside the Western paradigm
isn’t something that even scholars of the medium do very often, or at least
not intentionally. When presented with the concept, we’re forced to meet it
as a challenge since our North Amerocentric market just doesn’t seem to have
room for them on our shelves – the main (and pretty much the only)
distributor of comics in the United States and Canada is Diamond
Distribution. This is the company that offers significant discounts and
exclusives to retailers, and they’re essentially a monopoly for comic shops.
If you’re a comics retailer, you in effect have to order wholesale directly
through Diamond, or if you’re a reader, you similarly have to order through a
secondary retail channel (like I do), being someone who resells from their
Diamond order. This means that if you’ve made it into the monthly Diamond
Previews, you’ve essentially made it and your books have a market. If not,
then you have no chance of commercial success in North America. Their
catalogue – even their backstock – is entirely English language and nearly
entirely Western, save for the increasing amount of Manga that has been
predominantly marketed by Viz and others to find its way to North American
shelves. And Manga has been so fully integrated that it nearly falls into
what we think of as being Western regardless (though I’m sure that comment
might not truck well with some). The web is of course changing this dynamic
quite a bit in terms of access to international digital comics, but it has
not yet impacted international print comics in the slightest.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ayacover.jpg"><img
class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4135"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ayacover-213x300.jpg"
alt="ayacover" width="213" height="300" /></a>All this to say that when
trying to find something from this outside my comfort zone, I actually began
feeling guilty that I had reached so little into countries that do not
“traditionally” produce comics, or at least countries that do not produce
them by means and in forms with which we are familiar. Thankfully I do have a
little experience with some of the non-Western comics that have come to me,
slightly embarrassingly, through winning Western awards. One of the most
internationally celebrated in recent memory is <em>Aya: Life in Yop
City</em>, written by Marguerite Abouet and richly illustrated by her husband
Clement Oubrerie, an anthology collecting the first several issues in a
series coming out of Côte d’Ivoire in Western Africa and which has reached
North America by means of being shortlisted for an Eisner and winning the
Best First Album award at Angouleme in Paris. Ostensibly a
pseudo-biographical story about the life of a young woman in the working
class village of Yopougon, the graphic novel is at first a challenging read
for a Western audience despite dealing with universal coming of age themes.
Though it has been translated and published in North America by Drawn and
Quarterly (a company which deserves loud and repeated thanks for the risks it
takes in allowing originally non-English texts to enter our market), many of
the idioms don’t quite work (ie “your mouth is as big as a cow’s behind”),
nor does the naming of “uncles” and “sisters” for strangers being approached
by those peddling wares or attempting to strike a bargain. The way the
characters interact seems stilted and unreal, not because of a poor
translation but because it employs slang all too realistically and, rightly,
in a way that unapologetic for a wider audience.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/setting1.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4137"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/setting1-240x300.jpg"
alt="setting1" width="240" height="300" /></a>Language use notwithstanding
(there’s a gloss in the back of the North American edition for difficult and
unfamiliar African slang), the content is difficult to navigate as well as it
is set in an intensely unfamiliar environment and deals with predominantly
unfamiliar moments which are, likely, meant to be casually and tacitly
understood by a local reader. A notable example comes when Aya’s close friend
Adjoua, caught in a love triangle in her attempts to wrangle the most
eligible bachelor in the village, thinks she has <em>palau</em>, being a
slang term for malaria when, in fact, it turns out she is actually just
pregnant. This is passed off as something so casual as to barely be noticed,
whereas the stigma that a Western reader brings to potentially contracting
malaria makes the scene highly unsettling – here, it’s the pregnancy that’s
meant to be emphasized, not the illness, and while we know that this is the
case, it’s difficult to shake the clearly incorrect response one has to the
scene. A similar interruption in our preset Western responses comes when Aya
is being harassed on the street by an aggressive male attempting to pick her
up, and she runs to protection by a more progressive couple who will stand up
for her rights as a woman. The defense is, however, disconcerting. The
protector asks of the pursuer, “you were about to hit a girl and you don’t
even know who her father is. Are you looking for trouble?” (53). One can read
this as a commentary on a woman’s place in the Ivory Coast being damned on
all sides, however this is again an entirely Western perspective grafted onto
the text that the surrounding context of the scene does not support – this
<em>is</em> the progressive attitude in the story, and it certainly comes
across that it’s meant to be perceived as such. The milieu is so inherently
different, clearly written for a very different audience with different
cultural baggage, that it’s problematic to interpret even the most basic of
signifiers. The graphic novel is rife with moments of rupture like this,
where a casual and highly social text challenges our engagement and reminds
us that while we are reading this culture, we are not of it.

	The reason that <em>Aya</em> (and other truly authentic texts like it) is
difficult to approach is because, very simply, it’s not in any way making any
attempt to be approachable. Despite the obvious pandering to a Western market
in later editions through appendices that include everything from Cote
d’Ivoire recopies infographics on how to wrap a baby, the original issues are
a rare portrayal of raw, suburban life in a country of which very few readers
know anything at all about. Very often we see in “exotic” texts a desire to
exemplify a culture or a setting, to explain to readers that yes, this is
what the Other looks like and yes, you need not be afraid. The graphic novels
that have famously reached the West about foreign environments, for example
the very frequently taught <em>Persepolis</em>, always appear to have this
self-conscious mission about them, consistently attempting to categorize and
tell a reader how to behave when reading in between the panels. <em>Aya</em>
doesn’t cast these kinds of aspersions, and in this, it’s truly what we could
identify as different: non-Western, with often radically unfamiliar cultural
mores tucked beneath the surface reading, unspoken because they’re intended
for an audience that carries all these with them already. In French, German,
Russian, even South American texts there’s always something of the Western,
and I’ve found a certain affinity and an entrypoint for shared cultural and
sociological understanding that has been necessary to underpin engagement.
The absence of this in <em>Aya</em> is, ironically, what makes texts from
places like the Ivory Coast so appealing in that one essentially has to
relearn the reading process and become comfortable with being confounded by a
lack of context and social awareness. Of course it does not intentionally
attempt to ostracize – quite the contrary, in that it was originally doing
its best to accommodate the local audience for whom the first issues were
intended. But the result remains the same: dipping into the comics of another
culture, comics originally not intended for export, is at once intriguing,
informative and ultimately unsettling in the best possible way.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Like Brenna in her post
for this series I think it is important to be open about our experiences of
trying to find comics to discuss from outside Europe, North America and
Japan. Because of the focus of my research and a close friend who lives
there, I initially decided that I would look at comics from New Caledonia…
And then I realized that looking at the French Diaspora wasn’t really pushing
me out of my reading comfort zone. I like to think that I read quite widely
and diversely, and for the last couple of years have made a conscious choice
to be better at doing so. However in preparing for this post I realized that
even when I do make efforts to read books (both comics and not) from a
diverse range of creators I don’t tend to look outside my North American and
European comfort zone and even more rarely do I write about them. So this is
me throwing down the gauntlet to myself and saying that I have to do better.
Not to let myself entirely off the hook I also struggled to find and get hold
of comics from countries outside Europe and North America. Partly this was an
issue of language and translation but even with the internet at my fingertips
I struggled to find somewhere to buy quite a number of comics I found.

	&nbsp;

	I’ve chosen to head to Brazil this time round, partly because I found
this book and fell in love with the artwork. André Diniz’s <em>Picture a
Favela</em> is his effort to create a comic book biography of his friend
Maurício Hora a well-known Brazilian photographer. While Diniz’s name was new
to me it turns out that he is exceedingly successful in his own country and
has been awarded the highest accolade available in Brazilian comics on no
fewer than three occasions. This book, his most recent, was translated into
French and English and published in the UK by Self Made Hero in 2012. The
book tells the story of Hora’s childhood in the original favela, Providencia
Hill, located behind the train station in Rio de Janeiro. Hora grew up in the
favela as the son of a gangster, a man who bears more than a passing
resemblance to Don Corleone and fulfills a similar role within his local
community, at least in terms of caring for his neighbours and resolving
difficult situations. In this history roles are reversed and it is the police
that the residents of Providencia Hill need to be scared of not the local
gangsters.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screenshot-2015-02-
24-21.09.26.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4144 size-medium"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screenshot-2015-02-24
-21.09.26-300x215.png" alt="Andre Diniz - Picture a Favela" width="300"
height="215" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	The story is told through the voice of Hora, and we see his journey from
a young child confused about his gangster father to a photography obsessed
adolescent. The artwork is almost exclusively in black and white (all but the
final panel) and is reminiscent of linocuts. The irregular edges and stark
colour palette make these images as spiky and uncomfortable to read as the
society they depict. The images initially appear simple and this reinforces
the idea that these are memories told from the perspective of a child.
However as the story progresses and Hora reveals his fractured relationship
with his father and the progression of his mother’s schizophrenia, the sharp
jagged lines of his art seem the ideal way in which to reflect these
difficult aspects of his life.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screenshot-2015-02-
24-21.42.06.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4147 size-full"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screenshot-2015-02-24
-21.42.06.png" alt="Andre Diniz - Picture a Favela" width="290" height="249"
/></a>

	Hora’s narration confides to the reader, and indeed repeatedly shows,
that although he was born there and grew up in the area, he is still unable
to take photos in every part of the favela. Thus this book serves a dual
purpose, it not only tells Hora’s fascinating story but also allows the
reader to see a version of areas that even Hora cannot photograph easily. By
drawing in a style that is so physically different from Hora’s photographs,
Diniz doesn’t try to recreate the vision of the favela that Horsa presents
through his photography but instead offers a version of the area that
attempts to in some ways communicate Hora’s childhood experiences of the
space. Jagged, menacing and yet simple and two-dimensional, Diniz’s evocation
of Hora’s life and art is compelling.

	&nbsp;

	<a

24-21.03.55.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4143 size-medium"

height="251" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Picking a book published by a significant UK publisher might not have
been the most adventurous foray into comics from outside Europe, America and
Japan but it is certainly a choice I am glad I made. I'm going to start by
looking for more books by Diniz that I can read and then see what else I can
find.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[You wait years for an
event with an Indian cartoonist in Dundee and then two come along within a
fortnight. At the end of June last year <a href="http://www.scottishpen.org/"
target="_blank">Scottish PEN</a> and <a
href="http://www.dundee.ac.uk/literarydundee/" target="_blank">Literary
Dundee</a> hosted an event sponsored by the then ubiquitous Commonwealth

target="_blank">Karrie Fransman</a> from the UK and <a

This was the first time I had encountered Patil’s comics, and I was
captivated by her work. Her first book <a
href="https://amrutapatil.wordpress.com/graphic-novels/"
target="_blank"><i>Kari</i></a> (2008) is the story of “a young, deeply
introverted, asocial and queer woman, a counterpoint to the hyperfeminine
prototypes you keep coming across.” The book concerns lost love, survival and
friendship, and is beautifully drawn in black ink with pencil shading but
with frequent bursts of colour. Her latest book <i><a
href="https://amrutapatil.wordpress.com/adi-parva-2/" target="_blank">Adi
Parva - Churning of the Ocean</a> </i>(2012) is the first in her two volume
adaptation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata"
target="_blank"><i>Mahabharat</i></a>, one of the major epics of ancient
India. If I'd had enough money I would have bought both books on the spot but
I decided to go for <em>Kari</em> (start at the beginning of a career!).
Patil took the time to chat to the people buying her books and graciously
drew dedications in them all. It was a joy to watch her sketch on my copy.

	The Mahabharat has been adapted countless times over the centuries in
various media including a 42 volume comics series from <a
href="http://www.ack-media.com/AmarChitraKatha.aspx" target="_blank">Amit
Chitra Katha</a> (ACK). Founded in 1967 by <a
href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/07/anant-pai-obituary"
target="_blank">Anant Pai</a>, ACK was for a long time pretty much the entire
Indian comics industry and they have released over 440 issues. Having
published English language comics featuring American heroes such as <a
href="http://www.comicvine.com/indrajal-comics/4050-40270/"
target="_blank"><i>The Phantom</i></a><i>,</i> Pai realised that there was a
desire for comics featuring Indian characters and stories. They moved from
publishing European stories such as <i>Cinderella</i> in Hindi to Indian
stories such as <a
href="http://www.amarchitrakatha.com/us/amar-chitra-katha/epics-mythology/
krishna" target="_blank"><i>Krishna</i></a> in English (to appeal to a middle
class readership). During the 1970s the original art from the stories in ACK
was relettered to make issues available in Hindi and various other regional
languages including Bengali, Malayalam, Kannada, and Assamese. By the end of
the decade ACK had become the best-selling comic book series in India (McLain
2009).

	While I enjoy fictional stories based in myth as much as the next reader,
what I truly love are stories told by ordinary people about their own lives
created in their own words and pictures. A few weeks before the Patil and
Fransman talk I received an email from the education officer at <a
href="http://www.dca.org.uk/" target="_blank">Dundee Contemporary Arts</a>
(my office is in their building and I have occasionally hosted comics making
workshops for them). It explained that a comics artist from India was hosting
a workshop for the local authority and wondered if I would like to take part.
I was intrigued and said I would be delighted to attend. The workshop was
hosted by <a href="https://www.ashoka.org/fellow/sharad-sharma"
target="_blank">Sharad Sharma</a> of the <a
href="http://www.worldcomicsindia.com/" target="_blank">World Comics
Network</a>.

	Sharma is a cartoonist based in New Delhi, India. He was associated with
several newspapers and magazines as a journalist and editorial cartoonist
before he switched to electronic media and introduced political animation to
Indian TV news channels. A committed comics activist, Sharma founded the
World Comics Network (WCN) as a way of empowering people to tell their own
stories and to raise issues important to them. The WCN slogan <i>Comics
Power!</i> is no accident and they teach workshops to hand that power to
people all over the world. He set up World Comics to promote issues based
“Grassroots Comics” - short stories produced on easily reproducible
photocopier paper made by the people directly affected by the issues.
According to their website the network is active in India, Pakistan, Sri
Lanka, Nepal, Brazil, Thailand, Palestine, Estonia, Finland, UK, Tanzania,
Mozambique, Benin and Mongolia. <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"
lang="en">ABCD of Grassroots Comics is <a
href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Anybodycandraw?src=hash">#Anybodycandraw</a
> <a href="http://t.co/KMqllmNtC5">pic.twitter.com/KMqllmNtC5</a>

	— World Comics Network (@WorldComicsNet) <a
href="https://twitter.com/WorldComicsNet/status/488647069163597824">July 14,
2014</a></blockquote> <script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"
async="" charset="utf-8"></script>

	Sharma explained his methodology for encouraging people to draw their own
stories, what he called the ABCD of comics. If anyone has been in earshot of
me over the last few months (including at the ‘zines’ discussion at the <a
href="http://www.comicsunconference.co.uk/" target="_blank">Scottish Comics
Unconference Meet-up</a> last weekend) you will have heard me excitedly
explaining this idea. It is this simple - Any Body Can Draw. Really. That’s
it. This effortless philosophy lies at the heart of everything WCN do, and it
helps to empower people to tell their stories. As the WCN website says most
of the time these Grassroots Comics are “linked to some organisation activity
or the social campaign. The comics are photocopied and distributed to a
limited area, which encourage local debate in the society. They are
inexpensive and the method is not complicated, you just require a pen, paper
and access to a copying machine to produce one.” WCN also promotes the idea
of stripping down a story to four panels to tell it succinctly and clearly as
possible. These four panel strips can then be used like posters around the
towns and villages.

	There are many parallels with the fanzine boom of the 1970s which
coincided with punk and a “do-it-yourself” philosophy. Fanzines existed at
least as early as the 1930s but the access to cheap reproduction helped cause
an explosion of self expression in the 1970s. Like these zines the creators
of Grassroots Comics own the content, unlike them the distribution isn’t
limited to being handed out at gigs or by mail order. The comics are pasted
up in all possible locations such as the “village’s meeting place, bus stops,
shops, offices, schools, on notice-boards and electricity poles or even on
trees.” It is almost impossible to not see these short comics and the message
they promote.

	It seems slightly odd to have discussed both Sharma and Patil's work in
this post during Graphixia's series on comics from countries other than
Europe, North America and Japan (snappy title) as they have very little in
common apart from the country they were born in, and that is such an
arbitrary notion to base a post on. But I did discover their work within two
weeks of each other, and both of their comics are a testament to the
different powers of comics. The myth based richly textured stories of Patil
that work so well in comics, and the short straight forward four-panel strips
of real life that Sharma and the World Comics Network help bring to public
attention. Like graphic novels and newspaper strips, they are very different
but still contain the power of comics.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Like the majority of
the Graphixians have done this series, I feel I ought to open with a
disclaimer about my comfort zone being firmly within Anglo-American comics,
and to offer my assurance that I’m working hard to change this. In fact,
through the other posts in this series and through last week’s <a
href="http://www.comicsunconference.co.uk/" target="blank">Scottish Comics
Unconference</a>, I have been discovering cartoonists from Brazil and India,
among other countries, who have absolutely floored me, and I continue to do
so every day. I had intended to write about Sharad Sharma and his wonderfully
inclusive <a
href="https://twitter.com/worldcomicsnet/status/488647069163597824"
target="blank">ABCD</a> (Any Body Can Draw) mantra, as it was a big hit with
me and others at the Unconference, but Damon got there first. However, in
researching comics and performance to prepare for my first <a
href="http://www.damonherd.com/deecap/" target="blank">DeeCAP</a> appearance
last weekend, I chanced upon a comics performance by one of Australia’s most
prominent alternative cartoonists on YouTube, and was really struck by it.
And as nobody has really talked about Australian comics in this series –
apart from Brenna, in passing – I thought this comic would be the perfect
subject for some reflections on comics and performance, with a global spin
for the series.

	The comic in question is <em><a
href="http://www.patgrantart.com/toominavideo/toorminavideo.html"
target="blank">Toormina Video</a>,</em> an autobiographical story by
Australian cartoonist <a href="http://www.patgrantart.com" target="blank">Pat
Grant</a>. I can’t be certain, but I think it’s the first Australian comic I
read, after somebody posted a link to it on Twitter last year. It’s bleak and
hopeful in equal measure, poignant but still funny, with a couple of panels
that stopped me dead with their encapsulation of the persistence of death and
decay. Grant’s art style, with small, oval eyes and heavy brushstrokes, bears
more than a passing resemblance to James Kochalka’s <em>American Elf</em>,
but is unique in its application of colours and its limited palette, which
works hard in <em>Toormina Video</em> to deliver a shady, hazy portrait of
Grant’s Australian childhood, seen as if through a series of photographs in
sepia. Grant’s father is portrayed as an alcoholic who leaves his young son
in the car while he drinks, and later suffers serious psychological problems
as an old man, until he eventually dies. And yet, as he is in Grant’s comic,
drawn in Grant’s soft, upbeat and thick-stroked style, I can’t help but warm
to him.

	[caption id="attachment_4193" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/toormina1.png"><img

alt="Toormina Video by Pat Grant" width="500" height="692" /></a> Toormina
Video[/caption]

	Reading <em>Toormina Video</em> online is an evocative experience, and
one that has certainly stayed with me as an exemplary narrative about growing
up in rural Australia, as well as my most prominent experience of reading
Australian autobiographical comics. I’ve since read many others, mostly
through recommendations in <a href="http://australiancomicsjournal.com/"
target="blank">The Australian Comics Journal</a> and the weekly free offering
from the excellent <a href="http://caravanofcomics.com/giveaway/"
target="blank">Caravan of Comics</a>, which introduces a new Australian
cartoonist each week. I highly recommend getting stuck into both of those.
From my limited experience there, it seems the culture of Australian comics
is vibrant and engaging, and often deals with the concerns of the disparate
landscape of such a large continent, as I somewhat expected. Toormina Video,
however, still remains the most prominent example, to me, of Australianness,
as performed in the art form of autobiographical comics. For me, Grant’s
father came to embody Australia itself, a father whose parenting provided a
barren and harsh landscape, but one shot through with warmth and comfort –
the only video store for miles around.

	So it’s a great comic when read. When performed, however, I found the
emotiveness of the narrative doubled – and I didn’t even see it live, <a
title="Toormina Video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4eXTigOQSU"
target="_blank">I just watched it on YouTube</a>. The video is taken from a
live perfomance Grant gave for <a href="http://radiowithpictures.com.au/"
target="blank">Radio With Pictures</a>, an Australian collective momvement
for comics performance similar to Scotland’s DeeCAP. What is notable about
the video is that the comic has been adapted for the performance, with all
the textual narrative removed, leaving only the images. All the text is
narrated by Grant himself, allowing him to control the flow of the comic much
more closely than would be possible with a traditional reading experience,
but also – and most significantly – allowing him to bring an extra dimension
to the narrative of his comic, through his reading voice and his Australian
accent.

	[caption id="attachment_4198" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/toormina16.png"><img
class="size-full wp-image-4198"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/toormina16.png"
alt="Toormina Video, by Pat Grant" width="500" height="715" /></a> Toormina
Video[/caption]

	Just as Damon’s Scottish accent provides another layer of narrative when
incorporated into <a href="https://vimeo.com/121492892" target="blank">his
DeeCAP performances</a>, so does Pat Grant’s Australian accent provide an
explicit marker of Australianness, making his performance of <em>Toormina
Video</em> doubly Australian and thus doubly unique, but also doubly
representative of its creation outside of the Anglo-American paradigm that
dominates the global art form of comics.

	As such, and as a newly incensed advocate of performing comics, I’d like
to see more comics being performed from all over the world, as there is a
clear opportunity to bring an extra narrative dimension that opens comics to
non Anglo-American (and Franco-Belgian and Japanese) creators and audiences.
Especially with YouTube as a growing global platform, we may eventually find
that our exposure to comics from outside our Western paradigms eventually
happens as much through performances as through traditional reading, if the
effectiveness of Pat Grant’s performance of <em>Toormina Video</em> is
anything to go by.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>As the previous
posts have clearly demonstrated, this series on comics outside of
North-America, Europe, and Japan clearly helps explore new horizons, discover
other ways of making comics, and find new, different voices that showcase the
diversity of comics. This series also reveals some of comics studies’ biases
and its focus on major traditions. The important question of access has
rightfully come up several times: many of the previous posts are as much
about the comic in question as about the writer's encounter with that
particular comic. </em><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2015/02/03/194-erasure-the-soviet-era-
komik/">Dave's post</a><em> clearly pushes towards the deepest stakes of the
access issue by reflecting on erasure, asking “what about the comics we can’t
see?”</em>

	<em>            For my post, I immediately thought of writing on Israeli
comics because of their visibility at the time of </em><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2015/01/19/193-manhwa-splaining-korean-
comics-and-allegories-of-mastery/">Peter's first post</a><em>.</em><em>
Indeed, last January, Gilad Selitkar, Asaf and Tomer Hanuka were touring
Europe, with prominent conferences, signing sessions and conversations in
Paris, Angoulême and Brussels, bringing  significant attention to what was
termed the “</em><a
href="http://www.actuabd.com/+Rencontre-avec-la-Nouvelle-bande+">nouvelle
bande dessinée israélienne</a><em>” ('new Israeli comics')</em>.<em> The term
refers in fact to the “</em>nouvelle bande dessinée française<em>,” which
designated the bestselling success of authors as Trondheim, Sfar, and Blain
beyond the alternative sphere. I was interested in how these Israeli comics
were fit into a pre-existent French model, which made me wonder about the
place of this so-called 'new Israeli comics' in Israel. I feared I would not
learn much more about Israeli comics only by reading what French-speaking
people say they are. This is why I asked <strong>Assaf Gamzou</strong>, who
is curator at the </em>Israeli Cartoon Museum<em>, if he wanted to
collaborate on this post in order to gain from his insights into the
subject.</em>

	<em> </em>

	<strong>Benoît </strong>– Maybe these artists – Rutu Modan, Gilad
Selitkar, Asaf and Tomer Hanuka – could get us started. I know big American
and European publishers directly publish many of them, and the Hanuka
brothers have been trained respectively in New York and Lyon. To some extent,
they do not really seem to stand out from the big comics tradition, but to
have integrated with it. This, of course, is a regular pattern: cartoonists
coming from the 'periphery' need to reach the 'center' in order to gain
visibility for their works. How do you think about this hierarchical dynamic
with relation to Israeli comics? Are they really the 'periphery'? And how
representative is this 'Israeli canon'?

	<strong> </strong>

	<strong>Assaf </strong>– Well, I think you make an excellent point about
the influences on these artists. When I look at them, I don’t just see this
generation, but 80 past years of making comics in Israel. When looking at it
from that angle, several other points come to mind.

	This is the point where I guess I should tell you and the readers a bit
about the History of Israeli Comics: Israeli comics can be roughly separated
into three “waves” or “generations.” The first – from 1935 to 1975, is
characterized by the view of the medium as infantile, and its main mode of
production is the newspaper strip for kids. Also, most (but not all) of these
strips were genre plots 'borrowed,' in both style and content, from America
and nationalized to tell an "Israeli" story. For example: <em>The Knights of
The Wailing Wall </em>(1974), drawn by Dov Zigelman and written by Giora
Rotman: an historical comic strip that tells the adventures of a Jewish boy
during the crusades. After saving the crusade leader, the boy is knighted and
given the title of 'protector of the wall', a title which he keeps until the
six day war, when Jewish soldiers once again conquer the wall. Therefore,
speaking in very broad terms, there was not much original work or style done
at the time (this isn't absolutely accurate of course, as there were some
wonderful artists and writers working at the time).

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Israeli-001.png"><

src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Israeli-001.png"
alt="Israeli 001" width="305" height="423" /></a>

	The second wave starts after The Yom Kippur war (1973) and the crisis
that followed that war. This generation of cartoonists rejected the notions
of nation building and child-oriented work. Instead, they created work that
was sometimes subversive, many times oriented towards teens or mature
audiences, and stylistically unique. The 'godfather' of this generation is
Dudu Geva with <em>Me Gochach (Ridiculous) behind enemy lines </em>(1985).

	In this image – a spoof on the Israeli soldier hero genre. Geva was one
of the leaders among cartoonists and cultural figures in the deconstruction
of prevalent Israeli myths and cultural beliefs during the 1980s. While Geva
was very aware of his artistic origins and influences, and the history of the
medium, he strove to create a unique "Israeli" style. This style was
minimalistic, rash and full of visual "Chutzpa". Other notable artists and
works include Itzik Rennert with <em>Herzl visits Israel </em>(1990).

	In this strip, Rennert uses the style of his predecessors – the adventure
strip (used by them to depict soldiers and heroes), to poke fun at modern day
Israel and the founder of Zionism – Theodor Herzl.

alt="Israeli 003" width="271" height="166" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	Another example is <em>Uri Zohar </em>(1988)by Michel Kichka. Uri Zohar
was a famous bohemian and film maker, who later in his life turned to
religion and became a Hassidic Rabbi. Kichka, a Belgian born Israeli
cartoonist, shows his amazement at Zohar's announcement, made late at night
during his radio show.

	&nbsp;

	This generation was in a very real sense the anti-thesis of their
predecessors: rallying against power structures and taboos, wishing to have
their own style. The mid 90's brought along their students, who were begging
to graduate from the Art academies. These students, like Gilad Seliktar, Rutu
Modan, Asaf and Tomer Hanuka, wished to create their own style like their
teachers, except for two major differences: they were more willing to
incorporate the influences of American and French comics, and also actively
pursued publication in those countries. Thematically speaking, they many
times deal with personal, even autobiographical stories, that reflect a much
larger political and social condition. So, from my perspective this looks
like a perfect Hegelian cycle: thesis, anti-thesis, synthesis. From your
point of view, it is the periphery assimilating into the mainstream.

	&nbsp;

	<strong>Benoît </strong>– Thanks for this crash course in the history of
Israeli comics! This is precisely what is at stake when we look at comics in
a global perspective and at these cultural exchanges: these cartoonists are
integrated into the “target” traditions at the cost of the historical
perspective, where they come from, what feeds into them. Now, when I said
that Modan, Selitkar and Hanuka brothers were 'assimilating' into the
North-American and Franco-Belgian mainstream, I didn't mean that they
consciously tried to integrate them by all cost, and overall, I think it is
rather that they produce original work that makes part of a recent, general
internationalization of comics production. So, this dichotomy of 'center' and
'periphery' has broken down to some extent. However, when Francophone media
portray these artists as the 'new Israeli comics' based on their own
indigenous models, it does not seem to do them justice, obscuring the larger
tradition – where, as you pointed out, Israeli cartoonists seem to have been
intensely aware of this history all along. Now, the three waves you sketched,
to some extent, follow a relatively similar course as in the US and in Europe
(though in different ways, of course!). What, to me, seems to stand out from
your overview, is this relationship to conflict and militarism, the Israeli
soldier hero genre, which is very much tied in with the historical and
political context. This is something that also characterized Selitkar, Modan,
and the Hanuka brothers. For instance, <em>The Divine </em>(2015),by Tomer
and Asaf Hanuka with Boaz Lavie, is a fictional tale, inspired by a press
photograph of a child soldier in South-East Asia. It relies on a powerful
Asian-inspired imagery worked into  an idiosyncratic style that is otherwise
influenced by American comic books.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Israeli-004.png"><
img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4211"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Israeli-004.png"
alt="Israeli 004" width="260" height="423" /></a>

	In contrast with Selitkar and Modan's stories, it's much less directly
grounded in the socio-political context of today's Israel, but nonetheless
broaches questions of conflict. So, how would you frame the social and
political implications of these artists? And, more generally, what is the
political position and role of comics and cartoons in Israel?

	&nbsp;

	<strong>Assaf</strong> – Well, I think you're spot-on in your analysis of
the works you mentioned. As you said, while the Hanuka brothers don’t deal
directly with the Israeli political reality, their ability to pick and choose
stylistic elements from different graphic traditions and their choice of
conflict as subject matter are very emblematic of Israeli cartooning in
general.

	&nbsp;

	Generally speaking, I think we are witnessing a constant rise in the
discursive space allotted to the medium in Israeli society. At first the
medium was marginalised in its production and target audience, and subjected
to the national ethos. Now works' like Modan's <em>The Property</em> and
Michel Kichka's <em>The second Generation</em> are works that are read,
debated, discussed and taught by the public in general, and not just
art-school graduates and "comic nerds".

	&nbsp;

	However, it is worth noting that both of the works mentioned here deal
with the memory of the Holocaust – a major discursive force by itself. Works
that deal with the army (like Seliktar's <em>Tsav 8</em>), a more
controversial issue, might have a harder time getting recognition. This means
that it is still an effort to publish a graphic novel in Israel – but we're
definitely getting there, as far as acceptability is
concerned.]]></content:encoded>

	<em> 1874 </em>is a science fiction/speculative fiction prose novella by
Mexican author Bernardo Fernández "<a
title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardo_Fern%C3%A1ndez"
href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardo_Fern%C3%A1ndez"
target="_blank">Bef"</a>. The book was published electronically in <a
title="Amazon link "
href="http://www.amazon.com/1874-Spanish-Edition-Bernardo-Fern%C3%A1ndez-
ebook/dp/B00E688GA8" target="_blank">2013</a>, and the same year he worked
adapting his text into comics/<a

1874"
href="http://www.editorialresistencia.com.mx/catalogo/cuento-y-novela/171-
1874" target="_blank">graphic novella form</a> with artist Jorge F. Muñoz "<a
title="http://yorko.daportfolio.com/" href="http://yorko.daportfolio.com/"
target="_blank">Yorko"</a>. Both authors are from Mexico City, also known as
"D.F.", whose metropolitan area is said to reach 21.2 million people (<a
title="http://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/mexico-city-population/"
href="http://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/mexico-city-population/"
target="_blank">World Population Review</a>). Why this matters may or may not
become clearer later on. The result is a kind of Mexican steampunk noir
thriller that addresses issues of genre and politics as pinpointed by
information technology.

	It is interesting that though Bef is also a comics artist,  in this case
he worked with another artist and limited his participation to the adaptation
of the text. The result is two distinctively different books/texts/artifacts.
Here I won't dwell on the differences between the original and its
adaptation. My main point in this short post, however, is suggesting
that <em>1874 </em>the graphic novella, though clearly inserted within the
science fiction genre/tradition, represents an example of how Mexican comics
are expressing the local through the global. The "local" in this case means a
particularly Mexican vision of the national state of affairs; the "global"
the globalized discourse of science fiction (and genre variants) and "the
graphic novel".

	The story is set in a floating city/world inhabited by
automata/robots/self-operating humanoid machines. The consequences of a war
are suggested. The protagonist is Sr. Inspector, a detective whose stream of
consciousness we have access to and which directs the narrative. He receives
a message that there has been a murder at the Central Library: the (only)
librarian has been apparently murdered. Or did he/she/it killed
him/her/itself? Can automata/robots kill themselves? And if not, who would
have wanted the librarian dead, and how can the mystery be solved?

	What lies at the core of <em>1874</em> is the interconnections/wirings
that plug everything together. The heart of the matter is, indeed,
information: what we know and what we do not know, what are lies and what are
secrets, the format in which information and memories can be preserved and
shared, and what happens when the platforms/methods for communicating
memory/history are destroyed, or tampered with.

	<em>1874 </em>is also very obviously a homage to an ever-increasing pile
of well-known influences: Asimov, Chandler, Hammett, Bradbury, C. Clarke,
Lucas, even Frank Miller. The panel layouts are designed to convey the
frustratingly slow-yet-frantic pace of the urban commute in a big, dangerous,
impersonal and polluted metropolis, whilst evoking panel by panel the
melancholy introspection of the hard-boiled, tough-but-romantic detective.

	Bef's and Yorko's visual storytelling supports itself on regular panel
layouts on the page that mirror each other when two pages are viewed
simultaneously. The cinematic pace is supported by changes in point of
view/perspective that alternate rhythmically following the flow of the
dialogue between characters (this/that/here/there/left/right/left/right).
This flow is successfully punctuated by the clever use of a ping-pong of
short sentences in the dialogue between characters that fluent Latin American
Spanish readers will recognize as overtly formal and therefore bureaucratic
and artificially forced.

Pages 13-14[/caption]

	The panels above show the detective coming out of the crime scene while
members of the media await his words. The detective remains quiet; the police
commissioner tells the journalists to wait for the "official communication".
This moment is crucial to the narrative/aesthetic strategy of the book, where
the awareness of the exposed machinery of the system contrasts with the
opacity of the information available. What is it being said in what we see?
What does it all mean? The reader needs to become the detective and, blocked
from the truth, like a citizen, do her own research for the truth. Who wanted
the librarian dead and why? Who can we ask?

	The aesthetic 'feel' of the novella is dialogic, as panels and pages and
characters talk to each other back and forth. Narrative captions are only
used to refer to the protagonist's inner thoughts or to written messages sent
through machines. The general melancholy feel of the novella though is
achieved not through dialogue, but through the 'silent' wordless panel
sequences, which promptly nudge the reader to realize onomatopoeias are not
used throughout, and what one would have imagined to be a very noisy world,
full of the sound of engines and machinery, is indeed silent, like an
expressionist movie (<em>Metropolis</em>?) that has suddenly achieved the
magic of colour.

	[caption id="attachment_4223" align="aligncenter" width="619"]<img

Pages 39-40[/caption]

	And it is through colour that <em>1874</em> inserts itself in a tradition
of Mexican visual storytelling that I would dare to trace back to the Mexican
muralists. Myers noted Diego Rivera's "increasing preoccupation with industry
and the machine", but it is what Myers calls "Siqueiros's tremendous interest
in achieving a certain dynamics of movement" that I see inherited in Yorko's
parallel mechanized city.

	Yorko's palette goes for the colours of rust, violence, pollution,
concrete and sadness: reds, ocher, greens, browns, the yellow of paper and
dim sunlight, the highly-contrasted black of <em>noir.</em> Above all, the
trace shows the tension between the softness of the ink and the colour and
the hardness of metal, evoking the tensions between the automata and human
will. Consider Siqueiros' palette here, the flow of the curvaceous, fluid
lines, evoking roots, branches, streams and flames:

	[caption id="attachment_4233" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/siqueiros.jpg"><img

City[/caption]

	I see a similar drive, an impulse if you will, in Yorko's inclined, bent
figures, an angular perspective drawn to the corners of the panel, and,
again, the curvaceous, fluid trace of the smoke after the fire:

	[caption id="attachment_4234" align="aligncenter" width="486"]<a

	Or maybe look at the circular motifs in Yorko's robotic characters (more
than one robot in the story is a cyclops with a Big-Brotheresque eye) and
compare with Siqueiros' attempt at making sense of the texture of
technological flesh:

	Perhaps the reader won't see the echoes I see between the work of the
Mexican comic book artist and the work of the great Mexican muralist.
Non-Mexican readers expecting to find elements of folklore will be
disappointed. The "local" in this comic is not expressed as cliché, but as
the places in common between science fiction, speculative fiction and
historical political drama. This is a Mexican novella at its core not only
because its authors are Mexican, but also because it presents, in genre and
highly-aestheticised form, a [perhaps unconscious, or unintentional]
commentary on contemporary Mexico.

	What I read in Bef and Yorko's novella is a meditation on the nature of
technology as a means to record history and to remember it. The reader will
expect the crime to be solved. Bef and Yorko's fictional city is not Mexico
City, but it could be. It floats on the air, pulled by a flying robotic whale
covered in rubber skin. Nothing is what it seems, or what we thought it was.
The consequences of the war can be felt, but not everyone is willing to see
the truth, and those who know it have closed the case. The detectives are
lonely, and the librarians are dying. In spite of all the questions posed by
the book what remains, for me as a reader, is Mexico: what is it that remains
silent, muted in this story? <em> </em>

	<em>1874 </em>is also about what is unknown, and therefore it is also
about a serious philosophical problem. Asking if androids dream of electric
sheep, Bef and Yorko seem to tell us, is a question about hope, whether there
can be hope in a world where access to information is blocked and where
crimes remain unsolved. What is hope if not the awareness that there was a
past and there could be a future? What if we discover all was lost? These
questions are of course not new, but the possible suicide of the librarian
poses the question of what it means to be human in a world where machines
reign. If "electric things have their life too", as Arthur C. Clarke wrote,
would they wish to end it when hope is lost? When would an "electric thing"
decide to reject life?

	In <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory"
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory" target="_blank">automata
theory</a>, Wikipedia tells me today, "an automaton is a mathematical object
that takes a word as input and decides either to accept it or reject it."
What happens when we reject the word that has been given to us? Is this what
the librarian did? Is there a metaphor in there somewhere, pristine clear, or
am I as paranoid as a robot being chased by all-seeing machines? All this is,
of course, merely but the beginning of the question. We'll need a librarian
to help us out.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[By chance, I happened
to come across Fumio Obata’s <i>Just So Happens</i> and Etienne Davodeau’s
<i>Lulu Anew</i> (translated from the French) at the same time. Each of these
books presents a liminal narrative about passing into a new world or state of
being within the parameters of realism. That is, they do what many science
fiction and fantasy comics do but in a subtler way. But, be not mistaken,
each of these comics is about their female heroine’s radical transformation
through exploring another world. These comics are also linked in that the
artists are men depicting the struggle of women against their gendered
familial constraints that potentially corrupt their freedom and
self-determination. Each presents a character making a shift from one world
of experience to another and back again that makes the uncanny or
<i>unheimlich</i> the dominant experience.

	In <i>Just So Happens</i> Yumiko must return to Japan from London on the
death of her father. There she confronts just how un-Japanese she has become:
she is like a foreign guest at her own father's funeral, unable to fathom the
customs and traditions. Rather, she sees through those customs and traditions
in a way that her family members who have not been away from Japan cannot. At
the same time, though, she sees that Japan is her roots. The death of
Yumiko’s father is the death of Japan’s hold on her, a release so that she
can marry her white, English boyfriend Mark and carry on her life in London.
When she goes to Japan, she consciously leaves Mark behind.

	Yumiko is a successful woman in London where she runs a thriving design
company. She is in love with London's multicultural phantasmagoria that
presents a contrast to Japanese cultural homogeneity. In the brief segments
at the beginning and conclusion of the book in London, Obata overtly draws a
diversity of cultural and ethnic types. This is very much a “London” vs Japan
book rather than an “England” vs Japan book.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screenshot-2015-04-
29-09.25.49.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4282 size-full"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screenshot-2015-04-29
-09.25.49.png" alt="" width="580" height="556" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	When she is on the plane back to Japan, Yumiko reflects on her last
visit, particularly on her exchanges with her father. Obata is particularly
adept at interspersing flashbacks, dreams, and daydreams into the comic,
using visual cues to indicate the relationship between what we are seeing and
present reality.

	As father and daughter watch a fireworks display, we learn that Yumiko’s
parents are divorced and don’t talk to each other. Furthermore, her father
doesn’t think she can continue in England; he wants her to come back to Japan
and get married. He knows someone who might be a good match. Yumiko’s father
had old-fashioned gender attitudes. He doesn’t think  spending  money on a
design career for a girl makes sense.

	To escape this conversation, Yumiko ducks into a Shinto shrine where a
rehearsal for a Noh play underway. Noh theatre becomes a metaphor for
traditional Japan in <i>Just So Happens</i>. It is both an antidote for and
explanation of the empty rituals of her father’s funeral, for instance, as
the Noh actors keep invading her imagination during her trip to her father’s
funeral.

	We see these imagined figures integrated with Yumiko's reality in another
example of Obata working seamlessly with visual registers.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screenshot-2015-04-
28-10.26.00.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4272 size-full"

-10.26.00.png" alt="" width="980" height="792" /></a>

	The emotional and aesthetic austerity of Noh contrasts with the emptiness
of funeral rituals like the kaimyo that aggravate Yumiko. The kaimyo is a
Buddhist holy name for the dead that the family buys from the monk who chants
at the funeral: different ranks are available according to how much the
family is willing to pay.  One of my favourite visuals in <i>Just So Happens
</i>is the be-helmeted monk arriving and departing on his motor scooter (page
71?).

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screenshot-2015-04-
28-10.21.52-e1430330035689.png"><img class=" wp-image-4283 size-full
aligncenter"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screenshot-2015-04-28

width="1642" height="757" /></a>

	The playful, childlike image contrasts with the harrumphing holy man in
his robes. Like the Noh actor, the Buddhist monk plays a dramatic role that
he can step into and out of. Everyone seems to accept this but Yumiko. Later,
Yumiko dreams of confronting and striking down the Noh actor who keeps
appearing before her. When she does this the theatre collapses around her as
if representing the edifice of her Japaneseness.

	The death of Yumiko’s father turns out to be something of a red herring,
or at least only one piece of the puzzle Yumiko needs to figure out before
freeing herself into a life in London. After the funeral, she visits her
mother, who did not attend the funeral, in Kyoto. A successful academic, she
rebels against conventional Japanese gender constraints. Yumiko wonders how
well she might have done in a city like New York or London. It dawns on
Yumiko that she has been a satellite of her mother’s desire and ambition, as
she encouraged her to go to London and gave her financial help. In order to
live freely, Yumiko has to liberate herself from that desire and ambition.

	On the flight back to London, Yumiko has a vision of her father on the
mountain side.

/></a>

	While Yumiko tells herself that it is important to believe that nothing
has changed, passing through customs at Heathrow is clearly the threshold
between one life and another.

/></a>

	By engaging with and resolving her ties with one home--Japan--she is able
to become at home in London.

	One of the most interesting features of Fumio Obata’s comic is the
relationship between the form and content. Fumio Obata is a London-based
artist who uses Western comics forms, specifically British comic forms, in
this narrative. In other words, this book is not manga; it has none of the
earmarks of the Japanese form. Rather, it looks like a serious "European"
comic for adults. The colouring is particularly evocative with soft greys and
purples. Some of the colours appear textured, as if painted on watercolor
paper, while the white spaces in the paper do not.  Just as Londonized Yumiko
returns to Japan, so does Obata's Europeanized art.

	Etienne Davodeau's <i>Lulu Anew</i> appeared in French in 2008 and 2010,
and was first published in English in April 2015. The narrative frame is a
family friend, Xavier, telling what he knows to other family friends about
the title character’s adventures when she wanders off from her life after a
frustrating job interview. She's been out of work for so long that she is
blocked out from the labour force. As we progress through the book, though,
we realize that Lulu's frustration extends beyond work. Her husband is a lout
prone to drunkenness. As a mother of a sixteen-year-old daughter (who
narrates part of the story) and two twin boys who appear to be around ten,
she feels the burden of gendered domesticity that has driven her desire for a
job.  When Lulu emerges from her job interview into the urban landscape, we
see something like a version of the suburban United States transferred to
France: there are car dealerships and malls with stores called "BebeLand" and
restaurants called "Buffalo Grill." It is the landscape of meaningless
homogeneity, just the sort of thing one would wander off from.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screenshot-2015-04-
28-11.37.431.png"><img class=" wp-image-4286 size-full aligncenter"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screenshot-2015-04-28
-11.37.431.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-04-28 11.37.43" width="1580"
height="544" /></a>

	When she wanders off, we are not sure that Lulu will ever return to her
family, and the prospect is exhilarating and audacious. Could one just walk
away from the structures of the prison of daily life?

	The narrative framing gives the book a <i>Heart of Darkness</i> or
<i>Ancient Mariner </i>effect, so that even when the drawings show Lulu
directly, the verbal narrative is distanced and filtered. It puts the reader
in the position of being twice removed from the narrative, as the friends who
listen to Xavier and Morgane talk know more about the context than we do. I
wondered more than once whether Lulu had died, though the narrators and their
audience did not seem that mournful. As we progress through the comic, we
understand that someone has died--someone mentions a wake--we just don’t know
who.

	Lulu’s journey has three stages based on the people she meets. Each
relationship facilitates  Lulu’s transition from escaped desperate housewife
into something new.

	A woman she meets in a hotel, Solange, engages her in conversation, gets
her to open up about her problems, and offers to drive her to the coast;
after initially dismissing the idea, Lulu takes her up on it. Once Solange
drops her off, Lulu must fend for herself.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screenshot-2015-04-
28-15.06.35.png"><img class=" wp-image-4278 size-full aligncenter"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screenshot-2015-04-28
-15.06.35.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-04-28 15.06.35" width="1240" height="805"
/></a>

	Lulu is not alone for long as she meets a man while walking along the
beach. Charles is asleep on the beach. He’s like a gift from the sea for
Lulu, and Lulu spontaneously decides that they will have a sexual
relationship while they walk. Charles helps Lulu detach from her family by
throwing away her phone and by introducing her to his two brothers who work
and live with him at a campground. Spontaneity, sex, and freedom are the
defining elements of this segment of Lulu’s journey. Because Charles has
dispensed with her phone, Lulu is freed from the texts and phone calls that
to this point have interrupted her in her picaresque.

	However, Lulu’s old life is always closer than she thinks.  When he finds
out where Lulu is, Xavier travels to the town with the idea of meeting her
and convincing her to come home but once he sees what she is up to becomes
entranced and is unwilling to break the spell. He becomes a spy on the
romance, which is how he gets to be one of the narrators. Charles' brothers
catch him because they too are spying on Charles. Then Morgane brings the
twins to the town by train, and before we know it there’s a whole social
scene going on in the campground.

	Lulu and Charles are oblivious to this scene  in their romantic
bubble. They don’t even know that Lulu’s family and friends have come down to
the coast. This lends a kind of stereoscopic vision of Lulu’s old and new
worlds. It also reminds us that Lulu’s break for the sea is never a complete
one; her new universe is very close to her old one, just in a different
dimension.  Xavier and Lulu’s children return home to leave her to it.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screenshot-2015-04-
28-15.40.11.png"><img class=" wp-image-4279 size-full aligncenter"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screenshot-2015-04-28
-15.40.11.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-04-28 15.40.11" width="838" height="792"
/></a>

	Ultimately, Lulu realizes that being with Charles can only be an
interlude;  she hitchhikes to another coastal town where she stays with an
older woman, Marthe, who takes her in after Lulu snatches her purse and gives
it back. As rent, Lulu must tell Marthe what happened to her at the end of
each day. Men who wash up on beaches and old ladies who exchange stories for
lodging lend <i>Lulu Anew</i> a mythical quality in spite of its realistic
appearance. Lulu is a modern female Odysseus.

	Once the comic changes setting, Morgane takes over the narration: we have
now moved into a narrative space occupied almost entirely by women and
symbolic transactions among them that is much more complex than what happens
in the campground with Charles. When Lulu starts wearing one of Marthe’s
sweaters, we begin to see a symbolic identity between them. Marthe represents
a possible destiny for Lulu, but also a means of looking back over life to
see what is meaningful.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screenshot-2015-04-
28-16.20.54.png"><img class=" wp-image-4280 size-full aligncenter"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screenshot-2015-04-28
-16.20.54.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-04-28 16.20.54" width="1636" height="796"
/></a>

	When Lulu befriends Virginie, a waiter at a bistro who is abused by her
boss, the story crosses three generations. Lulu wants to pay her experience
of freedom forward, as Morgane puts it, by talking Virginie into an escape
that parallels her own. At first Virginie is up for it, but after a
confrontation with her boss, she turns on Lulu and accuses her of trying to
ruin her life. The meaning of Virginie’s refusal to find freedom is difficult
to parse. We might say that between them, Marthe and Virginie are reflections
of Lulu and what has been, will be, and is possible for her. Virginie is also
a possible mirror of Morgane, who, in Lulu’s absence has been assuming
domestic duties at home.

	Ultimately, Lulu invites Marthe along when she decides to return to her
family, which instigates the final transaction. When he learns that Lulu has
returned, Tanguy seeks her out and strikes her, knocking her out cold. He
erroneously thinks he has killed Lulu and runs off. Meanwhile Marthe dies in
a kind of exchange for Lulu’s new life. The death that has been hovering over
the narration throughout has been Marthe’s; while Xavier and Morgane have
been telling the story on the outside patio, Marthe has been lying dead on a
bed in the house, and Lulu has been out looking for Tanguay.

	Like the death of Yumiko’s father in <i>Just So Happens</i>, Marthe’s
death bestows a kind of permission on Lulu to renegotiate the terms of her
contract with life.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screenshot-2015-04-
28-16.44.51.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4281 size-full"

-16.44.51.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-04-28 16.44.51" width="814" height="779"
/></a>

	Both <i>Just So Happens</i> and <i>Lulu Anew</i> explore the
possibilities of comics for representing the transformation of ordinary
people through a journey that disorients their protagonists from their
concept of home so that they can return to reimagine and redefine that
concept. Neither book radically reinvents the form. Rather they are both
exquisite examples of the mature medium of narrative drawing.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is
understands comics as an integral part of any reflection on the cultural
condition in the early 21st century, but&#8230; </p>

	<p>Because I want to address the above, I&#8217;ve been avoiding the
writing of this post. It&#8217;s massive subject and I haven&#8217;t read a
lot of comics lately; they&#8217;re just too fucking depressing. Superman is
a &#8220;false god.&#8221; Spiderman&#8217;s a shit and I don&#8217;t know
what is happening with Thor or Wonder Woman or She-Hulk or any other
big-titted, thigh-gapped figure you wanna name. Daredevil&#8217;s on TV (and
in California in the comic for fucksakes&#8211;hell&#8217;s kitchen my ass);
the Avengers are all explosions, product tie-ins, and awkward press junkets.
Aja and Fraction&#8217;s Hawkeye #22 is taking so long Marvel has launched an
&#8220;All-New Hawkeye&#8221; just to keep us occupied. Also, Ryan Reynolds
is playing Deadpool in the movie version &#8211; read that again, I&#8217;ll
wait. </p>

	<a

class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4307" /></a>

	<p>And don&#8217;t even get me started on the independent scene. I mean,
look at the Chris Ware bit above, how depressing is this? If I have to read
another narrative focused on the slow, plodding, manic unravelling of a
marginalized figure wrestling with the absurdity and secrets of his or her
past (which are so often opaque to the point of non-existence, mired in
complicated structuralist metaphorical associations). Comics are dominated by
stories about an ostracized, depressive, ironic, dispossessed existence. And
I blame the adults for making comics into a straightout shit-show right now,
especially adults who for some bizarre reason are in love with the
1980s&#8211;its video games, Dungeon and Dragons emphasis, and apocalyptic
paranoia (land of confusion indeed&#8230; A-yay-oh). </p>

	<a

class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4306" /></a>

	<p>But then, there&#8217;s <em>Deadpool Killustrated</em> by Cullen Bunn
and Matteo Lolli. In the comic, Deadpool kills off classic characters from
literature, thus rendering the inter-connected character in the Marvel
universe ripped off from the classics dead. It&#8217;s a great way to show
how influence works: kill Ahab, kill Red Hulk. Sure, the comic&#8217;s a few
years old now&#8211;published in 2013&#8211;but it presents an interesting
question: what would happen if there were no stories? Well, that&#8217;s not
quite what it asks, what it really asks is what if there was no characters,
no influence, no underlying cultural production to steal, manipulate,
recontextualize, and reanimate? What it also illustrates, somewhat
haphazardly, is the influence of Western thinking on comics. </p>

	<p>Sometimes, we need a reality check: what would happen if Deadpool cut
in on Seth&#8217;s nostalgic meanderings, or Ware&#8217;s lonely, isolated
women in buildings, Barry&#8217;s frantic self-reflection, Satrapi&#8217;s
political trauma? Thinking about that pushes forward a few necessary tidbits
about comic&#8217;s narratives&#8211;they tend to prioritize a life of
safety, where one can afford leisure, self-reflection, and isolation. I
wonder how relevant that kind of narrative is when we live in a world of near
total surveillance, within a political infrastructure constantly preparing us
for the threat of terrorism&#8211;we&#8217;re ready for Deadpool if he comes
to get us. </p>

	<p>One of the issues of comics as a form of &#8220;academic&#8221; or
cultural discourse is that we sometimes forget that they too are
ideologically loaded. We are now reaping the &#8220;rewards&#8221; of
narratives that asked us &#8220;who watches the watchmen&#8221; or featured
tired old superheroes coming out of retirement or that seamlessly transferred
into another medium, say film, rendering the paper traditions nostalgic. When
we started to praise comics for being literary, calling them graphic novels,
or memoirs (is there a more pretentious word for comics?), or important
cultural commentaries, we opened them up to the ideological scrutiny that
informs their making. </p>

	<p>It&#8217;s time to kill the kanon or, at the very least, acknowledge
that all of it&#8211;yes, I&#8217;m gonna be that definitive&#8211;all of it
is born out of total privilege and ideological security. The only way any of
the comics canon survives scrutiny at this point is if the actual Deadpool
comes outta nowhere to take out Ryan Reynolds. Before we start waxing on
about how representative comics are of one community or another, we might
want to have a look at the corpses that fertilize the soil upon which comics
continue to grow. We might also want to look at how the comics we read
reflect our privilege and foreground the idea that with that privilege comes
a space to seek enlightenment, isolation, historical connections, and
ultimately some resolution or synthesis in life. Because that&#8217;s
bullshit. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>#205 On Alpha Flight, Canada, and Indigenous Appropriation</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Graphixians, I am
writing a conference paper this week, which means that you get to read my
uncollected thoughts towards a conference paper. Aren't you lucky ducks, one
and all.

	As the title suggests, I'm thinking a lot about the way mainstream
American comics signal "Canadianness" by appropriating indigenous characters
as symbolic of north. I came to this by way of Jason Dittmer and Soren
Larsen's article "Aboriginality and the Arctic North in Canadian Nationalist
Superhero Comics, 1940-2004." It's a really interesting look at the way
comics producers in Canada, especially in the Canadian Whites era and with
Captain Canuck, used arctic imagery and (deeply problematic) representations
of First Nations people in order to code comics and situations as
specifically Canadian. I really enjoyed the article and I like Jason
Dittmer's work particularly, and build upon it a lot in other contexts.

	But the article takes a turn that I think lacks some context, and that is
to include without critical reflection Alpha Flight in the annals of the
nationalist superheroes of Canada. I know where this comes from in the
context of Alpha Flight scholarship: Bart Beaty's "The Fighting Civil
Servant" article, wherein he makes an argument for Alpha Flight as being more
successful at representing Canadian region and more successful as a viable
comic book than the aggressively nationalist efforts like Captain Canuck. But
Beaty's reading is nuanced in a way that critics who have come after it have
failed to note: Alpha Flight is not an expressly nationalist comic book. Its
primary goal is not to represent Canada or achieve something meaningful to
Canadian identity, but to be entertaining enough to sell well enough in the
United States to stay on comic book stands.

	Alpha Flight is certainly an all-Canadian superhero team created by an
expatriate Canadian, but it's not itself a Canadian comic -- as part of
Marvel's comic book juggernaut, Alpha Flight always had to serve its
corporate master first. (It's worth reading the letter pages in those early
Alpha Flight comics to see what I mean. Readers who complained about a lack
of geographic or cultural accuracy in the comic were roundly slapped down for
misunderstanding that the comic was fiction.)

	Alpha Flight is definitely part of the tradition of nationalist comics in
that John Byrne was certainly influence by Nelvana of the North, and that
aspect of Dittmer and Larsen's article holds true. But it's worth thinking
about how Alpha Flight uses indigineity to signal Canadianness to an American
audience in the form of Snowbird and Shaman whose powers are deeply connected
to that land. Indeed, Snowbird loses her power when she leaves Canada,
imposing a colonial border upon her and universalizing her indigenous
identity as being specifically Canadian (deeply ironic given the current
challenges some First Nations have in being recognized as superseding imposed
nation-state boundaries).

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/0910_snowbird.jpg"><
img class="aligncenter wp-image-4315"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/0910_snowbird.jpg"
alt="0910_snowbird" width="600" height="399" /></a>

	It's an appropriation of First Nations spirituality to represent Shaman
and Snowbird in these contexts, and we need to be mindful of the fact that
although Alpha Flight's diversity is laudable for its historical context,
it's part of a larger history of white comic artists depicting First Nations
characters for thematic ends. In the case of Alpha Flight, it's also about
defining Canada in terms that are distinct from the US. The foregrounding of
Native characters suggests a different kind of relationship to the land,
nation, and north than is exhibited by, say, the X-Men, the superhero team
Alpha Flight is most commonly either fighting with or against.

	This question is particularly salient given the 2014 launch of another
Canadian superhero – and another appropriation of aboriginal identity – by
Marvel’s competitor DC for their <em>Justice Unlimited</em> series by
Canadian artist Jeff Lemire (famous in Canada for his <em>Essex County</em>).
Again, we see mainstream American representations of Canadian identity coded
through the appropriation of First Nations culture, this time in the
character of Equinox. Lemire’s attempt is more delicate and nuanced, but
still makes assumptions about Canadian identity as inherently indigenous.

/></a> It's worth noting that Equinox is a literal appropriation of a real
woman, the late Shannen Koostachin of Attawapiskat.[/caption]

	The task of the paper is two-fold: to unpack Alpha Flight from this
assumption about it as a nationalist title, and to trace the use of
indigeneity to code Canadian superhero teams and titles as other-than in the
context of mainstream American comics.

	Now I just have to write it.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I have to admit I’ve
felt like I’ve been cheating on my favorite storytelling medium a bit. It’s
not that I haven’t been reading my monthly comics – I haven’t slowed down at
all in this area actually, as I still order roughly fifty titles a month from
the big two and a few from other independent publishers. I’ve purchased all
the summer blockbusters so far, starting to get into DC’s
<em>Convergence</em> (essentially a repeat of Flashpoint with all its various
miniseries and “What If” stylized timelines) and Marvel’s <em>Secret
Wars</em> which is just hitting shelves as of this writing (also essentially
a repeat of Flashpoint with all its various miniseries and “What If” stylized
timelines). Both publishers seem to be locked in a circle of revisiting
overplayed concepts in the form of ending and rebooting universes as the last
and only marketing strategy for a summer event. The fact is, I was beginning
to agree with many in admitting that mainstream comics are getting lazy,
rehashing past successes in order to try to entice new readers. Given this,
like any good addict realizing his fix isn’t quite cutting it anymore, I
decided to try a superhero experience I’d been resisting to this point:
videogames. Not typical Graphixia fare, but it’s an open week and I found a
compelling overlap that I hadn’t been anticipating once the game got its
claws into me.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/coccomic1.jpg"><img
class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4340"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/coccomic1-198x300.jpg
" alt="coccomic1" width="198" height="300" /></a>I fell into it rather
serendipitously - the partner of a colleague of mine happens to be a modeler
for a videogame studio, Kabam, which had just completed designing some
characters for its new game <em>Marvel’s Contest of Champions</em>, the title
(but none of its plot) borrowed from the eponymous 1982 miniseries,
ironically just as <em>Secret Wars</em> borrowed its title from a 1984
miniseries. I heard about the game early on, downloaded it dubiously on
release day, and I immediately became hooked on the repetitive gameplay, the
predictable storyline and the alterations Kabam provided weekly in the form
of new characters or tournaments to keep the game interesting for a few more
months until, likely, everyone was going to move on.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/portrait_marvelous.
jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4343"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/portrait_marvelous.
jpg" alt="portrait_marvelous" width="216" height="264" /></a>Or, perhaps not.
As I’ve been playing the game for months now, I’ve become very familiar with
its small plot thread – the characters of the Marvel Universe have been
kidnapped and are forced to fight by a “Summoner” (essentially the player)
ostensibly for the amusement of masters who are slowly revealed as the
storyline progresses. At first this seemed to be simply a device to move the
game along, but as the veil was lifted on the rather complicated,
continuity-laden and frustratingly grandiose <em>Secret Wars</em> (thanks a
lot, Jonathan Hickman), many of the same devices and characters appeared
there as well. The concept of a “Battleworld,” where superheroes from
alternate dimensions must fight for dominance over one another, appears in
both stories. Characters dusted off from 90’s obscurity are also present in
both, notably an alternate <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Marvel-Contest-of-
Champions.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4341"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Marvel-Contest-of-
Champions-300x225.jpeg" alt="Marvel-Contest-of-Champions" width="300"
height="225" /></a>future version of the Hulk named the Maestro who is, for a
time, in charge of the Battleworld - the reference is obscure enough that
it's very, very unlikely that his arrival could be seen as a coincidence. It
doesn’t take long for anyone “reading” both to realize that while Kabam’s
game arrived earlier, they clearly created it knowing that it would act as a
sort of companion piece to be played alongside <em>Secret Wars</em> without
ever expressly saying so. But the franchise interplay doesn’t end there -
<em>Contest of Champions</em> also, just before the release of the
<em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em> movie, adapted its content by adding in Age
of Ultron side missions and characters to address interest in the villain
inspired by the film. These will likely be phased out and then replaced by
whatever new iteration of Marvel storytelling pops up in another medium,
whether it be a followup comic book event or the next <em>Avengers</em> /
<em>Inhumans</em> / <em>Guardians of the Galax</em>y film.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/maxresdefault.jpg"><
img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4342"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/maxresdefault-300x169
.jpg" alt="maxresdefault" width="300" height="169" /></a>The fluidity and
adaptability of the downloadable, version based videogame as a medium for
storytelling has certainly had an impact on the way that many engage with
narrative – personally, I’ve had my interest reinvigorated in <em>Secret
Wars</em> because of <em>Contest of Champions</em>, knowingly wanting more of
the traditional comic book medium because I feel more engaged with it having
been an actor for various elements of its plot. The message boards in the
game agree, as players shift between discussing the details of the game and
the upcoming comics that Marvel and even DC have forthcoming. I have always
been an advocate for videogames as a means of engaging with story and even
literature (<em>Beowulf</em> on XBox, anyone?) but it is the ability for
online gaming to adapt its content to interact with other narratives in other
media that is compelling and that, likely, will ultimately allow comics to
survive by guiding wayward readers back into the fold – or, hopefully,
actually achieving the new readership that both Marvel and DC are desperately
seeking. And at 33 million individual downloads and counting, <em>Contest of
Champions</em> is impressive if only because it has the ability to act as a
nexus for all other media, reaching far beyond the scope of even the best
selling comic book.

	Having just re-read a few issues of the Modernist magazine
<em>Transition</em> (now THOSE are fun to collect), I can’t help but be
reminded of the way that Joyce would rework his serialized novel, here
<em>Work in Progress</em> and what would eventually become <em>Finnegan’s
Wake</em>, to bitterly respond directly to criticisms of it within the text
itself as he provided more installments. Dickens and Thackeray would do the
same, adapting their narratives to the demands of their readers and extending
or shortening different plot threads in order to accommodate interest and, in
the end, sell more copies of their works. I may have mentioned on the site
how serialized comics can do the same, but I failed to recognize the
potential here not just across time but across media in being able to
accomplish the same goals through an ability to adapt. What’s different, and
arguably more compelling, about how it’s possible to do so now is that the
downloadable version based game can actually overwrite its original
narrative, responding to others by making us forget how we were drawn to it
in the first place – <em>Contest of Champions</em> has morphed into an Ultron
centred game from its boot screen, adding in alliances and team playing that
was never there in its first iteration, though it’s tough to remember it not
having these features as no previous edition remains.

	Regardless of how it ultimately plays out, the experience of working
through a narrative simultaneously across multiple media has problematized
the way that we engage with story – or at least it should. As a librarian, I
am consistently drawn into ominous discussions regarding the death of print
and the shift over to purely digital technologies as a means of accessing
classics and new texts alike. Exercises like those above demonstrate that
this is likely a false binary, tempting in its divisiveness and the ease
through which we can contain what is a far more complex undertaking when
processing fiction in the years to come, whereby we will be expected to read
print, see film and participate as actors concurrently through gaming in
order to fully realize a story’s potential. These affordances are just
beginning to be discovered, manipulated and tested for their potential – and,
as always, comics are leading the way.]]></content:encoded>

<link>http://www.graphixia.ca/2015/06/207-pictures-of-parizeau/</link>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday the state
funeral for Jacques Parizeau took place in Montreal. Parizeau was the leader
of the Parti Québécois from 1988 to 1996 and the 26th Premier of Quebec from
1994 to 1996. In today’s Graphixia post I thought I would take an opportunity
to look at some of the ways in which Parizeau is depicted in the comics
produced in Quebec. Not only does Parizeau appear in a numerous Editorial
Cartoons dating from his early days in politics to the present day, but he
also turns up in a few longer form comics produced in Quebec following the
1995 referendum.

	The production of Editorial Cartoons in Montreal, and indeed Canada, has
been dominated by the works of two men, Terry Mosher (creating under the
pseudonym) Aislin and Serge Chapleau. The way in which these two men,
Anglophone and Francophone respectively, have chosen to depict the key
figures of Quebec and Canada’s recent history has undoubtedly shaped the way
in which the public perceive and conceive of these moments and people. Few
people that have lived in Montreal, and even the province over the past forty
years will not have a favourite cartoon by one or both of these artists.

	The ways in which these two men choose to draw Parizeau are rather
different. Aislin’s Parizeau is large and overwhelming in his sheer bulk and
physicality. Meanwhile Chapleau’s Parizeau is small and generally neatly
dressed in a suit and tie, though with somewhat flyaway hair and beseeching
eyes.

	In 1982, when Parizeau held the post of Finance Manager in Rene
Levesque’s PQ government Aislin drew and published the below cartoon of the
two men.

	&nbsp;

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LEVANDPAR.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4350"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LEVANDPAR-300x256.png
" alt="by Aislin, 1982" width="300" height="256" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	Well sort of, in fact all we are able to see of Levesque are his nose,
forehead and a smidgen of hair. Levesque’s small stature and Parizeau’s large
build are combined by Aislin in a way that perhaps seeks to hint at the way
in which Parizeau’s career will take precedence over Levesque’s in the wake
of the 1980 referendum. More than a decade later we see Aislin draw Parizeau
as a boxer, the so-called Jack the Ripper:

	&nbsp;

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ripper.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4351"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ripper-300x300.png"
alt="by Aislin, 1994" width="300" height="300" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	Again it is Parizeau’s bulk that dominates the frame of this comic and
this is an idea that Aislin returns to time and time again. In this cartoon
we see Parizeau staring intently out at the reader, challenging them, his
eyes are wide and seem somewhat scary. Where cartoons drawn by Aislin of
Levesque and Trudeau show most if not all of their bodies, when it comes to
drawing Parizeau Aislin seems artistically preoccupied with his bulk and less
willing to draw his body.

	&nbsp;

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-06-
11-09.56.27.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4354"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-06-11
-09.56.27-300x300.png" alt="by Aislin, 1994" width="300" height="300" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	In this cartoon from 1994 Aislin draws Parizeau as a deflating balloon,
his body no longer comes into the picture, instead he is just a puffed up
windbag. While we do see cartoons by Aislin where the whole of Parizeau’s
form is drawn, it is striking that he chooses, so often, to focus on just a
small part of his body. Parizeau’s sheer size is therefore reinforced and an
image is built up of a man whose size intimidates those who oppose him.

	Meanwhile Chapleau’s Parizeau is strikingly different. Giddy, childlike
and charmingly inept we don’t get the impression from either of these men
that Parizeau is a particularly subtle politician when it comes to his
methods, but the ways in which they go about reinforcing this idea are very
different.

	&nbsp;

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bike.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4349"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bike-272x300.jpg"
alt="by Chapleau, 1994" width="272" height="300" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	For example in the above cartoon from 1994 we see Chapleau make reference
to Parizeau’s recent victory in the Provincial Elections by drawing him
careering downhill on a decrepit bicycle, requiring stablisers, yelling to
his audience “Follow me”. Further to this in the following cartoon, published
in the same year, we see Parizeau drawn sitting on a see-saw shouting
“Yippee” while the cartoon is entitled “Polls go up, Polls go down”. <img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4352"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SeeSaw-278x300.png"
alt="by Chapleau, 1994" width="278" height="300" />

	&nbsp;

	These depictions of Parizeau where he appears almost childlike are
reinforced when you see the below image from July 1994:

	&nbsp;

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Skates.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4353"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Skates-300x266.jpg"
alt="by Chapleau, 1994" width="300" height="266" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	Parizeau is drawn standing on roller blades, scrabbling to gain his
balance with a horrified and panicked look on his face. He appears to be at
the starting line of what most closely resembles a child’s sports day and as
Parizeau scrabbles for his balance the reader notices that he is in fact not
even facing the right way for the race, the words “Départ” are written facing
the reader and we assume that that is the direction in which Parizeau should
be facing in order to begin the race to the elections.

	Parizeau also appears in Mark Shainblum and Gabriel Morrisette’s 1995
parody <em>Angloman… making the world safe for apostrophes!</em>. Angloman is
the superhero alter-ego of Eaton M McGill supposed “Champion of Bilingualism
and Multiculturalism. Hero of the oppressed. Insurance Underwriter” and he
works from his Fortress of Two Solitudes (Canadian Literature Pun Klaxon) in
downtown Montreal.

	One of the other superheroes in Angloman is the character Capitaine
Souche. Not so loosely based on Parizeau humself Shainblum and Morrissette
describe Capitaine Souche’s occupation as “Crusader against evil, injustice,
and bilingual street signs. Dedicated to <em>souviens</em> until the end of
time.”

	&nbsp;

	<a

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4355"

300x193.png" alt="Mark Shainblum and Gabriel Morrisette" width="300"
height="193" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	Meanwhile in reference to his ‘normal’ alter ego they write that his
career is unknown, “possible retired” (p5). Capitaine Souche is drawn as a
large man, round of stomach wearing a costume consisting of a bodysuit
layered over a pair of trousers, with a cape and small hat. The trousers and
cap are significantly reminiscent of those worn by the Québécois in the past.
His cape is fastened by two letter Q broaches, one on each shoulder, drawn in
the same way as the Q from the Parti Québécois logo. The chest of his costume
bears a logo in the form of a Fleur de Lys divided into two. Capitaine Souche
is “possessed the powers of flight, super strength, and the ability to
generate hot wind storms by invoking the mystic words ‘By Jove’” (ibid).
While they credit him with powers of physical prowess and strength,
everything else about this descriptions works to give an impression of
Parizeau as being too old for his job and generally somewhat out of place.

	Parizeau even makes an appearance in the 1995 Comic Book disguised as a
Colouring-In Book, <em>Quebec Neverendum</em> by Dave Rosen.

	&nbsp;

	<a

	&nbsp;

	There are obviously dozens of cartoonists working in Quebec and Canada
who have taken the time to draw Parizeau over the length of his career all of
whom have chosen different ways in which to convey his personality and
political stance with just a few lines. But the different ways in which these
four men chose to depict Parizeau across the length of his career can give
some insights into the way in which this man was perceived by the public and
how this developed over the years of his long career. It is notable that even
when drawing cartoons that were critical of his politics and policies, they
managed to ensure that their depictions were full of affection for Parizeau
himself.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

the <a

not excluded - Fantagraphics have released Daniel Clowes’ <a

target="_blank"><i>Complete Eightball</i></a> and Drawn &amp; Quarterly have
announced a new <a

just issued a new anthology celebrating the longevity of their alternative
comics publishing house - <a
href="https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/drawn-quarterly-25"
target="_blank"><i>Drawn and Quarterly: Twenty-Five Years of Contemporary
Cartooning, Comics, and Graphic Novels</i></a>. There is a lot to celebrate
and the book features an interview with D&amp;Q head honcho Chris Oliveros,
as well as strips by the generations of cartoonists they have published over
the last 25 years including Doucet, Seth, Chester Brown, Adrian Tomine, Kate
Beaton, and Geneviève Castrée. There is also archival material that D&amp;Q
has reprinted by Tove Jansson, Yoshihiro Tatsumi and Frank King. The book
also features tributes and essays from luminaries such as Margaret Atwood,
Jonathan Lethem, and Hilary Chute. It is an impressive collection and might
take another 25 years to digest fully.

	In his introductory essay Sean Rogers notes how Oliveros was determined
to set up a publishing company that <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/arts/design/25-years-of-drawn-
quarterly-champion-of-female-cartoonists.html" target="_blank">challenged</a>
the ‘private boy’s club’ of comics at the time - D&amp;Q sought gender
equality in the artists they published, and with their staff. The first issue
of the <a href="http://www.comics.org/issue/306103/" target="_blank"><i>Drawn
&amp; Quarterly</i></a> anthology in 1990 featured twice as many men as woman
but it was a start, and the cover featured a striking drawing of a woman
creating comics by Anne D. Bernstein. D&amp;Q helped further redress the
gender imbalance by putting out Julie Doucet’s <a
href="https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/dirty-plotte-01"
target="_blank"><i>Dirty Plotte</i></a> as their first single author book (as
<a href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/author/hattiek/">Hattie</a> says “No
Doucet, No Dice!”). Today they continue to champion female cartoonists by
publishing books by Miriam Katin, Rutu Modan, and Jillian Tamaki among many
others.

	I hadn’t noticed a specific agenda when I began picking up books by
D&amp;Q in the early 1990s, I just thought that they were releasing great
comics. Although this was also the time that Riot Grrrl and third wave
feminism were beginning. Riot Grrrl helped crystallise much of my political
thinking, so seeking out books by great female creators was part of that. My
reading at the time included<i> Dirty Plotte</i>, Mary Fleener’s
<i>Slutburger</i>, and Debbie Drechsler’s <i>Nowhere</i> from D&amp;Q, as
well as Roberta Gregory’s <i>Naughty Bits</i> from Fantagraphics, and
<i>Nocturnal Emissions</i> by Fiona Smyth published by Vortex Comics. Yes, I
was reading <i>Hate</i>, <i>Eightball</i>, <i>Palookaville</i>, etc as well
but that's another story.

	Over the last 25 years the choice in comics reading has grown
exponentially, but one person that I’ve missed in comics since the 1990s is
Toronto based artist Fiona Smyth. Like Doucet, who studied printing and moved
from making comics and zines to creating sculptures, prints and book-art
works for gallery shows, Smyth studied painting and printmaking but her
comics work was always just one element of her creative practice. According
to a 1994 article in the <a href="http://mruttan.ca/reviews/Fiona.html"
target="_blank">Montreal Mirror</a> Smyth was a painter, video director,
musician, AND a comics artist. Smyth’s comics career was seemingly even more
brief than Doucet’s. Smyth does get a passing mention as a contributor in the
new D&amp;Q book as she featured in the first volume of the <i>Drawn &amp;
Quarterly </i>anthologies (issues 5-8) and <i>Fabulous Babes</i> issue 1 from
D&amp;Q, however her own solo book <i>Nocturnal Emissions</i> was published
by Toronto’s Vortex Comics.

	There were only four issues of <i>Nocturnal Emissions</i> between 1991
and 1994 (and I seem to be missing number 3, anyone?). In issue 4 Smyth signs
off on the letters page, in which readers detailed their dreams, by saying
she will print more in the next, bigger issue. Sadly issue 5 never
materialised. Issue 4 was the last comic published by Vortex before they went
out of business in 1994. Chester Brown’s <i>Yummy Fur</i>, perhaps their
biggest comic,<i> </i>had defected to D&amp;Q a couple of years earlier and
publisher Bill Marks had become more concerned in pursuing his interests in
NASCAR themed comics.

Stuff</em> #16 (1993) (right). Covers by Fiona Smyth.[/caption]

	During the four years that <i>Nocturnal Emissions</i> was being published
I sought out any work by Smyth that I could find. And this was before the
internet kids, I had to rely on what turned up in the local comic shops in
Glasgow. She popped up on the cover of issue 16 of Dennis Eichhorn’s <i>Real
Stuff</i> in ‘93 (I was a big fan of Eichhorn’s slice of life work at the
time) and she did a fantastic cover for the first issue of <i>Girltalk </i>in
‘94 (a split issue with <em>Real Girl</em> #7). That cover is like a
distillation of Smyth’s work at the time - it depicted a blue-faced
multi-armed goddess figure with a flaming vagina, wearing platform heels and
fiercely exclaiming the title “Girltalk”. Three smaller blue goddesses are
shooting out of the first one’s vagina, smiling and introducing the contents
of the comic from speech bubbles coming out of their mouths. The colours are
deep and rich, reds, purples, blues and oranges. It demands to be picked up
and barely needs the “read me” tagline on the bottom.

	[caption id="attachment_4400" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FS_NE-5s.jpg"><img

width="600" height="892" /></a> Page from 'Toad in the Hole' - <em>Nocturnal
Emissions</em> #2 by Fiona Smyth[/caption]

	The covers to <i>Nocturnal Emissions</i> are similarly eye-catching, all
purple, green, blue and orange with thick painterly lines, featuring punk
girls, religious icons, and strange creatures with penis like appendages on
their heads and bodies, looking like the mugwumps in David Cronenberg’s
<i>Naked Lunch</i> adaptation. The back cover of the first issue features a
portrait of a heroine of Smyth's - Frida Kahlo, with blue skin, a vagina-like
third eye, and a crown-like flaming vagina floating above her head (another
familiar Smyth icon). With all this going on you still notice the eyes, as
Jack Ruttan noted <a href="http://mruttan.ca/reviews/Fiona.html"
target="_blank">“It's the eyes that grab you first. Knowing eyes, foreign
eyes, doe-like baby-doll soulful eyes. The eyes of Fiona Smyth's women.”</a>
Smyth’s characters are sensual, and the comics are filled with sex, and
liminal dream-like hallucinogenic states.

	[caption id="attachment_4401" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FS_NE-4s.jpg"><img

alt="Page from 'Gert' - Nocturnal Emissions #4 by Fiona Smyth" width="600"
height="933" /></a> Page from 'Gert' - <em>Nocturnal Emissions</em> #4 by
Fiona Smyth[/caption]

	The insides of the comics are printed in black and white on cheap
newsprint but they are no less psychedelic (or as Smyth might prefer “<a
href="http://www.conundrumpress.com/backlist/nog-a-dod/"
target="_blank">psychadoolic</a>”). Smyth uses pens and brushes to cover
every inch of the page in intense scribbles and squiggly lines (and countless
erect penises, flaming vaginas, and winged breasts) evoking the trippy feel
of taking LSD. The first story is about a stoner called Toad caught in an
apparent acid flashback (‘Toad in the Hole’) which turns into a quest in the
perpetual limbo of the ‘The Land of Wet Dreams’ - the comic is called
<i>Nocturnal Emissions</i>, you knew where it was going, right? The other
strip is ‘Gert the Mannequin’ about a woman who leaves the city for a quieter
life away from all the sex and drugs that were “gettin her down.” Gert ends
up as housekeeper in a Catholic church, settling down and ignoring the
advances of the local rednecks. She seems content until Hutch, a groovy
rocker with a bulge in his trousers, turns up to divert her attentions back
to lust. As Gert spots him Smyth draws her doe eyes twinkling with stars and
squiggly lines in an (acid) flashback to her sex-filled previous life. The
plots are not groundbreaking but the whole psychadoolic experience and
hedonistic enthusiasm carries the reader along. The back-up strips are brief
stories of dreams (‘I Dreamt I was Burt Reynolds’), erotic doodles, and real
life events - one of Smyth’s art exhibitions predicts the Challenger shuttle
disaster. The art is black and white but somehow still seems to be bright and
colourful.

	For a long time I thought I wouldn’t be reading any new material from
Smyth, like Doucet she seemed to be concentrating on her fine art career.
However, the truth is that Fiona Smyth never went away. She has continued to
work on her art, illustration, and comics since releasing <i>Nocturnal
Emissions</i> way back in the 1990s, as well as teaching at Ontario College
of Art and Design. About 10 years ago I picked up a copy of <a
href="http://artpost-cheez.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank"><i>Cheez
100</i></a>, a collection of her 1-page comics for <i>Exclaim! </i>magazine,
and in 2011 she released <a href="http://annickpress.com/Never-Weres-The"
target="_blank"><i>The Never Weres</i></a>, a science fiction graphic novel
for teenagers, which I have not yet managed to read. The work is still
coming, it seems that it was just me that wasn’t paying attention.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[It's midnight as I
write this, and I'm in Paris. I was supposed to be home in London by now, but
some striking ferry workers started a fire in the channel tunnel, and when I
tried to get a flight I was more or less laughed out of Charles de Gaulle
airport. C'est la vie.

	That's relevant because I have, for the last couple of days, been at the
joint Sixth International Graphic Novels and Comics Conference/Ninth
International Bande Dessinée Conference here. The conference is on all week -
I highly recommend you follow the action on the hashtag <a
href="https://mobile.twitter.com/search/?q=%23IGNCC15&amp;s=hash"
target="_blank">#IGNCC15</a> - but I could only take two days off from my day
job to attend. Still, I packed a lot in and saw some great papers, and was
challenged to extend some of my own research into comics into the content, as
well as the context, of the comic I gave a paper on. And as this post isn't
part of a particular series, I thought I'd take the opportunity to write a
little about my paper and to get my early thoughts down on future
developments, as they're fresh in my mind, and as I can't sleep. So this post
will be part conference report, part re-hash of my paper, part thoughts on
the future of my own research, and part midnight-oil sleep-deprived rambling.
So, apologies if you wanted more than a curious assemblage, but this is where
I'm at right now.<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4415"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image-1024x766.jpg"
alt="Bone_1" width="1024" height="766" /></a>The title of my paper at the
conference was "A Singular Creative Vision: Jeff Smith and the production of
<i>Bone</i>," and in it I examined <i>Bone</i>'s publishing history, Jeff
Smith's approach to it as a self-publisher, and his success as a businessman
as well as the writer and artist of one of the most successful all-ages
graphic novels this side of the millennium. I drew from my own research into
Comics and Cultural Work, which is a big part of my thesis and a book I'm
working on, and also on neoliberal political economy, both of which presented
quite different readings of <i>Bone</i> that I then married together, holding
up the 1,300-page trade paperback and yelling at the assembled crowd that
it's such a huge book because it needs to encapsulate all these tensions. I
think that's how it went down, anyway.

	If you're not familiar with <a
href="http://comicsforum.org/comics-forum-archives/website-archive/comics-and
-cultural-work/" target="_blank">Comics and Cultural Work</a>, I would advise
you to check out the series on it that ran on Comics Forum at the end of
2013. Put simply, the idea with it is to understand comics at all levels,
through all producers, moving away from the "narrow auteurist vision of
production" that has characterised much of the discourse of comics studies,
and to understand comics as cultural work, a term drawn from contemporary
sociology. For <i>Bone</i>, this meant giving a major credit to Jeff Smith's
wife Vijaya Iyer, who is also the president of his company, Cartoon Books,
and who managed much of the business side of <i>Bone</i> in the 1990s and
early 2000s. The cultural work reading situates <i>Bone</i> as the product of
a collective, collaborative work between husband and wife, the "signs of
their cooperation" (Becker, 1) being the phenomenal success of <i>Bone</i>.

	The neoliberal reading, on the other hand, situates Jeff Smith as a lone
genius because of his auteurism, his "singular creative vision" (his own
words, from the acknowledgments page of the <i>Bone</i> trade paperback), and
his entrepreneurialism, as a cartoonist who put together a business plan to
get <i>Bone</i> off the ground and weather the storm of self-publishing
through the challenging economic conditions of the 1990s and the difficult
market for comics at the time. My paper made an attempt to present both these
readings and to draw them together.

	The neoliberal reading was a greater point of intrigue, as Marc Singer
had delivered a paper on Persepolis and the neoliberal self earlier in the
day. Paul Williams, who chaired the panel, challenged me to extend the
neoliberal reading to <i>Bone</i>'s content, and in particular to its three
protagonists, the <i>Bone</i> brothers. I thought this was a great challenge
and an important question to ask - scholars examining texts in the areas of
work and political economy like me often look very closely at context, and
less closely at content, when actually there is probably much that the
content has to offer to enrich such a reading.

	In this case, the neoliberal reading, when extended to the three Bone
cousins, reveals much about their characters and, by way of reflection, about
neoliberal political economy and how it plays out in unseen ways in popular
culture.

	To clarify on the meaning of neoliberalism, just in case: it's a word
that refers, at least for my purposes, to the idea that free market
capitalism, and the implications that this has for the self, the body and
material space, including deregulation and emphasis on the self and
individual autonomy, is the only logical and rational way to build a stable
society. It's a philosophy that is seen as underpinning much of western
government since the mid to late 1970s, taking off fully in the
Thatcher-Reagan era. Robert McChesney said it best, in my opinion, calling it
"capitalism with the gloves off." In cultural criticism and philosophy,
Foucault put forward the idea of the <i>homo oeconomicus</i> in his 1978-9
lectures at the College de France, just before he died, stating that under
the growing neoliberal consensus man had been forced to become an economic
man, an entrepreneur, in order to survive under western capitalism.

alt="cowrace" width="670" height="1024" /></a>

	So, to wrap up my ramble, here are my off-the-cuff thoughts on the Bone
cousins in the context of neoliberalism. Phoney Bone, the scheming, miserly
troublemaker, is almost a <i>homo oeconomicus</i>, with his constant,
hyperbolic drive for money and his attempts to gain it by any means
necessary. His rigging of the Great Cow Race (spoiler alert, if you haven't
read it) could even be seen as a reflection of the failure of neoliberalism
to temper its worst excesses - I'm thinking here of the rigging of markets in
the financial sector, such as the <a

scandal</a> and the excess of bankers' bonuses. If the Great Cow Race is a
free market, it should self-regulate, and Phoney Bone should be able to get
by within it based purely on the entrepreneurial skill he possesses. But
still, he has to rig it, taking his own selfishness - the neoliberal emphasis
on self - to its logical conclusion. His schemes never come through for him,
though, so neoliberalism is not validated in Phoney Bone, even if he does
embody it.

	Smiley Bone, the grinning, cigar-chomping, positive Bone, represents the
invisible power of neoliberalism and the pervasiveness of it portraying
itself as rational and logical, and thus making itself invisible. Smiley
knows, deep down, that it is wrong to go along with Phoney's schemes, and to
dress up as a cow to fix the race (again, spoiler alert). But still he goes
along with it, in thrall to Phoney and his aggression, sleepwalking into
neoliberalism as western democracy has done.

	And then there's the main protagonist, Fone Bone. Thankfully, and
graciously, he is the antidote to neoliberalism. His whole reason for being
is to stop the war, save the valley, to protect Thorn, and ultimately to
deliver his cousins back to their home in Boneville. All of which are
purposes greater than money, greater than the free market, greater
philosophically than anything Phoney can pull out of his neoliberal hat. And
though Phoney almost succeeds, ultimately it is Fone Bone and his obscured
labour - his cultural work, perhaps - that constitutes the greatest part of
the Bone cousins' collaboration on their epic journey.

	So there's something to chew on: the next time you pick up a successful,
award-winning, all-ages graphic novel, you might be reading a reflection of
the worst excesses of free market capitalism. But it's more than likely that
some hero, like Fone Bone, will altruistically save you from it and take you
away - away from neoliberalism, and back to Boneville, wherever your
Boneville may be.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I see neoliberalism as essentially a return to
classical liberalism, but with more of a focus on economics, and with
applications to late capitalism and globalisation. I find it interesting in
my research because it is directly applicable to many of the comics I study,
and much of the comics canon, by virtue of having been a growing political
consensus through the Thatcher-Reagan years to the present day. So it's more
relevant to Bone than a reading drawing on classical liberalism would be, I
think. But I might think about making the comparison in another paper, some

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Comic strips are clear
products of modernity, “born” at a time of intense industrialization,
urbanization and growing mediatization: they are rooted in a fast-changing
urban culture, with its array of new technologies, attractions and
spectacles. Thematically, then, comic strips depicted this urban environment
from scratch, with panels packed with the new objects of modernity. The
variegated connections between modernity, other then-new media, and comic
strips have recently been wonderfully charted by comics scholars as Scott
Bukatman, Jared Gardner, Thierry Smolderen, and Alain Boillat, opening up a
large field of inquiry that remains to be tapped, in a way that challenges
the dominant presentist trend in comics studies. This post does not pretend
to bring anything new to this discussion, but is just inspired by this kind
of approach and rehearses it (or so I hope at least) by focusing on the place
of the <em>automobile </em>as an engine of modernity in early comic strips by
the three “big” names of the time: Winsor McCay, George Herriman, and Frank
King.

	Portraying the modern urban experience, comic strips often featured new
transportation technologies – the subway, the electric trolley, the
automobile – and often parodied modernistic futures, imagining how cities
would be filled with strange flying objects. It seems only natural that the
motorcar, which emerged alongside comics, would prominently feature in them:
and so we find strips that very much revolve around the automobile, as in
George Herriman’s <em>Prof. Otto and His Auto </em>(1902), Sidney Smith’s
<em>Old Doc Yak </em>(1908-1917), Frank King’s <em>Look Out for Motorcycle
Mike! </em>(1913) and of course <em>Gasoline Alley </em>(1918-present), the
first runs of Harry Herschfield’s <em>Abie the Agent </em>(1914-1940), and we
frequently encounter cars in Winsor McCay’s various works, Richard F.
Outcault’s <em>Buster Brown,</em> Frederick B. Opper’s <em>Happy Hooligan
</em>or <em>Our Antediluvian Ancestors </em>(notably featuring a prehistoric
motorcar), and others. Incidentally, many of those cartoonists, King and
Smith for instance, were themselves crazed automobilists. In the first two
decades of the century, playfully recuperating stories of havoc-wreaking
motorcars that populated the pages of the newspaper, the comic supplement
displayed an array of strips representing speed machines that hyperbolically
smashed everything up along their way, piling shocks upon shocks.

alt="graphixia1" width="379" height="397" /></a>

	<strong> </strong>

	<strong> </strong>

	In one of his <em>Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend </em>strip, Winsor McCay,
under the pen name Silas, portrays the arrival of a countryside fellow to the
big city, completely out of pace with its disorientating bustle. Trying to
cross over Broadway, he is repeatedly run over by different vehicles that
literally tear him into pieces. McCay piles up the same action three times,
mapping a range of vehicles. The itemization is not coincidental here, and
the poor man moves to being squashed by a horsecar, a carriage, an electric
trolley, and by an automobile. The strip does not only represent the variety
of vehicles that crowded the city streets, or an evolution of transportation,
it also mimics a technological progress where the newest is also the worst,
finishing off the character.

	&nbsp;

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/graphixia2.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4426"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/graphixia2.jpg"
alt="graphixia2" width="2420" height="1393" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	In a lesser-known strip published two weeks earlier, McCay shifts
perspective and focalizes on the driver of the deadly machine. There, the
automobilist takes great pleasure in the kind of shocks that will later be
inflicted upon the rube character. Side by side with an uneasy and horrified
passenger, the driver revels in the destructive technology he is empowered
with. In each panel, he tells his friend about what he is going to hit,
forecasting the background chaos of the next picture. Here again we find an
escalation: the car not only beats its competitors, first the horse carriage
then the trolley, it further breaks through a brick building (and an old
people’s home at that), and finishes by over running a mass of people (“Hear
the bones cracking?”), already alluding to the strip’s next installment.
These strips powerfully rely on repetition and itemization to represent the
shock-experience of modernity that is embodied in the characters' relation to
speed machines. Relying on dark humor, McCay presents a dual relationship
with modernism that has been perceptively pinpointed by Katherine Roeder as
“maintaining the delicate balance between anxiety and amusement” (2014: 181).

	&nbsp;

	George Herriman, in one of his first comic strips, <em>Prof. Otto and His
Auto</em> (1902) takes up the new shock of speeding automobiles by developing
a character who does just that, repeatedly driving his car Sunday after
Sunday (for only about 10 months, though). Herriman’s strip, some years
before the appearance of the first mass-produced cars, embraced the pleasure
of driving at speed as a thrilling experience (on that subject, see Enda
Duffy's fascinating <em>The Speed Handbook </em>(2009)). Of course, Herriman
does not entirely leave aside a certain undertone of anxiety: the automobile
is portrayed as the same death-dealing technological engine as in McCay’s
strips. The driver and his machine are animated by a fantastic glee in
crashing and smashing into everything, from other cars to buildings and
people. In its ultimate installment on December 28 in 1902, Prof. Otto takes
the resolution to “run over nothing but snowmen,” alluding to his long record
as dangerous ‘death driver’ well-known to his readers. Following a typical
New Year’s joke, Prof Otto ends up crashing into a snow-covered man, thereby
breaking his resolution. Here, however, the tone and register are quite
different than in McCay's two pages. The strip is somewhat softened (at least
there is no horrific grinding of a dog’s body or the likes), the shocks and
crashes are much less harrowing, being rather presented as slapstick gags,
and the passenger is an enthusiastic follower rather than a terrified
witness. This tonal difference is further underpinned by Herriman’s rounded
and dynamic style, contrasting with the detailed precision of McCay’s Art
Nouveau style.

	&nbsp;

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/graphixia3.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4427"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/graphixia3.jpg"
alt="graphixia3" width="1198" height="705" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	While portrayed as a cataclysmic technology, it is precisely this chaos
that suggests its pleasure as Otto persistently comes out undamaged from his
countless calamitous rides – signaling a resilient plasticity typical of
early comic strip characters, as brilliantly analyzed by Jared Gardner
(2012). It is not insignificant that, for one of his first
recurring-character strips, Herriman chose to focus on a character that is
virtually grafted onto his car. The resilience of his body is interwoven with
his position as a driver: no matter what he and his car endure, Otto always
comes out undamaged, reappearing every Sunday for another series of shocks
and collisions.

	A strip published on April 20, 1902 illustrates this mild form of cyborg
subjectivity. Prof. Otto gives a ride to two impish children, who want the
car to go fast. In this race across the countryside, the strip stages a
topical confrontation between technology and nature, but in a completely
different tone. Prof. Otto, cheered by his two young passengers, is turning
upside down a somewhat idyllic and fertile countryside, flashing by helpless
and dumbfounded farmers. The running gag is that no matter how recklessly he
drives, Otto never succeeds in gratifying the children’s wish, who keep
yelling ‘faster,’ then spelt ‘f-a-s-t-e-r,’ possibly suggesting the trill of
their voices due to the twitching vehicle (here again, technology affects the
human sensorium). In the last panel of the page, Otto lies in a strange
position, apparently exhausted by the race: his legs protrude through the
bodywork of the motorcar. This is not an instance of bad artistry, I think,
but rather a case of two bodies welded together into a 'cyborg subject.'

	&nbsp;

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/graphixia4.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4428"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/graphixia4.jpg"
alt="graphixia4" width="1200" height="1426" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	To construct this resilient body, Herriman makes an inventive use of the
grid. While most sequential comic strips would depict the movement of the
characters from a fixed perspective and against a fixed background, <em>Prof.
Otto </em>displays an automobile that keeps eluding the sequential
arrangement of panels. Though the comic maintains a fixed–and nearly
panoramic–perspective, the car seems to persistently avoid its focal point:
it goes so fast that it is rarely positioned at the center of the panel, and
it always zooms by at the borders of the frame, leaving behind a dust cloud.
What we are shown, then, are the (destructive) effects left behind by the
race of Otto and his auto: as McCay, Herriman multiplies the shocks across
the page; the strip as a whole displays an explosive variety of different
collisions, which the automobilist persistently comes through.

	&nbsp;

	The same formal trope and iterative structure would be used a decade
later by Frank King who, in <em>Look Out for Motorcycle Mike! </em>(1913),
gives it another creative twist by introducing a comic discrepancy between
the repetition of crashes and the perception of the motorcyclist. <em>Look
Out for Motorcycle Mike! </em>was a short-lived comic strip based on the
typical motif of the trip around the world. This was one of the first
narrative devices used by cartoonists to introduce some narrative continuity
into gag strips, although part of the pleasure involved in its use was that
the same gag was held no matter where the character went (Gardner 2013: 242).
This combination of loop and narrative is a core feature of Frank King’s
strip, in which Motorcycle Mike, touring the world at incredible speed,
continually destroys everything on his way, blowing up to pieces the
buildings in a frenzy reminiscent of Herriman’s machine in the countryside.

	&nbsp;

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/graphixia5.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4429"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/graphixia5.jpg"
alt="graphixia5" width="1082" height="381" /></a>

	&nbsp;

	The humor of the strip, however, lies not only in the uproarious antics
of jolting and bumping vehicles, but also in that the character does not even
notice the ruin he is causing. Indeed, the speech balloons make it clear that
Motorcycle Mike is simply blind to his destructive trajectory. On April 6,
for instance, he razes through Korea, commenting on the ‘flimsy architecture’
he is (unconsciously) knocking down, noticing that “it’s a wonder they
wouldn’t building these things right on my road.” The gag is strengthened by
the ability of the reader, upon reading the last panel, to look ‘back’ at the
other panels, to take in the succession of explosions that pave Mike’s way.

	The humor, however, is slightly bittersweet and ambivalent: the
motorcycle, as a prosthetic device, empowers its rider, but it also makes him
blind to the causes of that empowerment. The caveat holds that this ecstatic
experience is at a cost with the cultural heritage of the countries visited.
In this sense, the strip is an essentially comic satirization of progress,
more readily aligned with McCay’s dark <em>Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend</em>.
King does not uphold the same melancholic or anxious undertone, portraying
with gusto the antics of a motorcyclist.

	&nbsp;

	Nevertheless, these three examples, and more specifically the King and
Herriman ones, are short-lived, though, and it seems that the car as a
fantastical attraction would quickly subside as it became more and more
common to drive around. And so, simultaneously with the democratization of
the automobile, comic strips would increasingly turn to narrative continuity
and family melodrama in which the cars take on a completely different role:
this shift seems evident in King's <em>Gasoline Alley</em>, but I feel it is
also present in Sidney Smith and Harry Herschfield's works. But that is an
assumption and a thread I will need to pick up later.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Alex and Ada</span></i><span style="font-weight:
400;">,by Sarah Vaughn and Jonathan Luna, follows in a long line of science
fiction literature and comics that questions the relations between humans and
robots: Philip K. Dick's </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do
Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,
Naoki Urasawa's </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Pluto</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the Clamp
collective's </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Chobits,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for example.
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chobits</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> is perhaps the most relevant intertext because of
the way it presents the robot as love/sex object, toying with the idea of the
ultimate sex toy: a compliant humanoid figure that avoids the messiness and
resistance of a relationship with a self-determining being.</span>

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_0488.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4435"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_0488.jpg"
alt="IMG_0488" width="1666" height="1026" /></a>

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therein lies the tension: it seems as if
the comic wants to have its robot and eat it too, to have the robot both
possess free will and be sexually compliant. In fact, Alex receives a female
robot from his grandmother, who has a Tanaka X5 named Daniel as a lover.
Alex's grandmother celebrates the uncomplicated sexual pleasures of having a
robot partner. She is perfectly satisfied with her X5, so why shouldn't Alex
enjoy one too? The facts that Alex has recently broken up with his
girlfriend, is 27 years old and has no one else on the relationship horizon
answers that question.  But Alex is a complicator. He seeks illegal means of
unlocking Ada’s sentience, as he sees in his robot the potential for full
human existence.  But what are the criteria for such an existence? </span>

	&nbsp;

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the face of it, the concern with
‘sentience’ in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex and
Ada</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows the anxiety of being
unable to distinguish a machine with artificial intelligence from a human
being. That is, in its fictional rendering of a struggle for robot rights and
free will, the comic presents a fear that human beings are actually robots
without those qualities. The clean, smooth art style along with the flat
colouring that presents human beings as relatively featureless illustrate
this anxiety. Characters look made out of plastic or perhaps rubber: like
action figures from the 1970s.  For the issue is not organic versus
inorganic, but sentient vs insentient. The body initially appears irrelevant
in this comic; it is merely the carrier of the mind. </span>

	&nbsp;

	<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex and Ada</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> opens with a news story on a quashed robot
uprising: in an instance of artificial intelligence gone awry, machines have
attacked humans in an apparent eruption of irrationality (or maybe revenge
for being oppressed by their human overlords), creating an atmosphere of fear
about robots and what they might do. This fear is the flipside of the “what
if humans are really robots” anxiety: on the one hand emotionless, mechanical
action; on the other irrational outburst. In each case, concepts of
intelligence and sentience are figuratively “beyond us.” We don’t trust them
inside us, and we don’t know what they will do next. While most of the time
they merely seem to allow us to perform dull, rote activities, they present
incomprehensible affective moments, like falling in love or being struck by
an idea. </span>

	&nbsp;

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">In any event, robot uprising has
parallels with 9/11, and the attacks on robots that follow evoke what has
happened to Muslims in western countries. This deflection of otherness onto
robots is curious and typical. In Urasawa’s </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Pluto</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,
for instance, an anti-robot organization dresses just like the KKK. The idea
of the robot as stand in for the Other (in terms of race, ethnicity, gender
and/or class) fascinates me because it could be construed as either an
occlusion/denaturing of otherness or an allegorical way of getting at the
subject.</span>

	&nbsp;

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Alex and Ada</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the
relationship between sentience and the sexualized body can perhaps explain
this paradox. Ada looks exactly like a human being, or at least exactly like
the other human beings in this comic, apart from a "T" trademark on her
wrist. This ‘human’ similarity of appearance in Ada and her capacity for
sexual engagement is in fact crucially important to Alex’s desire to “bring
her to life.” Although Alex resists the claims of other characters that he is
only in it for the sex--"Do you want personality </span><b>and</b><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> complete servitude?" (Issue 4. Vol 1)--the fact of
the matter is that this comic depends on the sexual tension between the two
characters. If it was a Jane Austen novel, </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Alex and Ada</span></i><span style="font-weight:
400;"> would be called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sex and
Sentience</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So the de-emphasis on
the body turns out to be something of a ruse; really the body signifies
sexuality and must be given a mind to match. If the comic wished to avoid a
Pygmalion scenario, it would have created a different context. Again, we have
a cake/ eat it too situation: this comic is not about sex but...why not!
</span>

	<a

class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4436"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_0489.jpg"
alt="IMG_0489" width="1828" height="967" /></a>

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">As with other robot comics, some of the
robots in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex and
Ada</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> look absolutely human-like,
others look like crash test dummies, while still others look like barely
anthropomorphised machines for accomplishing tasks. This range allows us to
visualize the robots in “evolutionary” terms: just as we can visualize the
different variants of pre-historic man leading up to modern humanity. But
there is no necessity that artificial intelligence of the highest order be
placed in a simulacrum of a human body and not in Alex’s kitchen robot, Otto,
for example. Otto speaks, and serves Alex like a butler, but Alex shows no
desire to liberate him into whatever sentience might be available to him.
 Indeed he has no qualms about making Otto serve Ada: Otto is to give her
anything she asks for. Perhaps the prospect of non- or less-humanoid robots
with sentience is more terrifying than sympathetic, like Hal in <em>Space
Odyssey</em> or the awesome Brau 1589 in </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Pluto</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_0230.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4438"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_0230.png"
alt="IMG_0230" width="641" height="652" /></a>

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the human beings in
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex in Ada</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> exist within a web of communications technology
via implants in their brain. They can call up holographic screens to watch
the news and use their brains to make silent "phone calls" to each other. The
question arises whether human beings in such a context are more than nodes in
a mechanical network. If so, the focus on the “subject” in this comic is a
distraction from that network and the possibility that humans are not even
robots, but rather mere parts in a larger, sublime machine.  The precise,
inorganic looking art, with a lot of ruler work--tons of straight lines and
right angles--in addition to the previously noted inhuman appearance of the
characters suggests such a scenario. Rather than “robots rights”
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex and Ada</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> is more about the loss of humanity in this
machine. Guys like Alex become the “Other” to the machine, while the problems
of women, muslims, and other “others” get subsumed and mostly erased in the
general problems of “humanity.” This reading would suggest that the robot as
“Other” is an occlusion of race, ethnicity, gender, and class. </span>

	&nbsp;

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">These thoughts are based on the first two
collected volumes of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex and
Ada</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s possible that subsequent
developments in the narrative could put the comic on a different track and
complicate the so far typical robot story.  But if Alex turns out to be a
robot himself, I wouldn’t be surprised. </span>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What would a sexual
liaison between The Thing and She-Hulk be like? Given our theme this round,
of human / inhuman, these are the kinds of questions that occur to me.
I&#8217;m thinking about how sexuality, as it is represented off the pages of
North American superhero comics, often problematizes how we might think about
sexual activities. While superheroes often find themselves in situations that
would lead to&#8211;or even require&#8211;the consummation of a relationship
in a physical way, we rarely think about Supes &#8220;doing it&#8221; or even
how their genitalia might be represented given their superpowers. </p>

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graphixia-212-1.jpg"
><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graphixia-212-1-
892x1024.jpg" alt="graphixia-212-1" width="892" height="1024"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4448" /></a>

	<p>First up, let&#8217;s talk seriously about how mainstream superhero
comics represent sexual activity: they don&#8217;t. The only one that comes
immediately to mind, and I&#8217;m not sure its creator would be happy with
it being mainstream, is <em>Watchmen</em>. There are several sexual scenes in
<em>Watchmen</em>, all involving one version or another of Silk Spectre
(because you can only have one female lineage to have sex with I guess). That
said, the scene that illustrates our uncomfortable relationship with
sexuality and superheroes is nicely articulated in the image above. </p>

	<p>Freaking out over Dr. Manhattan&#8217;s self-twosome&#8211;the product
of his &#8220;universal&#8221; powers&#8211;is pretty much what any of us
would do when confronted with the possibility of superhero sex. Let&#8217;s
think about the dynamics at play here: Dr. Manhattan is a reconstruction of
molecules, he can see forward and back, he can be two places at once, he can
read minds. So, he knows exactly how Laurie will respond to this, and other
advances (which is creepy because he freaks her out anyway). Despite the
comic&#8217;s concentration on the personal dynamics of their relationship,
we can&#8217;t help but wonder how the sex would go down. Who or what is
Laurie having sex with exactly? And, how good is he at pleasuring her? (He
should be unbelievable in bed.) Where does his or her libido come from?
(Sorry, awkward pun there&#8230; it&#8217;s hard to write about sex.) How
does Dr. Manhattan experience sexual pleasure? How does Laurie know when he
is experiencing sexual pleasure&#8211;did Jon reconstruct his inner junk, so
to speak? </p>

	<p>Speaking of junk (and this is by far my favourite part of writing on
this subject), how exactly is the human genitalia of a superhero affected by
the substance, situation, context, producing the superpower? Save for
fanzines and dark webs, these questions are not answered by mainstream
comics. Instead, we get the usual line about being a good family man:</p>

	<a

alt="graphixia-212-2" width="499" height="262" class="aligncenter size-full
wp-image-4449" /></a>

	<p>Of course, being a &#8220;full-time husband to Mary Jane&#8221; means
a lot of things, including boinking. Despite apparently leaving Spiderman the
superhero behind, one assumes that the superpowers remain. This great
write-up on <a
href="http://animals.howstuffworks.com/arachnids/spider8.htm">spider sex</a>
gives us this fascinating tidbit: &#8220;spiders don&#8217;t mate by coupling
[...] organs. Instead, the male deposits some sperm onto a small web and
picks it up on the end of his pedipalps. When the female is in position, the
male deposits the sperm in the female&#8217;s genital opening.&#8221; Alright
then. So, how much of the spider&#8217;s characteristics transferred into
Peter Parker and what kind of kinky play is Mary Jane into? Then
there&#8217;s this: a spider&#8217;s &#8220;reproductive organs are at the
rear of the abdomen.&#8221; So where exactly is Peter Parker&#8217;s dick? It
puts a whole new spin on how his costume would actually have to look
doesn&#8217;t it. </p>

[/caption]

	<p>Think about the Fantastic Four&#8217;s genitalia for a second. Try to
unsee Mr. Fantastic&#8217;s snaking member as it stretches, twists, twirls
and elongates who knows where and when. Does Reed Richards have spontaneous
erections? While the comic concentrates on his superior intelligence, perhaps
his moniker belies another source of his fame&#8211;both parts of his name
(Reed and Richards (&#8220;Dicks&#8221;)) are penisy. Then, does the Human
Torch&#8217;s member actually flare up? Because that could be problematic.
Both of these thought exercises are tame when we think about how the
invisible woman&#8217;s genitalia could actually be hidden or
invisible&#8211;so many lousy metaphors for women&#8217;s body parts and
here&#8217;s yet another one&#8211;keep it clean and hidden ladies, please.
The men and can flare up and flop it out, but please, ladies, keep yours
invisible.</p>

	[caption id="attachment_4451" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a

alt="So many women, so little Thing." width="600" height="461"
class="size-full wp-image-4451" /></a> So many women, so little
Thing.[/caption]

	<p>Which brings me to The Thing&#8211;a better name for this discussion
there could not be. What in crap holy hell does his junk look like? Or the
Hulk? ("Is that a zucchini poking out of your ripped pants or are you just
really really angry? I might make you angry; I like you're when your
angry..." [eyebrow raise]). Keep in mind, all these superheroes have sexual
relationships. Reed and Sue have a child, so we know they&#8217;ve had sex.
And we&#8217;re not supposed to think about how that all goes down? Superman
and Wonder Woman! What&#8217;s that like? Then there&#8217;s the bestiality:
Batman and Catwoman, Hawkman and Hawkgirl, Black Canary and Green Arrow; I
don&#8217;t even want to know what happens when Wolverine gets an erection.
</p>

	[caption id="attachment_4452" align="aligncenter" width="710"]<a

width="710" height="364" class="size-full wp-image-4452" /></a> Have sex.
Send kid away. Have more sex! This is one kinky foursome. [/caption]

	<p>I bring all this up because it&#8217;s fun and it raises questions
about representation. I&#8217;m not that interested in how what I&#8217;m
talking about brings up questions around insecurity with human genitalia,
morality discussions, or the way comics &#8220;educate&#8221; young people
about sexual activities and courtship. But just because I&#8217;m not
interested doesn&#8217;t mean these questions aren&#8217;t important. Maybe
The Thing is a representation of herpes at its worst, as an unjustifiable
representation of societal stigma; maybe the Human Torch is the embodiment of
the &#8220;burning pain&#8221; of syphillus. Reed Richards the product of
runaway sexual experimentation&#8211;&#8220;it&#8217;s gonna fall off if you
keep playing with it!&#8221; and Sue, well, she&#8217;s what happens when
you&#8217;re a woman thinking about having sex, or having sex, or being
sexual, or being human. There are some real ethical questions raised by how
mainstream superhero comics represent the surfaces of sexual relationships,
but rarely the actions and never the naked genitalia required to participate
equally in an exchanged-based sexual relationship. All Batman wants to do is
kiss Catwoman&#8230; right. </p>

	<p>Thinking about sexual situations through a human reality that collides
with the inhuman characteristics of superheroes sometimes reveals the shallow
surfaces of our culture. It renders inert the moral curtain that shields the
procreative or purely pleasurable act from view. At the same time, it hints
at the rich fantasy world underlying the surface fantasies of being a
superhero. In an increasingly inhuman world, we have to ask: how the hell
would Superman fuck? </p>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Because I'm an adult
human with adult human tastes, I've recently been rereading the
four-issue <em>Fraggle Rock</em> comic arc, "Journey to the Everspring," by
Kate Leth and Jake Myler. It's not the only Fraggle comic out there, but it's
the most recent reimagining of the characters, and it does something handily
in keeping with the theme of this month's Graphixia posts: it largely
erases the human characters.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/fraggle1.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter wp-image-4462"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/fraggle1.jpg"
alt="fraggle1" width="400" height="615" /></a>

	If you're unfamiliar with the <em>Fraggle Rock</em> IP (and are you
kidding me right now), Fraggles are playful beings that live under the human
world; in turn, they share their ecosystem with worker beings called Doozers,
a giant blues-singing trash heap, and some questionable ogres. The Fraggles
have adventures and learn about philosophy and do all the great things
characters in well-made children's television do. It's a Jim Henson property,
there's <a
href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/joseph-gordon-levitt-star-
produce-783098">a movie coming out starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt</a>, and it
has serious comics chops having been co-written by Canadian experimental poet
and comics/poetry frontiersman <a

	I hope you didn't need that explanation. Also, watch this:

	[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMwiIBueWxc[/embed]

	Anyway, I'm reading the Leth and Myler comic, and I'm interested in a
choice they've made. One key aspect of the Fraggles is that they are never
really interact with people. Though they live under the workshop of Doc and
his dog Sprocket (or the lighthouse of the Captain, if you watched in
Britain), humans are part of a world called "Outer Space." Uncle Travelling
Matt is exploring this world and sending back his dispatches, but humans are
strange -- "silly creatures," Matt calls them -- and don't really register
for most of the Fraggles. Indeed, for good reason: Doc is foolish and
unobservant, and the Captain is kind of mean.

	The humans are never present within the world of the Fraggles, but in the
television version humans always frame the narrative; Doc and Sprocket open
and close each episode, and Matt's adventures with the humans are a key part
of the rhythm of every show. The contrast is always made between the "silly
creatures" and the mistakes they make through their foolishness and folly and
the Fraggles who are always striving to be better stewards of their
environment and to fulfill their role in their ecosystem. Time and time again
in the series, the message underscored is that the Fraggle way -- to dance
your cares away, to let the music play -- is the better, more harmonious way
to live.

	Embrace your inner Fraggle.

	In the Leth/Myler comic, though, humans are never seen at all. They are
the unequivocal villains of the story, the "silly creatures" who have
polluted the Everspring, damming the spring with their garbage and filling
the water with trash. But we never see them. In earlier comics, like the 2010
digest-style comic, Doc and Sprocket, and Matt's interactions with humans,
are interspersed through the Fraggle stories to maintain the through line and
contrast. Here, though, the absence of human characters changes them from
bumbling oafs to hard-hearted villains; what Leth/Myler lose in not having
the contrast between the humans and the non-humans (who do life better) they
gain in the ominousness of the never-explained "silly creatures" who haven't
just bumbled, but have almost killed off all Fraggles and Doozers with their
polluting ways. By keeping the humans off-panel, somewhere where we can't see
them or understand their motivations, all that is left is their cruelty.

	We don't need a visual representation of the contrast between human and
inhuman here to see that the inhuman characters are imbued with far more
humanity. As the Fraggles and two sets of Doozers work together to repair the
damage done by the unseen "silly creatures," the message is reinforced.

	Two legs bad. Felt legs better.]]></content:encoded>

src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/superman-1-300x225.
jpg" alt="superman-1" width="300" height="225" /></a>Inhumanity in comics was
an early staple of the medium, right from Superman in <em>Action</em> #1
asking us to suspend our realities so as to admit a hero who could transgress
the physical, mortal boundaries of how one could make the world a better,
safer and more rational place through dangerous altruistic acts. Prior to his
arrival, readers were used to the pulp heroes of the Phantom, the Shadow,
Sherlock Holmes and Doc Savage who, for all intents and purposes, were really
only highly skilled people doing their best to fight inequity against
difficult odds. Superman was a giant leap outside the box in terms of how we
approached heroism, and it’s no surprise that he came along when he did, as a
response to the extreme environment of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century and
the fracture that it represented in terms of people’s worldviews – coming out
of a Great War, the excess of the roaring 20’s and the Great Depression, the
only figure capable of addressing these previously unimaginable, in reality
inhuman conditions was someone inhuman himself. I’ve argued on Graphixia and
elsewhere that comics’ heroism, the creation and popularization of particular
heroes with particular powers, is always a response to the cultural moment in
which it arises. It says a lot about our society, for good or otherwise, that
we require that our heroes be greater beings than ourselves, both physically
and morally. The rise and predominance of the inhuman or superhuman in comics
directly parallels our increasing inability to interpret our world in a
reasonable, rational way. As our world gets stranger and less comprehensible,
our heroes have to as well, if only purely as a coping mechanism.

	In doing so, however, comics necessarily presents the inhuman as
generally humanoid and mentally digestible, at least enough to relate to on a
physiological level (Brenna’s Fraggles notwithstanding). Most of the
non-human nature of the inhumanity, even when expressing mutants or aliens,
has to be reconciled by our need to identify with those who are there to save
us – our heroes can be inhuman, but only to the degree that we can still
imagine ourselves becoming them. Similarly, our threats have to be imagined
in the same way. One can think of Galactus as an example here, one of comics’
best known villains and an eater of worlds, presented by Stan Lee and Jack
Kirby as being a larger than life sized alien sent to destroy Earth in the
now-classic <em>Fantastic Four</em> 48 (which, on a sidenote, I own – haha),
but importantly still drawn as a humanoid in a costume. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/surfer9.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4468"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/surfer9-300x209.jpg"
alt="surfer9" width="300" height="209" /></a>It’s interesting to note that
when the industry rebooted Galactus for film in <em>Fantastic Four: Rise of
the Silver Surfer</em> and presented him in a <em>truly</em> inhuman way, as
a cloud-like creature full of electricity coming to devour the Earth, the
concept was a flop and the film overall considered a failure, resulting in
some very funny responses as backlash, <a
href="http://gaygamer.net/2007/06/feature_rise_of_the_silver_sur.html">one of
which</a> this attached image is from. Green Lantern saw the same problem in
its film (also generally considered a failure) attempting to portray its key
antagonist Parallax as an abstract entity rather than a humanoid villain.
Comics as a medium, however, rarely gets the formula wrong. From DC’s
Anti-Monitor to Marvel’s <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GALACTUS_VS_PARALLAX
.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4467"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GALACTUS_VS_PARALLAX-
300x250.png" alt="GALACTUS_VS_PARALLAX" width="300" height="250" /></a>Chaos
and Order, we are presented with even the largest and most inhuman of
characters as still being relatable: inhuman yet not, always only just
removed from the scope of our experiences.

	We like our inhumanity then, but only insomuch as we can use it to
rationalize our worlds – there’s only a certain extent to which inhumanity is
allowed to exist in comics if it’s to be successful. Neil Gaiman does an
excellent job of exemplifying this in Sandman, in which abstract concepts
such as Dream, Desire and Despair are given human form so that we can cope
with, interact with and understand them – anything other than this kind of
presentation would ultimately only serve to make the concepts even more
obscure and less engaging. Inhumanity in comics serves a twofold and almost
paradoxical purpose in pulling us closer to ideas of, say, good and evil,
while at the same time pushing them further away by showing us how they’re
ultimately beyond anything a mere human is capable of achieving. There are
exceptions to these, however, in some characters such as Batman and Hawkeye,
but these are by and large the exceptions and are still presented as
unattainable ideals; they may actually be human, but even in the way that
they are drawn they are normally depicted as being outside the bounds of what
it means to be a regular person.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heroes-
e1441771692779.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-4470 alignright"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heroes-e1441771692779
.jpg" alt="heroes" width="600" height="311" /></a>We engage with the inhuman
heroes and villains in comics in the same way that we engage with all science
fiction: allowing ourselves the means through which we can compartmentalize
the concerns which are beyond our abilities to understand, all the while
creating heroes as well to deal with these problems. And the more challenging
our world becomes, the more we need these ideas in order to keep ourselves
going. We see this in other areas of popular culture in conspiracy theories
that concoct networks of organizations of villains restraining the social
classes; in secret government agendas that control our lives; in celebrity
idolatry (arguably inhumans in their own right); in unifying, oversimplified
concepts like “cancer” that acts as placeholders for a vast array of
biological mutations. We have an instinctual desire to ensure that we have
our world rationalized, quarantined and manageable, and we cling desperately
to the illusion that the most terrifying threats to ourselves and our world
are able to be overcome solely through our ability to contain them in the
simplifying process of naming them. The advent and prevalence of the inhuman
in comics (and really in entertainment media in general) is a direct response
to our growing awe and fear in a globally connected and better informed
world, and we turn to it for the relief that it provides in collapsing that
which is overwhelming spiritually, morally and physically; it’s little wonder
that we take such satisfaction in seeing our favorite superheroes die and
then consistently come back from the dead in an increasingly atheist world.
But if this sounds like a negative portrayal of superheroes, it isn’t meant
to be. By hyperbolizing the human and by allowing us access to it by
restricting the forms in which it can be portrayed, comics offers an avenue
through which we can wrestle with concepts bigger than ourselves. Even if we
ultimately can’t reconcile our wonder through our inhuman heroes and
villains, they still create the framework by which we can challenge the most
terrifyingly, overwhelmingly base aspects of what it means to be
human.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span
style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a

=247" target="_blank">The Motherless Oven</a></span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> (2014) Rob Davis presents a vivid fantasy world
where the human and inhuman live side by side. However, he imbues the world
with a sense of the everyday in keeping with a long history of British Social
Realism. The three teenagers at the heart of the story are all human but
their parents are a strange inhuman mix of sculptures, murals, monsters, and
mechanical objects. Not only that but they have been constructed by the
children themselves.</span>

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">The basic plot about three
adolescents who run away from school to go on a quest to find one of their
dads (who may have been kidnapped) sounds fairly straightforward, but from
the very first page it is obvious that we are not in Kansas anymore. An odd
circular object with dials and spikes, looking like a steampunk sun
sculpture, announces that it is “knife o’clock.” Below it the narration text
says “So I chained up my dad in the shed.” The next page shows a dark sky
filled with kitchen knives that are plunging to the ground like rain, pouring
down on a row of suburban houses. This, it seems, is a perfectly normal turn
of events. We are then introduced to the main character Scarper Lee who is
watching the “rain” from his window </span>

2014.[/caption]

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">Scarper is a moody teenager but he has
more reason than most to be temperamental–he knows that he will die in three
weeks time. In this universe people know their death day but not when they
were born. Davis also introduces an ingenious narrative device; a vase next
to Scarper starts voicing his thoughts, we see speech bubbles emanating from
its long neck.This is a “home gazette,” given to Scarper by the school nurse
to record his thoughts and help him in his dying days like some sort of
ceramic therapist. It also helps the reader (and other characters) know what
is going on.</span>

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">The only person crazy enough to go out in
a knifestorm is the mysterious new girl in school Vera Pike. She turns up at
Scarper’s house carrying a cafe table over her shoulder, its thick round top
acting as an umbrella protecting her from the deluge of sharp blades. Vera
barges into Scarper’s life, sitting next to him in class and waiting at his
front gate to walk him to school. She also befriends Curtis Smith in the
“Deaf Unit,” the part of the school were kids with “needs” are sent. Curtis
has “Medicated Interference Syndrome” which seems to be some sort of autistic
spectrum disorder. To help him cope he carries around some sort of
retro-futuristic ipod that has a dial to modify his “signal to noise.” If
turned up too high his nose starts to bleed and his dialogue turns into a
messily drawn stream of consciousness. This newly-formed gang soon escape
from school (past the guard lions obviously) to search for Scaper’s dad. We
never see Mr Lee in his entirety but he appears to be a large boat on wheels
festooned in various brass pipes and horns. He was kept chained in the shed
and is wife is a hairdryer. <em>The Motherless Oven</em> has its genesis in
an earlier short story <em><a
href="http://dinlos.blogspot.co.uk/2010/11/observercape-graphic-short-story-
prize.html" target="_blank">How I Built My Father</a></em> (2009).</span>

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">Davis likes playing with words as much as
he enjoys drawing the story. Try saying Scarper Lee, Vera Pike and Curtis
Smith out loud and feel the syllables tumbling around in your mouth. He also
makes much of words with double meanings. When Scarper’s friend Pete’s mum
has a breakdown she is emotionally bereft and lying in the school playground
but because she is also a machine she has mechanically failed and can’t be
fixed. Later Vera tears the legs off another pupil’s mum who is a paper mural
pasted up on the school wall. Wondering whether she will die someone replies
“I reckon. Mother paper bleeds really bad.” </span>

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another interesting aspect to the book is
the way that gangs are presented like pop groups and, instead of newspapers,
posters on bus shelters give out the news. After a run in with another gang,
Orson and the Morons, locals are warned about the exploits of the lead
characters with a poster calling them Vera Pike and The Heels “The hottest
new band on the estate.” When another band releases something it isn’t a
record but someone’s mother into the sky like a balloon. Intriguingly Davis
does also depict vinyl records, Scarper has one on his wall and there appears
to be a record shop in town. Circles, wheels and spheres are a recurring
motif throughout the book. At school one of the lessons is “Circular History”
where “God creates Man and Man creates God” and one of Scarper’s textbooks is
“The Four Cycles of Life: A Practical Guide to Gods, Immortals, Women and the
Sea.”</span>

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">Davis has created a complete world with
its own natural laws and consistencies. The person who recommended the book
to me suggested it was similar to <a
href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/13/100-best-novels-clockwork-
orange-anthony-burgess" target="_blank"><em>A </em></a></span><a
href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/13/100-best-novels-clockwork-
orange-anthony-burgess" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Clockwork Orange</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (1962)
by Anthony Burgess in the way it depicted a distinct world. Even with all the
fantastical elements in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The
Motherless Oven</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it is still rooted
in the everyday world of teenagers–parents, school, music and friendship all
being important in different ways. Davis’ earlier work on </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/01/22/151-notes-on-nelson/"
target="_blank">Nelson</a></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2011)
and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a
href="http://www.selfmadehero.com/title.php?isbn=9781906838652&amp;edition_id
=218" target="_blank">Don Quixote</a></span></i><span style="font-weight:
400;"> (2013) was more cartoony and colourful but here the art is subdued
with its thick black ink and grey washes. Davis was attempting to keep the
story grounded and in an <a
href="http://ap2hyc.com/2015/02/interview-rob-davies-author-of-the-motherless
-oven/" target="_blank">interview</a> he acknowledged the influence of
British kitchen sink films of the 1960s “I felt that a black and white world
would bind the ordinary and the fantastical together and give it a stark
reality.” </span>

	Films like <i><a href="http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6b513f84"
target="_blank">Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</a></i> (1960) by Karel
Reisz came out of the documentary movement of the the 1930s and were
depicting real working class lives on the screen for the first time. This
wave of social-realist dramas would later lead to TV shows like <i><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-ATrUuBHRs" target="_blank">Grange
Hill</a> </i>(with its comic book style opening titles) surely another
influence on <i>The Motherless Oven </i>along with British comic strips such
as <i><a href="https://www.beano.com/character/the-bash-street-kids/"
target="_blank">The Bash Street Kids</a></i> in <i>The Beano</i>. Davis
discussed his influences in an interview <a
href="http://www.brokenfrontier.com/rob-davis-motherless-oven-selfmadehero/"
target="_blank">Broken Frontier</a> and they run wider than these. Some such
as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16391857"
target="_blank">Ronald Searle</a>’s illustrations and <a
href="http://barbarahepworth.org.uk/" target="_blank">Barbara Hepworth</a>’s
sculpture made complete sense–many of the parents look like a piece of
Hepworth’s work. Other influences such as <a
href="http://zoranealehurston.com/" target="_blank">Zora Neale Hurston</a>,
seem less obvious but no less intriguing and perhaps hint to finding out more
about Vera Pike in later volumes. <i>The Motherless Oven</i> is mooted to be
the first in a trilogy. It would be fascinating to see how Davis broadens the
world he has created. I hope he continues to resist the urge to explain
everything in it.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[James Kochalka’s<i>
American Elf</i> (RIP) is undoubtedly one of the most prominent comic strips
in contemporary American Autobiographical Comics, and one which set the tone
for many diary strips and webcomics that would follow. Its authenticity is
rarely, if ever, doubted by its readership or by critics and scholars.
However, there is a slight visual aspect of his comics that might trouble a
reading of his comics as authentically and fully autobiographical, which is
that he draws himself as an elf, and his friends and family as a variety of
animals including birds, frogs and dogs.

	I’ve never actually known anyone who really reads comics to question why
Kochalka draws himself as an elf, but I did once show <i>American Elf</i> to
a friend who wasn’t into comics who couldn’t quite understand why Kochalka
had drawn himself as an elf, and really wanted to work it out. I wasn’t much
use at the time, but it did get me thinking, and when considering the notions
of humanity and inhumanity for this post, Kochalka’s little elf-ears were the
first thing that popped into my head. So I thought I’d force myself to
consider the whys, and the ins and outs, of Kochalka’s choice to steer just
slightly away from humanity in depicting his own life.

	<i>American Elf</i> always approached and presented Kochalka’s life with
a sense of play, both in the textual and visual aspects of the narrative,
during its 14-year run as a daily diary webcomic. Particularly obviously, his
fluid and uncomplex but still skilful visual style, defined by the contours
of ink and brush, gives a vivid and simple portrait of his life and its
quotidian elements that has a quality of lightness to it, which would not be
achieved from the rigid lines of an ink pen. His lines suit the drawing of
elves, toads and dogs more than they suit the drawing of human figures, and
throughout the reading of <em>American Elf</em> an expectation develops of
such playfulness and inhuman, slightly carnivalesque comedy.

	Kochalka also attempts philosophy, however, and is not afraid to grapple
with big themes, as in the above example, where he moves from bad pizza
straight into abject nihilism in four panels. The contrast between the
softness of his cartooning and the final words his elf avatar says is, of
course, ironic and funny. It would be whether he had the elf ears or not, but
the elf ears heighten this irony and humour slightly just by being there - by
placing another slight distance between the comic world and the real world,
the message becomes all the more prominent and all the more ironic. Elf ears
or no elf ears, the comic also remains autobiographical. The slight distance
from humanity again just helps to drive the narrative.

	Much more significant is Kochalka’s own attempts to, in his own words,
“learn something about the human condition.” In <a
href="http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2012/12/robot-6-qa-james-kochalka-
on-the-end-of-american-elf/">an interview with Robot 6</a> about his decision
to stop drawing <i>American Elf </i>at the end of 2012, Kochalka answered a
question about his approach to autobiographical cartooning thus: <p
style="padding-left: 30px">“I don’t think I ever changed events to make the
strip better, but I did do selective editing and condensing. Possibly
occasional exaggeration? Sometimes people who were actually there would argue
with me about how I portrayed certain events. It’s possible that I’m the
classic unreliable narrator. <i>I consider the work to be non-fiction, but I
would have no particular qualms with it being labeled fiction.</i> Certainly
my cat can’t talk, but I’ve drawn the cat talking on more than one occasion.
But if the strip is fiction then in some weird way my actual life is fiction.
It’s a bit strange!” [italics added by author]</p> Kochalka’s cat Spandy, who
could never be human, became a regular fixture in <i>American Elf </i>and
offered many sage thoughts that went largely unheard by the other characters
in <em>American Elf</em>. I think this, the imagery of pertinent sounds
falling on deaf ears, also says something about the human condition. But it
can’t do so without the inhuman cat as its conduit, so once again the
inhumanity carries the humanity.

	I found just one example of a comic in which Kochalka drew himself as a
human whilst re-reading my Kochalka collection for this post (which,
incidentally, was so enjoyable that I’m now re-reading <i>American Elf</i> in
full from start to finish). Kochalka’s 2005 book <i>The Cute Manifesto</i>
collects some of his more philosophical and polemical comics and prose
essays, including the infamous “Craft is the Enemy” post that led to <a
href="http://www.tcj.com/blood-and-thunder-craft-is-the-enemy/">this lengthy
debate</a> over at <i>The Comics Journal</i>. One of these comics is called
“Sunburn,” and it feels flat, serious, forlorn and solemn as it takes the
reader through a number of contemplations about his body, which he can “never
escape.” In <i>American Elf</i>, however, he does escape his body through his
art, and through the interplay between the humanity and inhumanity of drawing
himself as a humanoid elf going about his daily life. In contrast to the
stern depictions of realistic humanity in “Sunburn,” <i>American Elf
</i>feels much lighter, more playful and a more enjoyable and engaging read,
precisely because of its slight elements of inhumanity and how they augment
the narrative.

	Looking at Kochalka’s autobiographical comics as a whole, the inhumanity
doesn’t really matter that much apart from where it serves the narrative, and
it doesn’t affect the classification of Kochalka’s comics as
autobiographical. Autobiography is a fluid notion, perhaps more so in comics
than any other narrative art form, and might be seen as a continuum or nexus,
within which notions of humanity and inhumanity can interact for effect and
for the purposes of narrative drive and personal expression, as they do in
Kochalka’s comics. The nature of representation in art is such that reality
can never be depicted with absolute verisimilitude, nor should it attempt to
do so - as Kochalka says in “Reinventing Everything,” also in <i>The Cute
Manifesto</i>, “even the most complicated work of art is a vast
oversimplification of the actual world in which we live.” So when the
question arose of why James Kochalka draws himself as an elf, or why such and
such characters in a comic are drawn as animals, my answer was “why not?” and
it will remain the same should the question be asked again.

	The inhumanity present in Kochalka’s comics might not be as overt as some
presented in the <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2015/08/26/212-having-sex-with-animals-
the-inhuman-world-of-superhero-relationships/">other posts</a> in this
series, but as the above comparison between his comics shows, it makes a big
difference, and demonstrates that comics have a unique ability to present a
visually enhanced and augmented world for specific narrative effect, however
pronounced or unpronounced such enhancements might be. If I may <a
href="https://twitter.com/paddyjohnston/status/623397679524126720">bastardise
Ted Leo</a> for a second, a little inhumanity goes a mighty long
way.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

<title>#217 Inhuman Storytelling? Notes on Vaughn-James&#039;s The
Cage</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

	Storytelling is often said to be one of the most distinctively human
activities. Cognitive interests in narrative often suggest that we basically
seek out stories as a pleasure and even a kind of training for the stories we
constantly imagine about ourselves and others in our everyday lives. And this
view on narrative and the self has largely fed into the contemporary doxa. So
far, the previous posts have focused on comics with recognizable characters,
but reconfiguring notions of humanity and inhumanity. They challenge their
readers by questions notions of the human body and participate in this
increasingly relevant “post-human condition,” to use Robert Pepperell's
phrase. But what does it feel like to read narratives without humans, not
even anthropomorphized animals, robots, monsters, or elves? This is of course
a question that all ‘abstract comics’ ask, but instead of looking directly at
this kind of works, I'll focus on a comic that does border on abstraction,
Martin Vaughn-James's <em>The Cage</em>, and which plays more consciously
with the idea of characters, humanity and non-humanity.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-001.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4514"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-001.png"
alt="Image 001" width="261" height="359" /></a>

	First printed in Montreal in 1975, <em>The Cage </em>is something of an
oddball in the history of comics – kind of one of those <a
href="http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/1970sgraphicnovels/2014/11/12/the-projector/"
>1970s graphic novels</a>. Mostly written and drawn in Paris, the book is
deeply influenced by the French Nouveau Roman and related trends in cinema;
one of the main influences is Resnais' <em>L'Année dernière à Marienbad</em>,
based on a script by Alain Robbe-Grillet. Vaughn-James quickly achieved a
cult status in Europe, through the reprints of Les Impressions Nouvelles and
Thierry Groensteen's essay <em>La Construction de la cage</em>, but the book
had to wait several decades before Coach House finally reprinted it two years
ago.

	There are <a
href="http://www.comicforschung.uni-bonn.de/index.php?action=
list_QUICKSEARCH_CORE">many brilliant essays</a> about <em>The Cage</em>, so
I am not hoping to bring anything new to that exegesis here, but what's
interesting about <em>The Cage </em>in the context of this series on
in/humanity is precisely that the narrative hones this tension between the
absence of actual human figures and the human traces that crop up throughout
the book. The most striking aspect of the book is, of course, the complete
<em>absence </em>of characters, undermining the key role of the protagonist
as a historical mainstay of comics storytelling and its cultural industry.
And, as is already known, <em>The Cage </em>does not tell a proper story but
engrosses its reader-spectators into a dynamic sequence of morphing images.
Visually, the cinematic influence is clear, but the book remains irrevocably
grounded in a rigorous double-page composition of two contiguous panels
facing each other. It is this rhythmic regularity that provides the ‘beat’
structuring this flow of images (and I am evoking here <a
href="https://books.google.ca/books?hl=fr&amp;id=e30lDoXRe_cC&amp;q=beat#v=
snippet&amp;q=beat&amp;f=false">Groensteen's ideas on the rhythms of
comics</a>).

	In this way, the visual sequence takes on a machine-like,
self-engendering dynamic, strengthened by the captions describing precisely
this logic and linking it to the workings of a machine. In his 2006 preface,
Martin Vaughn-James incidentally describes the making of the book as the
search for a “generator” of images to fill in his blank pages, a
Frankenstein-inspired machine that somehow becomes estranged from its creator
(who describes himself as an “author orphaned by his own creation”). To quote
only the most speaking passages:

	&nbsp; <blockquote>Blank pages demand to be filled, especially by someone
who suffers from chronic <em>horreur du vide</em>. To fill them I needed some
kind of generator that could produce atemporal, self-accumulating images that
would roll like snowballs and rise like house of cards. I borrowed the facade
of an electric pumping station for my ‘image generator’ […] and invented a
sort of infernal spinning piano-roll to produce my ‘voice-over’
text.</blockquote> &nbsp;

	Even the narrating voice of the text, cannot be led back to a distinct
subjective agent that would give the visual sequence a ‘human’ grounding (and
indeed, there is a nearly erratic discrepancy between image and text), but
emerges from an “infernal spinning piano-roll” – the crazed, repetitive
ramblings of another mechanical device. This mechanical unfurling of the book
that Vaughn-James describes is further intimately connected to this
disappearance of the character, which he pictures as a conscious act of
murder:

	&nbsp; <blockquote>[…] Fuelled by the basically simple idea of murdering
the ‘character’ and of recreating or disposing of the evidence, the engine is
cranked up and set in motion. It plunges forward and backward through space
and time, consuming its own tail (or tale), spitting out pages and pictures
in ever more complex combinations […] (Vaughn-James, 11).

	&nbsp;</blockquote> And so, the drawings successively take us across
various places: desert landscapes, a Mesoamerican pyramid, several rooms, an
electric pumping station, a museum, downtown streets, a cage, and so on. All
places devoid of human figures. But if there are no human or
anthropomorphized characters (functioning as actants in the narrative),
humans are not completely absent from the book. On the contrary, the book is
replete with traces, leftovers of human activity. In this sense, it is no
wonder that one of the first images of such human presence is an Aztec
pyramid. For the rest, there are all sorts of buildings and constructions,
clothes, objects, a bed, headphones, goggles, ropes, recording machines, and
so on. These objects take shapes that occasionally bring us indeed very close
to a human shape – evoking precisely the moment of its murdering. These hints
and details function as signposts of the character's disappearance: they are
precisely <em>traces</em>, marks that simultaneously indicate presence and
absence. And of course, these traces echo the act of drawing and inking: the
flying sheets of paper, the black blots, the frames all indicate a <em>mise
en abyme </em>of the act of creation (see <a
href="http://revue-textimage.com/06_image_recit/latxague1.html">Claire
Latxague's article</a>). As such, they remind us of the humanity behind these
pages, of the ‘hand’ that we read in the drawings, the physical marks left by
the author. But these ‘human’ drawings are caught up in a logic that exceeds
them, that reaches beyond, out of their control, get caught up in their own
dynamic: images that have lives of their own.

	&nbsp;

	“Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.” ―
Mary W. Shelley, <span id="quote_book_link_18487"> <i> Frankenstein,
</i>1818. </span>

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Originally serialised in <em>Judge Dredd Megazine</em> 1.11 - 1.17 from
August 1991, "Raptaur" (script Alan Grant, Art Dean Ormston, letters Tom
Frame) should be considered a classic of British science fiction comics, and
an essential story within the Dredd/<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_AD_%28comics%29"
target="_blank"><em>2000 A.D.</em></a> corpus.

	It remains inexplicable to me what the reasons are for the paucity of
scholarly research on the extensive body of Dredd comics, particularly by
sociologists and political scientists but also by self-defined "comics
studies" colleagues.  Is there such prejudice against British comics, or
science fiction, or comics in general? Specifically, "Raptaur" seems to me to
be one of several clear examples of the complex themes and motifs Judge Dredd
stories have explored since 1977, ambiguously portraying and commenting on,
with varying levels of success, transparency and allegory,  everyday life in
the United Kingdom.

	The output by writer Alan Grant is frankly overwhelming and a true feat
of discipline, passion and determination, and it remains impossible to
attempt any generalised assessment of his work. "Raptaur" is to me an example
of his finest craftmanship, perhaps in this case exponentially embelished by
the sophistication of Dean Ormston's colourful artwork, characterised in this
story by juxtaposing thickly and shakily-bordered rectangular panels over
full-page panels depicting cityscapes or hectic, monstruous action.

	As it's common with many if not almost all Dredd/<em>2000
A.D </em>stories, "Raptaur" very clearly borrows (to put it politely) visual
and plot motifs from all over the place.  <em>Alien</em> (Scott, 1977), 
<em>Predator </em>(McTiernan, 1987) and the original<em> Star Wars</em> films
predate this story, not to mention of course  Shelley's <em>Frankenstein
</em>(1818), Stevenson's<em> Olalla</em> (1885) and <em>Jekyll and Mr Hyde
</em>(1886) (these last two references would be further explored by Alan
Grant in "Raptaur Returns" in 1995).

	The presence of  'alien' (i.e. extra-terrestrial) life in Mega City One
is always taken for granted. The Raptaur is one of those aliens, which in the
cover of <em>Judge Dredd Megazine.</em> 1.11, August 1991, containing its
first appearance, is decribed as an "alien perp"- a perpetrator, a "creep" in
Dredd lingo. The Raptaur looks strikingly like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom_(comics)"
target="_blank">Venom</a>, particularly the eyes and mouth, if not in
McFlarlane's 1988 depiction certainly in those by other artists later on. The
Raptaur feeds on human brains, and can create a "psi-fog" that disorients its
victims. It also secretes a toxin that lowers its preys' resistance. With the
Raptaur, inhuman alien predator, Judge Dredd finds his match, and in this
story, it seems, Dredd finds his humanity too.

	&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: center;">A selection of passages from Raptaur (Grant,
Ormston and Frame, 1991). These images sourced from Alien Nations, Judge
Dredd. The Mega Collection © 2015 Hachette Patchworks Ltd.</p> "Raptaur" is
to me a paradigmatic piece of the Dredd corpus because it clearly depicts the
political ambiguity of its fictional universe. Judge Dredd is "The Law" in a
totalitarian, repressive dystopian megalopolis. He is accountable to almost
no one, and the reader is permanently banned from seeing him without his
helmet, even when he lies naked on the operating room, because seeing his
face would mean confirming he is human. It is the nature of humanity what is
in ongoing interrogation in the Dredd stories, because "The Law" substitues
human rights, and because, paradoxically, only humans could be so hellbent on
a literal application of "The Law".

	Furthermore Dredd readers are by default in the uncomfortable position to
identify with Dredd as the protagonist of its story, its city and its
universe. The alien -- that most British and contemporary of fears -- is a
mortal threat, and only Dredd and the judges can save us. The Raptaur as the
alien is primitive, deprived of verbal language, and a criminal by
definition. Deprived of human reason, it feeds on brains, and has
psychological ("psi") abilities that defeat the psi judge called for back up.
As with many Dredd stories "Raptaur" is narrated also with the counterpoint
of a techno-mediatic voice, in this case a radio "on the beat" reporter, that
documents the proceedings, offering an alternative yet also clearly
institutional, official view which is not Dredd's, but that belongs to the
techno-system of surveillance and repression lived in Mega City One.

	This is the ambiguous identity of Judge Dredd as a character and of the
Dredd comics as cultural products. Is Dredd human or inhuman? His humanity is
starkly demonstrated in this story, not only by contrasting him with the
Raptour as the inhuman alien, but through clever rhetorical devices in
dialogue and visual perspective, placing the reader in the place of Dredd and
seeing him become human by almost dying and surviving. There is plenty of
humour, not just 'black humour', but downright silly humour, which again
makes any attempt at placing Dredd on one clear 'side' extremely difficult.

	Ideologically, this ambiguity can be unsettling, but remains profoundly
interesting: is Mega City One an allegory of the modern city, particularly
London (but often, also confunsingly, closer aesthetically to New York), and
Dredd a symbol of right-wing totalitarian regimes, and the extraterrestrial
aliens a way of referring to contemporary anxieties about immigration, where
the alien means threat, violence, poverty and crime? If so why is it so easy
to identify, at least in this story, with a dying, almost sensitive Judge
Dredd, who defeats Death itself to get up and fulfill his mission, even
against doctor's orders? It's not either/or, and there are no easy answers.

	I have been rereading the works of French philosopher Étienne Balibar,
and I have been particularly interested in his discussion of the concepts of
´politics of the Other Scene’, 'ambiguous identities' and of 'border' in the
European context. In <em>Politics and the Other Scene</em> (2002; translation
2012), Balibar uses the notion of the 'Other Scene' to describe what he sees
as the essential heterogeneity of political processes in comparison with
Freudian psychic processes (‘other scene' is a Freudian term). For Balibar,
‘the other scene of Politics is also the scene of the other’. I wonder if in
a comic like "Raptaur" something like this is at work, in which there is a
politically problematic ambiguity in terms of the identities of the city
itself (Mega City One), the hero/protagonist and the alien/criminal
antagonist. What can we learn from this fictional dystopia and the ambiguous
position in which we are placed as readers, being asked to empathise with
Judge Dredd? We might have to keep writing, and start thinking harder.

	I have spoken here on Graphixia before about how much I am loving Gillen,
McKelvie, Wilson and Cowles’ <em>The Wicked and The Divine</em>. Last month’s
issue, in which they chose to create an issue exclusively using art that had
already appeared elsewhere in the series was a stroke of genius, one that had
me overjoyed. In case you’re not familiar with the book, it is the story of
what would happen if every ninety years 12 humans were transformed into 12
specific deities, and then two years later they die.

	Created, curated and controlled by the mysterious figure of Ananke, these
young people each deal very differently with the responsibility and
expectations of their newfound status and rapidly impending demise. It is
this tension between these figures as young people and their newfound powers
and positions of responsibility that so interests me. As each issue focuses
on a new character and tells us their story, we see how each has sought to
reconcile, or indeed ignore, the conflict between their former lives, hopes
and dreams and their newly acquired pressing awareness of their own
mortality.

	<a

src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/baphomet-300x297.png"
alt="baphomet" width="300" height="297" /></a>

	The twelve gods are all dramatically different, from the cocky Luci, full
of bravado, to the sexist horror that is Woden. However, it was really Issue
13 that got me thinking about the aspect of this story that is the
relationship between these characters as gods and their former selves as
young people. How do they reconcile their rapidly approaching deaths? How do
they cope with their new powers? How do they rationalize (or not) the fame,
adoration and hatred that as accompanied their new status? Issue 13 told the
story of Tara and was a tale of what happened when a shy, fragile young woman
was given unprecendented visibility, and how the unwanted attention took its
toll on her life. Tara is no longer human, but still plagued by the same
issues that she struggled with as a young woman. The abuse that she receives
from the public as a popstar is a horrific extension of the catcalling she is
subjected to when walking down the street as a young woman. The reader is
shown her in conversation with Ananke, pleading with the older woman for some
clarity about who she is and what her purpose is. She pleads with the reader
“I couldn’t be everything you needed me to be… And you saw what happened any
time I tried to be anything else” (p. 20) before entreating them to be “be
kinder”.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screenshot-2015-10-
15-21.34.48.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4551 size-full"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screenshot-2015-10-15

/></a>

	The first arc of the comic, told from the perspective of Laura, a devoted
fan of the Pantheon, neatly demonstrated this divide between the human and
the inhuman as Laura struggled to reconcile the behavior of the gods with her
fandom. Later arcs, as the narrative has focused in on the characters,
stories and histories of the gods themselves, have shown how this opposition
is found within the characters themselves. The tension between human and
inhuman is not only found in the relationship between these deities and their
fans but also in the relationship the pantheon have with their former lives.
Tara’s plea to the reader to “be kinder… You have no idea what people are
going through” weighs heavy on them. This is not simply a story about 12
popstars and their glittering lives but rather a damning indictment on the
deification of popular figures and their role within contemporary society.

	Meanwhile Lucifer (Luci) seemed brash and uncaring, confident and not
bothered by the opinions of others. She is harsh and manipulative, using
Laura to bolster her own self-esteem and indulge her desire to be the centre
of attention at all times. However it is also possible to read her actions as
the bravado of a teenage girl, forced to grow up too soon. She is cocky, but
she has had to be, when not even an adult herself she has been forced to face
the reality of her own rapidly shortened life. This tension isn’t played out
in the stories each of the gods (or at least not yet) some of them, like
Woden, are committed to their inhumanity. But for others, like Cassandra, the
struggle to reconcile their former humanity with their new role,
responsibility and platform is constant.

263x300.png" alt="Badb:Morrigan etc" width="263" height="300" /></a>

	I think that it is this struggle that I find so compelling about this
series. Being a teenager was terrible, being a teenager with knowledge of
your own mortality and the eyes of millions focused on you would be terrible
beyond belief. As the series continues I look forward to seeing how this
central tension between the human and the divine, the human and the inhuman
plays out. Woden might, until now, have been portrayed as a truly despicable
character, but was he always like that? Or was it the impact of sudden
adoration and attention that turned him into the arrogant misogynist we met
in Issue 14? The series has a long way to go and I can’t wait to see how
these stories are woven together to reach a climax.]]></content:encoded>

Becoming Unbecoming</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span
style="font-weight: 400;">My view of the 1970s is affected by the fact that I
associate them with my childhood. While I was born in the early 1960s, I have
no recollection of the Summer of Love or other happenings of that storied
period. My time was the aftermath: Elton John, Supertramp, bell bottoms and
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in the Family</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">. While I have nostalgic feelings towards the
1970s, I have no doubt we were crueller then. Bullying was a fact of life, as
was racism, sexism, and homophobia. And while these things doubtless still
exist, they are no longer simply the accepted status quo. There is such a
thing as progress in social ethics, even though a shrinking but hardening
rump of right wingers yearn for “the good old days” when we didn’t have to
worry about being “politically correct.” </span>

	&nbsp;

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">In any event, I seek out works of art set
in the Seventies because I like to see whether their sense of the zeitgeist
accords with mine. Most of the time it does; the feeling I get, assuredly the
stuff of fantasy, is that in the Seventies shared cultural experience was
possible and that those of us who were around then, whether we grew up in New
York, London, or Vancouver, can relate to each other in a way that seems
impossible now. When I read Jonathan Lethem’s </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Fortress of Solitude</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> and kids are playing skully in the street, I feel
I have an intimate knowledge of it, though I never played it in my life. The
specifics of the game are irrelevant; what matters is the feeling of playing
a game in the street. </span>

	&nbsp;

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">Una’s drawn memoir </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming Unbecoming</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> should evoke similar feelings, as she reflects on
growing up in Leeds in the 1970s. I have more of a connection to Leeds than
Brooklyn, as my parents grew up nearby, and I spent several childhood
vacations in Methley and Pontefract visiting grandparents and other
relatives. But Una made me think of how our experience was not shared and
never could be because of her growing up as a girl subject to the double
standards of attitudes towards girls’ and women’s sexuality. </span>

	&nbsp;

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">Una links her own lived experience to the
search for the Yorkshire Ripper. David Peace's novels in his Red Riding
trilogy make the violence and misogyny of the Yorkshire Ripper simply an
extension of the violence and misogyny in the male-dominated world of
Yorkshire in the 1970s. The police, newspaper men, prostitutes, and people in
general live in a world of </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Clockwork Orange</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> style
ultraviolence. Page after page of it leave the reader battered and numb to
the experience. </span>

	&nbsp;

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">Una makes the same kind of connection in
her graphic memoir: the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper, with its misdirections
and false assumptions on the part of the police, provides the context for
Una's own subjection to sexual assault. But where Peace hits you over the
head, Una draws you in with bemused understatement and subtly symbolic
drawings. As the title itself suggests, </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Becoming Unbecoming</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is both
a reflection on transformation and being and an analysis of how a person, the
author herself, comes to defy a parochial sense of morality and aesthetics.
</span>

	&nbsp;

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">What interests me most about
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming Unbecoming</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> is Una’s use of the comics medium to explore the
past and reflect on its meaning. There's definitely a sense of two strong
communication channels interweaving in </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Becoming Unbecoming</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">:
language and images work together in precise ways. The art is evocative and
expressive, while the writing has a reflective, inquiring quality that gives
the ideas clarity and gravity; it is simple but not simplistic. One of the
arguments for the graphic memoir being a genre of trauma is that images can
compensate for what is fundamentally unsayable. But that’s definitely not the
case here. Una has no difficulty writing what happened to her: her voice is a
powerful element here. </span>

	&nbsp;

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">Any given page offers language and images
working together in elegant counterpoint. For example: </span>

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Meanwhile-I-was-
getting-interested-in-boys.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-4558
aligncenter"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Meanwhile-I-was-
getting-interested-in-boys.png" alt="Una, Becoming Unbecoming, Myriad
Editions, 2015" width="1504" height="1914" /></a>

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">The television report on the search for
the Ripper infiltrates the cozy world of the living room and spills over onto
the second half of the page. No one is in the living room watching or
listening to the report, making it seem as if Una expects the reader to sit
down in one of the chairs. Also linking the two halves of the page, stitching
them together, is the needle and thread in the middle, which does double duty
as a metaphor for the impossibility of finding the Ripper through a 5 pound
note he gave one of his victims. The deadpan tone of “meanwhile I was getting
interested in boys” juxtaposed with the brutality of the television report,
creates a disturbing effect, as does the fact that so many of the children in
the drawing are staring out at us. Even though the image shows some violence,
with one boy appearing to strike another, the teenagers on the schoolground
in their uniforms seem innocent in contrast to the description of the stabbed
prostitute;  they look as if they expect some sort of explanation. This gaze
contrasts curiously with the empty living room: at the beginning of the page
we are looking in--as if peering into a doll house--while at the end, we are
being looked at. The perspectival shifts are clever and implicate the reader
in the scene. Thus a single page of </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Becoming Unbecoming</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> connects
and disrupts the worlds of everyday life, social interaction, and media
sensationalism. What the Ripper is up to is far away and yet he could strike
close to home at any time: the play between distance and proximity echoes the
perspectival shifts. </span>

	&nbsp;

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">Una’s own position is conveyed by her
presenting her adult self’s attempt to interpret her child self’s knowledge
about sex. For example, she says that she did not know what a prostitute was,
and that she was curious about them. While the Una of now understands what a
prostitute is, she maintains the child’s sense of bafflement about the
incomprehensibly contradictory meanings of the word “slut,” its relationship
to prostitution, and its relationship to Una’s own sexuality. </span>

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Im-not-a-slut.png"><
img class="size-full wp-image-4557"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Im-not-a-slut.png"
alt="Una, Becoming Unbecoming, Myriad Editions, 2015" width="1517"
height="1919" /></a>

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here the words travel around the page in
search of answers; they go up and down hills and around roads. The words
themselves “negotiate the landscape” that Una has trouble negotiating with
adults in language. What follows is a verbal and visual deconstruction of the
word “slut.” The word refers to prostitutes who are paid for sex, women who
are enthusiastic about sex, lesbians and so on. The term applies to any woman
in any sexual context, or even just any woman. Indeed, as we follow the words
along the road the images of the women, the one leaning against the
streetlamp and the one smoking, are perhaps suggestive of prostitutes, but
also they could very well be any women, making us ask what the signs of
prostitution or sluttishness are. Does leaning against a streetlamp signal
prostitute? Smoking? Length of dress? The only way for a woman not to be
confused with a slut is to be completely non-sexual. Finally, the word ends
up saying more about its speaker and their attitude towards women than about
the person named by the word. </span>

	&nbsp;

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">The visual correspondence between the
woman in centre of the page, smoking, wearing a short dress, showing cleavage
and Una at the bottom of the page creates the central connection in the book
between the word “slut” and the narrator. While a disembodied face proclaims
“I am not a slut!” behind Una’s head, Una knows the word has been applied to
her in spite of her being a victim: </span>

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FullSizeRender.jpg">
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4568"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FullSizeRender.jpg"
alt="So I was flattered" width="1515" height="801" /></a>

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">The connection to the Yorkshire Ripper
here is that the police’s understanding that Peter Sutcliffe’s victims were
“only” prostitutes, in spite of that not being the case, led to them making
incorrect assumptions and mistakes. Una suggests that such assumptions and
mistakes afflict all women as the line she draws between herself and the
victims of the Ripper demonstrates. </span>

	&nbsp;

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a single page, Una sums up what the
1970s as a whole were like: </span>

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1970s.png"><img

Becoming Unbecoming, Myriad Editions, 2015" width="1510" height="1908" /></a>

	<span style="font-weight: 400;">At first we have the impulse to look at
the decade through rose coloured glasses, but reflection shows us a time of
great social upheaval and threats to a peaceful existence. But in the middle
of the page, Una talks about her own lack of concern for world events at the
time as she was wrapped up in simple pleasures: Blue Peter and sherbet. This,
we think, is the way that things should be. But as we read on in the book, we
see the centre of that page destroyed by the men who take advantage of Una
when she is a child. Instead of simple pleasure at the centre of the page,
 we see a picture of the Yorkshire Ripper, who, as Una tells us, was not some
spectacular monster, but an ordinary man of his time. </span>

<title>#221 The Comics Code Revisions of 1971, Will Eisner, and The Beginning
of Now</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The title above is a
bit misleading since I&#8217;m looking here to make a claim about cultural
shifts that act as impetus for aesthetic movements. While it&#8217;s always a
risky move to associate cultural shifts with aesthetic turns (sorry, a lot of
turning and shifting metaphors, but stay with me), comics in the 1970s
respond to socio-economics in a way that seems to entrench them as a
representative aesthetic medium. At the same time, and as a result of similar
reactive moves, the 1970s represent a watershed moment for freedom of
expression in comics outside the nature of its aesthetic practice. That is,
at the same time that comics are responding to the depressing socio-economic
conditions of the 1970s, they are also establishing new currents for
distribution. The result is the establishment of a comics cannon that, rather
than represent an ironic and heavily sexualized reactive underground (Crumb,
Pekar) or the Superman Condition (that anyone can be great as long as they
have superpowers), tends to lean more heavily on comics as a metaphor for
disenfranchised cultural representation. </p>

	<p>The disenfranchisement metaphor also extends to the establishment of
broader networks for distribution, figuratively disenfranchising Marvel and
DC monopolies in favour of a more open distribution method. Bottom line: the
Comics Code revision of 1971 might serve as a metaphor for the shifting
cultural hegemonies both inside and outside comics production that marks the
beginning of a more literary turn in comics production and aesthetic
representation. </p>

	<p>The 1970s represent a moment where the medium gets organized in a way
that is independent from the two major distribution houses of DC and Marvel.
A reformed code born out of shifting cultural ideals of the 1960s, a
do-it-yourself ethos also taken from the 1960s independent comics scene
couple with attention to more canonical forms of storytelling and a deeper
understanding of established tropes in comics production, suggests that the
1970s, rather than the countercultural production of the 1960s or the utopian
idealism Golden Age of the 1950s, may have been the beachhead moment for
comics as a valuable aesthetic medium capable of deep cultural commentary.
</p>

	<p>Will Eisner&#8217;s <em>Contract with God</em> appears in 1978 and,
though debatable, represents the beginning of comics as a
&#8220;literary&#8221; medium. The quotes around literary are there because
the stress here is on how comics turn in on there own aesthetic sensibilities
rather than how they ape literary stories or narratives. When we reimagine
New York in the 1970s for instance, it&#8217;s a long way from bring the
model for Batman&#8217;s Gotham or Superman&#8217;s Metropolis; it is a city
on the brink of bankruptcy. For from being a hub for cultural and economic
elites, New York is destitute. Its remaining aesthetic pioneers are those
that challenge the prevailing cultural currents by hanging out at Studio 54,
Warhol&#8217;s Factory, and frequenting Times Square&#8217;s pornographic
features such as <em>Deep Throat</em> and <em>Debbie Does Dallas</em>. One of
the interesting ways to think about this is that the 1970s has no
over-arching socio-cultural narrative&#8211;no civil rights movements,
economic prosperity, no fight against political collusion, no sexual
liberation, equal rights, only seemingly perpetual racial crisis, economic
crisis, political crisis, sexual crisis, moral crisis. What artists like
Eisner provide is precisely a narrative about American life that rather than
representing a press away from traditional modes of storytelling returns to
the well-worn, stable, social contract and moral foundations of aesthetic
practice. At the same time, the book asks legitimate questions around the
nature of contracts (social, sexual, moral, religious, economic) between the
ideal and the real that have, by the 1970s, been shattered for most. </p>

	<p>Of course, thinking about how <em>Contract with God</em> functions as
a metaphor for the disenfranchisement of the 1970s is where the connection to
socio-cultural conditions reaches its apex. In the backwash of 1960s idealism
and the riptide of the energy crisis Eisner&#8217;s narratives stand as
models for these disenfranchised populations. The tropes are uncommon for
comics at the time but representative of the time: socio-economic frustration
and disillusionment; domestic violence; racial, religious, and ethnic
questions. Where comics before may have offered an escape from the drudgeries
of everyday life, Eisner&#8217;s representation of the socio-economic climate
of 1970s is all too soaked in the depression of East Coast America. </p>

class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4576" /></a>

	<p>Another facet of <em>Contract with God</em> is that it breaks through
into the bookstore. Rather than appearing solely in the comic book store,
Eisner&#8217;s work problematizes the straight-line distribution model that
the medium itself precipitates. No longer &#8220;just a comic,&#8221; the
medium has extended its catalogue reference--exploded the limitations of
being labelled as a single genre. There&#8217;s some work to be done around
Eisner&#8217;s work being published by Baron Books, the house that also
published <em>Great Illustrated Classics</em>, but not here. The natural
extension of this publication displacement is the direct marketing of Dave
Sim, whose self-publishing ethos further extends the domain into which comics
might extend. Briefly, comics are clearly responding to the changing
socio-economic traditions both in terms of storylines (or aesthetic
representation) and distribution methodologies. </p>

	<p>This brief and entangled missive cannot do justice to the multifarious
currents that meet in 1970s comics production. That noted, its worth really
thinking about how the 1970s is under-represented in discourses about comics
history. Often focused on Eisner&#8217;s work, or that of Dave Sim, our
critical attention on the decade seems to attend to it as a bridge between
what comes before (Golden Era and rise of Independent Comics) and after
(1980s revival, 1990s super-hero re-entrenchment). </p>

	<p>Perhaps what&#8217;s important about the 1970s isn&#8217;t the comics
themselves, but the way the 1970s marked the end of the power contained in
the traditional Comics Code&#8211;and its &#8220;seal of approval&#8221;; the
end of the straight-line distribution model dominated by DC and Marvel; the
end of comics as a single medium or genre. All of which is replaced with
artistic and aesthetic integrity&#8211;or at least the sense of it; the birth
of direct marketing and other different distribution models, the sprawl of
comics as a medium, out of one genre category into many&#8211;hence the
&#8220;debates&#8221; around what to call it (Graphic Novel, sequential art,
comic, shit, etc.). Given these principles, the 1970s clearly encourage the
birth of a then nascent medium that will eventually yield more complex
culturally-relevant storylines (<em>Maus</em>), challenge the central
principles of comics design (<em>Watchmen</em>), force a re-contextualization
of comics&#8217; own canonical histories (<em>Batman: Dark Knight
Returns</em>), and a de-industrialized comics production (<em>Cerebus</em>).
It would seem that out of the hangover of the 1970s emerges the foundational
mechanics for comics as we understand them today.</p>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Writing about the 70s
in comics is a little problematic as we get further and further away from the
decade – two of the four central graphixians (myself included) weren’t even
born yet, and for me it’s always had a distant feel despite all of the
products that I would see growing up that promoted 70s culture and lifestyle.
I find it difficult to be nostalgic for an era I never knew, though I do get
to feel this vicariously in a way. The comics that I inherited from my father
were from the sixties and then, around when he stopped collecting, from the
70s. He made the tragic mistake of giving them to me as a toddler, and I have
the tattered, literally chewed up remains of the earliest issues of Justice
League, Green Lantern, Classics Illustrated and the like to show for it. My
father began collecting again with me when I was a boy and then a young man
to participate in what had become my hobby, but I got the feeling from him
that comics in his day were an altogether different experience. I’ve
retrieved and shown him some of his early comics and quoted the hundreds of
dollars that they would now be worth if they had been kept in good condition
(first appearance of Doom Patrol, first Jonah Hex, etc) which are now in
shambles – though they were tattered long before my tiny hands got ahold of
them. Instead of the expected regret I’ve been met with happy stories of how
they had been rolled up and put into his and others’ pockets and taken to
camp, how they would be read and reread and reread until nearly every panel
was memorized. In comparison, my world of collecting comics was bagging and
boarding, reading once – maybe twice – then treating them like the
investments that I knew they were. The result of the difference in reading
habits means that I now have tens of thousands of comics in pristine
condition and organized carefully in alphabetical order in complete runs. My
father’s comics, which now occupy a small box beside my larger collection in
my basement, are mostly coverless and in pieces, but have clearly been well
loved, over time and by many. I sometimes question which collection really
has more value.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cover1.jpg"><img
class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4587"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cover1-208x300.jpg"
alt="cover1" width="208" height="300" /></a>The comics that did survive my
small, probing, tearing teeth and fingers were those from the 70s that I
wasn’t allowed to see as a young boy – now inherited, these still remain in
the side collection despite being in far better shape, purchased when my
father was older, exploring more mature content and definitely never taking
them to camp. My favorite of these, and likely the brightest exemplar of the
simulacrum that I’ve built up in my mind to represent the 70s, is The
Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. The title first appeared serialized in
underground newspapers, was collected by Rip Off Press and published as bound
comics (my copies), later reprinted by Kitchen Sink and others down the line,
remaining in print today. The series continues to have a cult following,
having been adapted into 3D animation and even pornographic films over the
years – it’s a counterculture comic that has as its core drug use, depravity
and satire, knocking down equally social inequity and its own readership for
living wildly and on the fringes of society.

	The brainchild of Gilbert Shelton, the series exemplifies the spirit of
the era in looking at the predecessors of the hippies – the freaks who lived
irresponsibly and with abandon, less fashionable than the hippies who would
follow and typically aligned with recklessness, nudism, and a paranoia
against the oppressive nature of <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hippies.jpg"><img
class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4592"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hippies-297x300.jpg"
alt="hippies" width="297" height="300" /></a>society of the variety that can
only come from rampant hard drug use of all varieties. Following the exploits
of three drug-addled friends and their cat, the collected comics are a series
of one to six (give or take) page Archie-style vignettes that most often
aren’t particularly funny or insightful, though they are quite frequently
politically charged with a passionate distaste for normalcy and acquiescence
to authority. Drawn in the same detailed crosshatch style as Robert Crumb
whose Zap comix came out the same year as the Freak Brothers’ debut, the
cartooning has something of a filthy look, almost as if there is too much
detail where none should be. Filled with sex and drug gags, racism,
homophobia and sometimes misogyny, it’s difficult at first glance to <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/crosshatch.gif"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4593"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/crosshatch-297x300.
gif" alt="crosshatch" width="297" height="300" /></a>see why Freak Brothers
gained ground and retained its popularity over the years. On closer
inspection though, it’s the unfiltered nature of the underground comic that
carries the most weight and has the most impact because it’s self-consciously
mired in its cultural moment in a way that other comics are not. Highlighted
throughout are complaints about commodities prices, maligning particular
government policies, questioning the legal system and the casual racism that
were all a part of the era. I think to my own superhero-centric collection
from the 70s that I hoarded backwards over the years with Claremont, Ditko,
Buscema and Adams among countless others, and none of them have the clout
that a single issue of Freak Brothers has. It’s not because they’re
offensive, though they are, but because they are the era, unapologetically,
and regardless of how real the version of the 70s it presents is, for someone
like myself who never lived through the decade, it feels visceral and
palpable in a way I can’t achieve elsewhere.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/peedskills.jpg"><img
class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4591"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/peedskills-230x300.
jpg" alt="peedskills" width="230" height="300" /></a>Freak Brothers comics
make me curious about the culture of the 70s and, because of how they found
their way into my hands, make my wonder about my father’s participation in it
if this was what he was reading at the time. Zines and underground comics (or
comix, or however you’d like to refer to them) weren’t and aren’t beholden to
the standard value judgments that attend participation in the larger
marketplace. Comics already struggle on the farthest margins of literature,
and books like Freak Brothers are doubly removed from legitimacy. They’re not
predicated typically on aspirations of commercial success because that’s not
what their purpose ever was. They don’t have to adhere to a morality or theme
or even a consistency that would be attractive to typical advertisers – as
such, I’ve found they tend to be more honest and more compelling, and even in
their often grotesque caricatures it seems that I’m drawn into a world that
my X-Men and Batman comics from the period don’t let me get at. Despite them
not holding the same monetary value as the other of my father’s comics that I
destroyed, I’m particularly glad that these are what survived. And I think
it’s telling that I haven’t collected them beyond what my father passed down
to me, since really, I collect otherwise everything else I can get my hands
on – looking at my collecting habits objectively, I think that there would be
something inauthentic about searching online or elsewhere for the rest of
them, like they’d find their way into the wrong collection if I were to
acquire a full run to bag and board. For the time being and likely for good,
they’ll stay off to the side, and maybe even, eventually, find their way
again into a backpack or a pocket perhaps when my own son is old enough for
me to pass them along to.]]></content:encoded>

about the 1970s. I think everything that happened before I was born is
basically pointless. Kidding. Not really.  Luckily, I have a whole other much
better thing to tell you about instead. Last week, Peter and I were in London
to talk about creating on-line scholarly communities for alt-academic voices.
In other words, we were talking about Graphixia. And the audience was so
amazing that we have a huge bank of tweets to tell the story of our chat --
so I went ahead and Storified them! What follows is a compendium of the best

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[For ten days in
November there were numerous events throughout the UK as part of <a
href="http://beinghumanfestival.org/" target="_blank">Being Human: A Festival
of the Humanities</a>. In Dundee we celebrated the time Mary Shelley spent in
the city as a young woman, and how her experiences here, including watching
the whaling ships at the docks, would go on to influence her most famous book
<em>Frankenstein</em>. There were talks, walks, readings, and music but one
of the biggest events was the production and launch of <em><a
href="http://dundeecomicscreativespace.com/frankenstein/"
target="_blank">Frankenstein Begins, or Mary Shelley’s Dundee</a></em>, a
comic depicting Shelley’s sojourn in the city. Produced in-house at <a
href="http://dundeecomicscreativespace.com/" target="_blank">Dundee Comics
Creative Space</a> (my new place of work!), the comic was created by writer
<a href="http://www.dundee.ac.uk/humanities/staff/profile/chris-murray"
target="_blank">Chris Murray</a> and artist <a
href="https://norriemillar.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Norrie Millar</a>,
with design and lettering duties handled by <a
href="http://www.dundee.ac.uk/djcad/staff/phillipvaughan/"
target="_blank">Phillip Vaughan</a>. At the launch <a
href="http://www.dundeeds.co.uk/" target="_blank">Dundee Dramatic Society</a>
and students from Dundee College turned the comic into a short play.

	What has all this got to do with the 1970s? I hear the hordes of
Graphixia readers shout. Well, I’m getting to that. Also at the launch was
Graphixia contributor <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2014/04/16/163-jack-kirby-writer/">David
Robertson</a> of <a href="http://fredeggcomics.blogspot.co.uk/"
target="_blank">Fred Egg Comics</a>, who was performing a <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/deecap.comics/" target="_blank">DeeCAP</a>
presentation of his new strip <em><a
href="http://fredeggcomics.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/frankensteins-comic.html"
target="_blank">Frankensteins</a></em>. David talked about the different
versions of Frankenstein (or more specifically the creature) that he had
experienced during his life - from Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee in the
movies, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuHr00nxeew"
target="_blank">The Munsters</a> and <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBIPjNlKX7I" target="_blank">Groovie
Goolies</a> on TV, and on to <a
href="http://www.giantsizemarvel.com/2009/10/monsters-of-mike-ploog-
frankenstein.html" target="_blank">Mike Ploog’s adaptation</a> in comics.
Another comic strip that he touched on was <em><a
href="http://britishcomics.wikia.com/wiki/Frankie_Stein"
target="_blank">Frankie Stein</a></em> which appeared in several British
comics published by Odhams and IPC in the ‘60s and ‘70s.

	I was born in 1970 and so this is where I come in. Like David, I was
fascinated by the many incarnations of Frankenstein’s monster. Pretty much
every version in popular culture was derived from Boris Karloff’s iconic
version from the Universal monster films of the ‘30s. David also noted that
discovering that Frankenstein was the name of the creator and not the
creature was a childhood rite of passage. The Universal movies were
undergoing one of their periodic revivals in the 1970s, no doubt in part due
to the success of the Hammer horror films featuring different versions of the
copyright free characters. Toys and magazines featuring the monsters had been
flourishing since the early 1960s and I was excited to be able to read
<em>Frankie Stein</em> every week, as well as in the occasional annuals and
Summer Special editions.

Stein's first appearance in <em>Wham!</em> issue 4 11th July 1964[/caption]

	<em>Frankie Stein</em> was created in 1964 by <a
href="http://ukcomics.wikia.com/wiki/Ken_Reid_(1919-1987)"
target="_blank">Ken Reid</a>, who was even then well on his way to becoming a
superstar artist in UK comics. He had left school aged 14 and gone straight
to art school, and was apparently expelled a week before graduation for
hanging out in a café instead of going to class. He then set himself up as a
freelance artist and eventually contributed comics to the Manchester Evening
News. In the 1950s he was contacted by DC Thomson (DCT) to work on <em>The
Beano</em> and became the first artist to draw<em> <a
href="http://britishcomics.wikia.com/wiki/Roger_the_Dodger"
target="_blank">Rodger the Dodger</a></em> in 1953. From 1958 to 1963 he also
drew <em><a href="http://britishcomics.wikia.com/wiki/Jonah"
target="_blank">Jonah</a></em> in <em>The Beano</em>. This strip featured
some of Reid’s finest artwork. Jonah was a gormless sailor who would cause
the sinking of every ship he sailed in. This was usually accidental and often
Jonah appeared to not notice the destruction that he caused.

	The strip was written by Walter Fearne and was a perfect showcase for
Reid’s fevered imagination. Fearne would regularly supply a script that he
considered would need only a dozen panels. Reid would then supply the page of
art with up to 36 panels, “the way Fearne described a particular incident
often set me off on a train of thought that had me creating additional
scenes. I admit that sometimes I simply got carried away with things.” Reid
getting carried away was hugely popular with the readers, and Jonah became
the most popular strip in <em>The Beano</em>. At last year’s Comics Unmasked
exhibition at the British Library there was a 2-page strip of <em>Jonah</em>
original art on display, which was worth the admission price on its own. The
size and detail of the page was jaw-droppingly impressive. Dense with ‘<a
href="http://mag.uchicago.edu/arts-humanities/chicken-fat"
target="_blank">chicken fat</a>,’ even small elements such as a cheeky
Scottish carp character responsible for misleading the Loch Ness Monster,
were done with a huge amount of attention to detail and humour, a sensibility
that permeated all of Reid’s work.

	In the 1960s DCT rivals Odhams offered him a massive increase in his page
rate and the opportunity to write his own stories as well as draw them. Reid
didn’t want to leave DCT but the chance was too good to pass up. He could now
indulge in his passion for slapstick horror comics and <em>Frankie Stein</em>
was brought to life. Another of Reid’s strips in this genre was also hugely
popular; <em><a href="http://britishcomics.wikia.com/wiki/Faceache"
target="_blank">Faceache</a></em> first appeared in <em>Jet</em> in 1971 and
featured Ricky Rubberneck a young boy who could “scrunge” his face (and later
his whole body) into various monstrous shapes. Reid died in 1987 having been
named Best Writer and Best Artist by the Society of Strip Illustrators in
1978.

	Recently I was conducting some research on my own practice as an artist
and comic book maker for a presentation and I came across the cover to the
<em>Frankie Stein</em> annual from 1977 with its unusual depiction of Frankie
as a superhero. Although not drawn by Reid, it prompted a massive Proustian
involuntary memory, a bit like reading David Robertson’s strip. I had this
book as a child and I spent hours poring over it and drawing my own versions.
I can see the influence permeating my own work especially on the cover to
<em>The Adventures of Ticking Boy</em> with its debt to superhero comics,
although inside several of my stories have a more Promethean theme akin to
the usual <em>Frankie Stein</em> strips. It seems like any comic reading kid
from the 1970s has a little bit of Ken Reid in their comics DNA.

alt="1444747225533" width="700" height="444" />

	In a move that will astonish my friends and colleagues I would like to
discuss Michel Rabagliati’s comics, specifically his most recent book
<em>Paul dans le nord</em>. Rabagliati’s comics are semi-autobiographical
texts that tell the story of his eponymous hero’s life, love and heartbreaks.
His best-known book <em>Paul à Québec</em> was recently made into a film and
his books are beloved of comics fans from Quebec and further afield. <em>Paul
dans le Nord</em> was released in mid November and tells the tale of Paul’s
difficult teenage years. Following the touching stories of pre-teen life in
<em>Paul au Parc</em> the Paul of these stories is often sullen, fairly
sexist and then occasionally and suddenly childlike with his parents. Caught
in that terrible limbo of being not quite an adult and not still a child Paul
visits a strip club, experiences his first kisses, and gets dumped for a
hotter, cooler, older guy.

	Rather touchingly Rabagliati dedicates the book to his parents, and the
story moves in a circle from the opening pages where Paul refuses to help his
dad work on their holiday home, to the final moments where he approaches his
dad and offers to help him with work on the house. The whole book is an
occasionally awkward love letter to growing up in Montreal in the 1970s.
Overshadowed by the promise of the 1976 Montreal Olympics, the games provide
a source of excitement to Paul and his friends, as well as reminding the
contemporary reader of the farce of the construction and planning of the
event (Montrealers were still paying for the Olympic Games decades after the
event via a special tax on cigarettes).

	Rabagliati’s 1970s has previously been a space in which he was able to
address difficult topics, in <em>Paul au Parc</em> he discussed the tragic
death of members of his scout troup in a bus accident, using his touching
memories of the time to soften the edges of this tragedy. He also obliquely
addressed his recollections of the tensions and of October 1970 and the
violent actions of the Front de Libération du Québec. However, <em>Paul dans
le Nord</em> is somewhat less gentle in its representations of the brashness,
casual misogyny and general realities of life in Quebec in 1976. Paul and his
uncle visit a strip club, he awkwardly witnesses his uncle catcall women in
the street and he sits through a series of eye-opening encounters as he and
his friend hitchhike north. All of a sudden Paul’s stories are not wistful
recollections of his somewhat idyllic life in Montreal, but rather showing
the more seedy side of being a teenage boy at the time and reflecting the
uncertainties of life in the province at this moment. The final third of the
book provides some respite, Paul falls in love and as the opening ceremony of
the Olympics is shown on television everything in his life seems to be
falling into place. This piece has been spoiler laden enough so I’m not going
to tell you how Paul’s relationship works out but you really should go and
read it asap…

	This is definitely a book I want to come back to. Rabagliati’s stories
and his art never fail to reward a second/third/twentieth attempt at reading
them. I want to bury myself in the detail of his pages. I want to explore
more how I feel about the softer, nostalgic edges being rubbed off this
latest incarnation of the Paul series. I definitely want to think a bit more
about the full colour double page spread in the middle of the book. If
<em>Paul à Québec</em> was Rabagliati’s coming of age story then this is the
one where he has complicated that notion. As Paul approaches adulthood,
Rabagliati is moving away from the gentler nostalgia that tinged the pages of
<em>Paul au Parc</em> and instead showing us the darker side of this decade
of enormous change for Quebec and its residents, alongside the more difficult
and uncomfortable elements of being a teenager.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I’m going to get a
little personal with this post, as the theme of comics from the seventies has
provided me with a great excuse to talk about one of my favourite subjects
for cartooning and something that is likely to make me pick up a comic if
it’s included: cats. Preferably talking cats, but either way, cats. You might
call it my pet subject, when I'm not banging on about neoliberalism.  I’ll
admit that I struggled to think of a seventies comic, series or graphic novel
that really grabbed me enough for me to want to write about it, despite the
decade being a momentous time with the changes to the Comics Code and the
aesthetic developments culminating in Will Eisner’s graphic novel <em>A
Contract With God</em> (1978), <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2015/11/03/221-the-comics-code-revisions
-of-1971-will-eisner-and-the-beginning-of-now/">as Dave covered in his
post</a>. Being a huge fan of self-publishing and the DIY ethos celebrated by
the likes of Jeff Smith and John Porcellino, I was poised to write about Dave
Sim’s <em>Cerebus</em> being the genesis of this, but <em>Cerebus </em>didn’t
really hit its stride (commercially or in terms of its cartooning being
effective and engaging) until the eighties, so I felt like that would have
been cheating. I then thought I might write about Peanuts being at the peak
of its commercial success in the seventies, and still managing to retain its
brilliance and transcendent, hilarious humanity throughout, but before I did
so, I read <a
href="http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/25_emblematic_comics_of_the_70s
/" target="_blank">this great roundup of seventies comics</a> from Tom
Spurgeon, and found exactly what I’d been looking for in the shape of B.
Kliban and a gigantic, funny-faced cat. Spurgeon called Kliban “the funniest
cartoonist of the decade, edging out [Gilbert] Shelton and [Garry] Trudeau,”
and that grabbed me right away, encouraging me to click through hundreds of
Kliban’s cats <a href="http://www.gocomics.com/klibans-cats/">on
GoComics</a>, which now collects the contents of his 1975 book <em>Cat</em>
and releases them as daily comics.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/klic.klic120424.gif"
><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4637"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/klic.klic120424.gif"
alt="klic.klic120424" width="600" height="434" /></a>  I’m sure I’d never
heard of Playboy cartoonist B. Kliban until this week, but I instantly
recognised his style and, more significantly, an excellent command of cats –
something I’m always on the lookout for in fellow cartoonists, hoping to pick
up tips for my own feline creations. He’s good at cat anatomy and at
capturing movement (I can’t remember who it was who said that when you draw,
you draw the pounce of the cat rather than the cat itself), but more than
that, he captures their <a
href="http://www.gocomics.com/klibans-cats/2012/06/07">playfulness</a>, their
aloofness, their absurdness, their idiocy, the strangeness of how they act in
a world they clearly think belongs to them but is somehow dominated by large,
snooty, strange humans. Kliban’s cats talk very rarely. In fact, the vast
majority of his cats just doing human things, often quotidian things, and I
find this aspect of his cat cartoons quite charming. Often, too, his cats are
shown indulging in hedonism, or living a life of luxury. There is always a
level of absurdity to a cat doing anything, especially heightened with
anthropomorphism. However, once you enter the world of Kliban’s cats there is
never a feeling of jarring or sharp absurdity or strangeness. Why wouldn’t
cats sit in a hot tub and gaze upon the Golden Gate Bridge in the sunset?  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/klic.klic120724.gif"
><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4638"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/klic.klic120724.gif"
alt="klic.klic120724" width="600" height="517" /></a>The main thing that hit
me about Kliban, however, was not the comics themselves, but a quote from him
in his <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/14/obituaries/b-kliban-55-a-cartoonist-
who-drew-zany-cats.html" target="_blank">New York Times obituary</a> (he died
somewhat prematurely in 1990 aged 55 – I wonder if he’d be a bigger and more
widely studied name in comics if he had lived through the 1990s and 2000s):
<p style="padding-left: 60px">''People assume I'm gaga about cats,'' he said
in 1978. He added: ''I like them, but I'm not silly about them. Cats look
like cartoons. There's something funny and vulnerable and innocent about
them.''</p> Now, I’ve been <a
href="https://medium.com/@paddyjohnston/long-divisions-2-extract-56e81e11f7e2
#.wrpoa7q7o" target="_blank">drawing cats</a> for a year or two, and have
been writing about cats for a lot longer. My undergraduate dissertation was a
study of talking cats in literature and television, from <em>Kafka on the
Shore</em> to <em>Sabrina the Teenage Witch</em>. However, I didn’t grow up
with cats, partly because my dad is allergic, and I still don’t properly have
one – there’s just a neighbourhood cat that comes and goes, that takes my
food and my love and disappears into the night. I’ve just always been
fascinated by them and how they both mirror and confuse people, and how they
have such a unique relationship with humans. I’ve been thinking for some time
that comics is the perfect medium for this, due to the prevalence of great
work in this area (see <a
href="http://www.octopuspie.com/2009-03-06/octopus-pie-theater-presents-great
-throwups-in-cat-history/" target="_blank">Meredith Gran</a>, <a
href="http://www.page45.com/store/King-Cat-Comics-Stories-75.html"
target="_blank">John Porcellino</a>, <a
href="http://awiderbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/
47435_428927379260_6393553_n.jpg" target="_blank">Ilana Zeffren</a>, <a
href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/titles/cats-are-weird.html"
target="_blank">Jeffrey Brown</a>, to name but a few) and my own fulfilment
in drawing them. However, I hadn’t yet found such a neat distillation of why
it is that cats make such great subjects for cartooning, and this little
quote from Kliman totally nailed it. They’re visually exciting in a way that
lends itself to comics and to the fluidity and expressiveness of the physical
act of drawing, and they’re also funny and strange.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/
tumblr_me9aiqyOTw1qli3bjo1_500.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full
wp-image-4639"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/
tumblr_me9aiqyOTw1qli3bjo1_500.jpg" alt="tumblr_me9aiqyOTw1qli3bjo1_500"
width="500" height="375" /></a>  If there’s a message in this, it’s that the
seventies probably contains clues as to the development of things that we
like to draw today, and that the single-panel cartoons and comic strips of
the seventies had a bigger influence than we might care to give them credit
for. It’s easy to forget, with newspapers and especially Sunday strips in
steady decline in terms of readership since the eighties, that there was a
time when pretty much everybody – in the UK and North America, at least – was
reading some kind of strip or single-panel cartoon in the paper on Sundays,
if not daily in a magazine. This level of popularity can’t not permeate, and
I’d venture to say that the strips of the seventies have had a huge effect,
in terms of visual subconscious, on the art form of cartooning in the
subsequent decades, right up to the present day. I’d need a lot more examples
to prove this, of course, but having found an instant connection between
Kliban’s cats and my own, it feels very real to me right now.  Also, drawing
cats is fun. Go and draw a cat right now. Go on. I dare you. And for the
record, I also love dogs. I don’t think it has to be either/or. Draw cats,
draw dogs, go have fun like they did in the seventies. Maybe you’ll be able
to merchandise your cartoons just like B. Kliban did.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p
class="p1"><b></b><span class="s1"> The 1970s represent a watershed moment
for comics worldwide in terms of their openings to ‘adult’ themes and
readers. (Of course, this is the dominant narrative of comics history and one
that is oversimplifying, but let's leave this to another post.) The renewal
of the comics form had already taken place in the 1960s, under pioneering
comics experiments (let's just cite Jean-Claude Forest's <i>Barbarella </i>in
1962) and first inklings of the underground, but these trends would truly
come to blossom in the 1970s: not just in terms of what was drawn and
written, but also and perhaps even most importantly in the production,
distribution, and reception channels that made this possible. <a
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2015/11/03/221-the-comics-code-revisions
-of-1971-will-eisner-and-the-beginning-of-now/"><span
class="s2">David</span></a> already made that clear with his post on the
comics code revisions of 1971 that somehow came to establish “the
foundational mechanics for comics as we understand them today.” In Europe,
this change happens through a geographical shift from Belgium to France,
pioneered by magazines such as <i>Pilote</i> and <i>Hara Kiri </i>which would
lead to a plethora of excellent comics magazines: <i>L'Écho des Savanes,
Métal Hurlant, Charlie Mensuel, </i>etc. This frenzy was also fed by the
<i>bédéphile </i>movements of the late 1960s and 1970s, which sought to
recover the history of the medium (although often with a strong nostalgic
tone). Finally, and most importantly for this post, Japanese comics also
underwent a similar transformation, embodied by the alternative manga
magazine <i>Garo</i>, started in 1964 but reaching its acme in the 1970s.
While extremely popular in the ‘mainstream’ market with his <i>Kitaro
</i>series continuously put out since the 1960s, Shigeru Mizuki was indeed a
staple of the famous <i>Garo </i>magazine, next to the likes of Yoshihiro
Tatsumi, Yoshiharu Tsuge or the comparatively underrated Susumu Katsumata. I
am not exactly going to talk about <i>Garo </i>or 70s alternative manga<i>
</i>in this post, as I am nowhere near being knowledgeable on manga (the
above cited names represent the full scope of my familiarity with the form),
but I would like to pay homage to Shigeru Mizuki (1922-2015), who passed away
only a few weeks ago on November 30. </span></p> <p class="p3"><span
class="s1"> Although it would be hard to reduce to one decade the entire
oeuvre of a cartoonist who has truly lived through all of postwar manga
history, it is arguably in the 1970s that Mizuki produced his best (covertly)
autobiographical output, with <i>Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths </i>in 1973
and <i>NonNonBa </i>in 1977. Published in the 1970s, their international
breakthrough, however, has been quite belated, as Shigeru Mizuki's work was
only translated in the twenty-first century, finally finding a larger
audience in Europe and North-America thanks to the wonderful translations of
Cornélius (2006 for <i>NonNonBâ </i>and 2008 for <i>Opération mort</i>) and
Drawn &amp; Quarterly (2011 for <i>Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths </i>and
2012 for <i>NonNonBa</i>). This late appraisal of the celebrated cartoonist
seems related to several factors: the wider success of manga as a whole in
Europe and America (although the first wave of translations in the 1990s was
not driven by a patrimonial goal), but also the ‘literary’ turn ignited in
the 1970s, which would strengthen in the late 80s to become institutionalized
in the 2000s, putting the graphic memoir firmly on the map. This history
shows very well the deep connexions between some pioneering experiments of
the 1970s and how they are now being established as cornerstones of comics
history – a retrospective canonization that always leaves out entire segments
of the production (if we talk about the ‘adult’ comics of the 1970s, it is
very rare to address its more ‘crassly commercial’ objects – I am thinking of
the small pocket-book comics we call in French the <i>petits formats</i> –
which were nonetheless very much part of what comics were and meant at the
time).</span></p> <p class="p3"><span class="s1"> But back to Mizuki's
comics, which always seem to hone in on a certain dualism, to bring together
seemingly opposite facets: as <a
href="http://www.cornelius.fr/blog/index.php?post/2015/12/04/Mizuki-sensei"><
span class="s2">Jean-Louis Gauthey</span></a> (head of Cornélius) wrote in
his obituary, Mizuki's style “brings together that which is incompatible –
caricature and hyperrealism, autobiography and fantastical, dark humor and
celebration of life.” This well-known stylistic mix made his graphic
‘trademark’: the opposition between faces drawn in a very expressive cartoon
style and the highly detailed realistic backgrounds often drawn from
photographs. This stylistic contrast enhances the social-critical stakes of
his books and, as <a
href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/shigeru-mizukis-war-
haunted-creatures"><span class="s2">Matt Alt</span></a> remarked at <i>The
New Yorker</i>, makes for the continued relevance of his work
today:</span></p>  <blockquote> <p class="p5"><span class="s1">This schism
between realism and cartoon amplifies the absurdity of his story lines,
letting him sneak in his social criticisms. He was the last of Japan’s manga
artists to have experienced the horrors of battle firsthand, and spent his
career pushing back against those who would glorify them. In an era when the
nation’s leadership seems hell-bent on expanding the military’s role,
respected critics like Mizuki will be greatly missed.</span></p>
</blockquote> <p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rereading <i>Onward Towards Our
Noble Deaths</i>, I was particularly stricken by how this contrast is played
up at different levels. The hyperrealism is most obviously used to draw many
photographs into the narratives, letting the documentary work breathe through
the pages, adding a strong layer of authenticity to the gruesome and absurd
tragedy of the war – a layer with which the caricatural faces of the
characters and their slapstick antics create a bitter, ironic dialogue.
</span></p> <p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b> <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/onward-art.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter wp-image-4671 size-full"

alt="onward-art" width="465" height="666" /></a></b></span></p> <p
class="p3"><span class="s1"> But what struck me most was the careful graphic
attention paid to nature, to the background of the jungle as a tragic
counterpoint to the chaotic dwellings of soldiers caught up in the deathly
logic of warfare. Nature comes up everywhere as a backdrop in <i>Onward
Towards Our Noble Deaths</i>, to the point that it frequently encroaches upon
the narrative focus on the characters, their adventures, the ongoing
storyline. This is clear in panels where the human figures recede to small
shapes, hardly distinguishable amongst the carefully rendered textures of
grass, leaves, trees, and other plants. But nature also takes center stage in
autonomous panels that seem nearly out of sequence, that disrupt the
narrative economy that otherwise links the panels together – a bit similar to
the soldier's own moments of break spent fooling around. At one point later
in the narrative, the army doctor makes a strong plea against war, militarism
and the treatment given to soldiers, emphasizing the nature as the life that
surrounds them. As a rather late passage in the story, it has the benefit of
foregrounding this contrast that visually runs throughout the book between
the ‘life’ of nature and the ‘death’ of human warfare – an opposition that
is, again, absolutely topical for today. Speaking to us from the 1970s,
Mizuki's voice will undoubtedly continue to resonate for a long time
ahead.</span></p> <p class="p3"><a

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;  <span
style="font-weight: 400;">The concepts of utility and relevance are vexed for
the arts in general and comics in particular. That is, in order to get
institutional and social recognition in an age devoted to instrumental
reason, we argue that comics are relevant because they are useful; they teach
people how to do things that can help them with their self-advancement and
success in the worlds of education and employment. </span>  &nbsp;  <span
style="font-weight: 400;">When we do this, we fall subject to a kind of
totalitarian thinking: everything must fall under the logic of productivity,
improvement, and industry. Such thinking makes pleasure and aesthetics mere
tools in production. Pedagogically, we see this phenomenon in the drive to
“make learning fun,” which is really a drive to put “fun” in the service of
learning. Pleasure, fun, sensation cannot be left to float around freely. At
the same time, learning is not seen as always already fun; it requires fun as
a supplement because fun is the essential thing learning excludes in the
first place. </span>  &nbsp;  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the
counter to the utility of pleasure is escapism, which is a kind of utility in
itself. Art means nothing; it’s just a way for consumers to blow off steam
which in turn makes them happier in their life and work. In this case, the
cheaper and shoddier the art the better. This is the logic in which Adam
Sandler films are superior to those of Wim Wenders, which try too hard to
make us “think” and are therefore not useful. </span>  &nbsp;  <span
style="font-weight: 400;">I think these positions represent the meaning of
art in the neoliberal (or is it neo-conservative) milieu: on the one hand,
art must be useful in a serious sense; on the other, art must be meaningless
escapism (useless in itself but useful in what it accomplishes). It’s enough
to drive one into decadent “art for art’s sake” posturing, or dada. </span> 
&nbsp;  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The first volume of the Secret
Smithsonian Adventures, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wrong
Wrights</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is an example of the
confusion of these positions in its efforts to make comics useful: it’s a
comic book aimed at children (9-12) that aims to teach them something about
the history of flight. At the same time it is an advertisement for the
Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum. This comic is not only useful,
it also maximizes its utility. </span>  &nbsp;  <i><span style="font-weight:
400;">The Wrong Wrights</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> engages
young readers by pulling out all the stops: there’s time travel, nefarious
identity theft, and some danger to our crew of four kids who win a special
trip to the National Air and Space Museum for their academic prowess only to
get whisked off into a historical dimension parallel to the 1909 in which the
Wright Brothers made their famous flight around the Statue of Liberty. The
point is that the kids get to help rescue history from a wrong turn. What’s
curious, though, is that in the name of making history “fun” the comic makes
history ahistorical (unhistorical?), which raises the question of how useful
this book is as history or even advertisement for history, which I guess is
what it really is. </span>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/001.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4712"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/001-1024x517.jpg"
alt="001" width="1024" height="517" /></a>  <span style="font-weight:
400;">The premise of the book is that ne’er do wells kidnap the Wrights to
prevent them from making their flight, hoping to save the world of flight for
dirigibles. When the four main characters enter the National Museum of Space
and Flight, they see only balloons and airships, no airplanes. </span>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/003.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4714"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/003-1024x1021.jpg"
alt="003" width="1024" height="1021" /></a>  <span style="font-weight:
400;">This is where the ahistorical/unhistorical bit comes in. Though the
book tells us that the Wrights had already made successful airplane flights
in Europe, it suggests that if the Wrights had not made the flight in New
York on that fateful day, the airplane would never have happened. Such a
suggestion portrays a complete misunderstanding of the way the development of
technology works. As the book suggests, several people were working on
airplanes at the same time. If not the Wrights, then someone else would have
made that flight. But this book is committed to the individual heroic genius
theory of invention, rather than the notion of multiple thinkers and
experimenters reaching a critical mass. </span>  &nbsp;  <span
style="font-weight: 400;">Curiously, on another level, the book defuses the
Wright Brothers’ claim to sole authorship of the airplane by emphasising the
significance of their sister Katharine, who has been mostly ignored in the
mythology. Indeed, as Orville and Wilbur have been kidnapped, Katherine takes
their place and conducts the fateful flight that puts airplanes rather than
dirigibles in the museum. If anyone, Katharine (with help from the kids) is
the hero of this piece, decentering her kin. </span>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/002.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4713"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/002.jpg" alt="002"
width="566" height="562" /></a>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m all for
giving Katharine her historical due, and accept that without her support, her
brothers may never have had the success they did. But I wonder why it had to
be done in this particular way, using fictionalized fantasy to restore the
airplane to its proper place in the National Air and Space Museum. Could it
be that the original story is just not fun enough? </span>  &nbsp;  <span
style="font-weight: 400;">Granted, I am not in the 9-12 age demographic that
is the intended audience for this book, but it left me imagining how good a
serious graphic history of the Wright Brothers and Sister and their place in
the development of heavier than air flight could be. And if I cast myself
back into my 9-12 year old person, I believe that’s what I would have wanted
then as well. The problem with comics (and other books) that are designed for
children is the presumption of what the audience wants filtered through the
idea of what they are supposed to get. Few things are less fun than a
supposedly “fun” book with an ulterior motive. And the more ulterior the
motive, the more “fun” gimmicks are required. Far better to poke fun at
something serious: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wrong
Wrights</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made me turn to Monty
Python’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Golden Age of
Ballooning</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a tonic. Now that
was something I enjoyed as a 9-12 year old. </span>  &nbsp;  <span
style="font-weight: 400;">But this book feels focus grouped to death. The
distribution of the narrative focus across four characters (who tend to work
in gender pairs) allows for diversity (two boys, two girls, two apparently
caucasian characters, two characters of colour) but detracts from intensity
of focus and identification.  None of the four kids stands out much because
the book takes such pains to avoid having one be pre-eminent. Who wants such
bland diversity? Let the black girl take charge for goodness’ sake. It’s
ironic that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wrong
Wrights</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> supports a romantic,
heroic concept of invention (sort of)  but not of narrative. </span>  &nbsp; 
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the adventure fantasy of the
narrative must give way to historical truth. On the last page of the comic, a
heretofore non-existent narrator steps in to put everything right. The ironic
statement about writers and artists changing history to tell a good story
seems a half-hearted apology for how the comic has messed around with history
to make it “fun.” This page has an “and it was all a dream” quality to it.
Again, I wonder why they don’t give the history of the Wrights or even just
Katharine Wright in graphic form. It’s a good enough story.</span>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/004.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4715"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/004-704x1024.jpg"
alt="004" width="704" height="1024" /></a>  &nbsp;  <span style="font-weight:
400;">The presumption that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The
Wrong Wrights</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> makes is that
history is not fun for 9-12 year olds. Comics, on the other hand, are
supposed to be fun. And because comics are supposed to be fun, they require
time travel, chase scenes, rescues, and wrist bands connected to an
artificial intelligence, elements that lead us out of history and into
escapism. So we end up with a bizarre combination of serious and non-serious
utility that submits the comics form to instrumental reason for pre-teens.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re on an
open thread this time around and, given that we&#8217;re pretty close to the
beginning of May, I always get a little sentimental about this space.
Graphixia started with <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/2010/10/fun-home-and-secret-identity/">a
post</a> in October 2010, but we didn&#8217;t start keeping stats until May
1, 2011, which is pretty close to five full years ago. That is one hell of a
long time ago. Everything was five years younger than it is now. Since that
time Graphixia has the following line: 86,555 Pageviews, 66,269 Unique
Pageviews, an average time on site of 1:47&#8211;an eternity in internet
terms, with all its glancing and scanning and probing. Comics are not nearly
as controversial as they were five years ago. It seems weird to say, but five
years has changed things quite bit&#8211;we were still calling them
&#8220;graphic novels&#8221; five years ago. Graphixia has centred itself
against the rising tide of comics and ridden the wave to where it is now.
</p>  <p>The most read post is one about <em>Hawkeye</em> that has to do with
<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/2013/07/123-hawkeye-11-anthropomorphic-
skeuomorphisms/">Anthropomorphism and Skeumorphism</a>, which received the
benefit of a very popular retweet. Since that time, as authors, we have
engaged with creators through Twitter, interviewed them on YouTube, presented
papers, written several articles in peer-reviewed journals and book chapters.
We&#8217;ve grown from Peter Wilkins and I, to a global entourage of scholars
from Canada, England, Scotland, Belgium, and other guest posts from I know
not where. The core group of contributors, me, Peter, Brenna, and Scott all
still contribute on a regular basis. </p>  <p>I note all this because I think
this is a good example of how scholarship can work at a grassroots level.
Graphixia takes the discussion of comics seriously most of the time. There
are notable exceptions of course, and I&#8217;ll get to why those are
important in a moment. As an editorial group&#8211;well mostly just myself,
Peter, and Brenna&#8211;we infrequently have heated discussions about how
&#8220;serious&#8221; or &#8220;academic&#8221; we should be. Sometimes, we
have discussion about how Graphixia might be a beachhead (to use a word Peter
deploys often) for conversations about comics. I have always maintained that
Graphixia started as a counter-narrative to any kind of serious pressure and
we should be doing more to challenge the prescriptions of serious discourse.
As with all good partnerships, we always leave these conversations a little
richer for the other&#8217;s opinion and we always manage to see the benefit
and principles behind the other&#8217;s diatribe. Having a platform as
flexible and fluid as Graphixia, with no real set agenda, provides an
excellent context for these ongoing discussions about what actually defines
&#8220;serious&#8221; discourse. I have always liked to define
Graphixia&#8217;s approach as shallow depth. All this to say, that an absence
of prescriptions and conventions has resulted in a lot of writing, a lot of
work, a lot. It&#8217;s worth pushing Graphixia forward as an example of how
scholarship works when it&#8217;s not really scholarship, but public
discourse out in the open. </p>  <p>Sometimes, we build it and no one comes
(like our last <a href="http://graphixia.ca/comicsandmassmedia/">Comics and
Mass Media gambit</a>&#8211;where the hell were you guys anyway?). Graphixia
is still representative of a pretty closed system, we&#8217;re mostly male,
mostly White, mostly Western, and mostly educated&#8211;but at least
we&#8217;re aware of it! We get great reaction to, and reflection upon, our
work most of the time but it&#8217;s mostly from people we know. We may not
be a global powerhouse on par with BoingBoing, but we have a reasonably
diverse group that represent a few different perspectives. Point is, for all
its glaring omissions&#8211;usually from me&#8211;and its mashup of personal
narrative, critical distance, rage, genuine curiosity, Graphixia still stands
as a convoluted repository for a group&#8217;s thinkings about comics.
What&#8217;s more interesting is how Graphixia reflects our growth as readers
of comics&#8211;go back and look at the early entries; they&#8217;re all on
&#8220;canonical&#8221; books&#8211;<em>Watchmen</em>, <em>Louis Riel</em>,
<em>Batman</em>, <em>Spiderman</em>. Then, we take a turn&#8211;thanks to
Brenna&#8211;and do more theme sessions (which we should totally do more of)
on Jeff Lemire and the like. One can see our development as a crew, how we
change and morph as we read more and participate more and engage in all the
ancillary discussions generated out of our expanding community. We&#8217;re
always open to more members.</p>  <p>Now, to get back to the number above.
That post I wrote on <em>Hawkeye</em> has been looked at, or read, depending
upon your generosity of interpretation, according to google stats, 1804
times. At 3:35 average time on page, there&#8217;s a generous number of
people lingering over the piece&#8211;perhaps leaving their browser window
hanging open while they go read the comic, which is fine. Suffice to say, of
anything I have ever written that bit about <em>Hawkeye</em> is by far the
most-read, most-looked-at thing. Graphixia as a whole is the most looked at
thing I&#8217;ve ever been a part of too. Our distribution system boils down
to Brenna&#8217;s retweets and twitter in general. We&#8217;re not in
libraries, we&#8217;re not in bookstores, there&#8217;s nothing to sell,
nothing to even address, just a bunch of people
talking&#8211;semi-seriously&#8211;about stuff related to comics. Somehow,
we&#8217;ve managed to pull this off for five freaking years. </p>  <p>In the
meantime, Peter and I are a long way from where we were when we started
Graphixia. He&#8217;s really the one who does comics now; I&#8217;ve
admittedly diverted into other areas more closely aligned with the Digital
Humanities. But, man, Peter is still right on it and so is Brenna. I really
enjoy watching things emerge from Graphixia, so it&#8217;s important to me
that Peter and Brenna&#8211;the two early adopters&#8211;are still on it. At
the same time, I would never have diverged into the other things I do now if
it weren&#8217;t for Graphixia. As the site&#8217;s chief engineer, I needed
to learn Wordpress, other technical stuff, and so I used Graphixia as
leverage to start other more complex coding projects and experimentations. So
maybe for me it&#8217;s not comics so much anymore, but the community in
which I now find myself would never been found without the pressure to create
an open space for talking about comics.</p>  <p>Graphixia is a fantastic mix
of all the political interests entangled within the people who write for it.
That&#8217;s what open access is about for me: entanglement. Distorting the
traditionally clear lines of ownership, authorship, audience and
subject-matter while exploiting the internet&#8217;s ability to distort
geographies, space, representation, and subject attention (the interest we
pay to certain esoteric things such as comics, for instance). We have all
entered into the traditional peer-reviewed world&#8211;we have PhDs, are
writing PhDs, articles, papers, conferences, etc. So, we haven&#8217;t
altogether left the traditional confines of the towers of knowledge to which
we ultimately belong and that we ultimately represent. But, whatever,
Graphixia represents a space where, one could, if one wanted, shed all of
those labels and write whatever the fuck one wanted&#8211;as long as
it&#8217;s about comics. And that has made all the difference.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've nothing to say,
dear Graphixians. I've nothing to say.  And yet, here I am, typing away to
you late on a Tuesday. Because it's my week to post, you see. And because
Graphixia is something I've been keeping up my commitment to for the last
five years. And because that commitment is valuable.  But I've nothing to
say.  It's been an up-and-down kind of five years, academically-speaking.
I've had successes and failures, and I've accomplished lots of really great
things and failed to accomplish much, much greater things. But in spite of
new positions attained and books unfinished, I'm still a Graphixian. There's
not much else that has felt constant about my identity as an academic in
these first years post-PhD, but I've been a Graphixian for most of them. That
means a lot to me.  I didn't think of myself as a comics scholar when I
joined Graphixia. I do now. 250, 500, 1000 words at a time, I wrote towards a
new academic identity, one that has simultaneously welcomed and infuriated me
-- like any true family, I suppose.  Because of Graphixia, I've been asked to
contribute to book collections and encyclopedias, give invited talks, help
organize a conference, travel, present at conferences, act as a peer
reviewer, serve on an editorial board, and edit a collection. 250, 500, 1000
words at a time I've written myself a tiny corner of expertise that is mine,
and that people know is mine, and that stands apart from any work I did as a
graduate student.  My adult identity as a scholar is as much a product of
Graphixia as of my education.  Someone wise -- well, Peter -- once said that
we should never underestimate the power of short, consistent, committed
writing practice. This is an innovation to my workflow that the Graphixia
project has given me, and it has made for a productive five years. 250, 500,
1000 words at a time, I have written and published more, both for scholarly
and popular sources, in the last five years than in any other period in my
life.  Someone wise -- well, Dave -- once said that doing the work publicly
is important, too. Tomorrow, someone is going to interview me about <a
href="http://tinyletter.com/brenna">my TinyLetter</a>, wherein I am often
very open and public about my failings, shortcomings, and anxieties as a
junior scholar. I learned how to do that, too, at Graphixia. To float a
theory in 250, 500, 1000 words at a time, because I have 45 minutes and no
one else to float the idea to but you, Graphixians. I have written my way
into good arguments and bad ones, ones I am proud to own and ones I cringe at
now. But they're all mine, and they're all here, and they're all part of the
narrative of my journey as a scholar.  Never believe people who seem to know
what they're doing all the time. They're lying to you. Trust people who fail
staggeringly, spectacularly in public. Then help them pick themselves up and
start again.  It has been a crushing semester. I'm terribly tired.  This
month, Graphixians, I've nothing to say.  But the lesson of Graphixia is
knowing that 250, 500, 1000 words at a time, I will.
Eventually.]]></content:encoded>

alt="bvs" width="300" height="188" /></a>When a new blockbuster superhero
film is released, the sometimes several comics series that it is based on
tend to get revamped in order to capitalize on the film’s predicted success –
we can see this in the upcoming <em>Captain America: Civil War</em> (with
Marvel now releasing the summer crossover event <em>Civil War II</em>), but
we’ve seen it again and again in origin stories that are revisited and
reworked in order to potentially capture a new generation of readers. The
newly released <em>Batman v Superman</em> is no exception to this rule, and
while I was expecting an excellent movie I was a little more reluctant to
believe that the accompanying, inevitable Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman
origin redux could be anything more than a predictable rehashing of old dusty
tropes given both characters’ already rich histories.  <a

195x300.jpg" alt="americanaliencover2" width="195" height="300" /></a>This is
why Max Landis’ seven issue mini-series <em>Superman: American Alien</em>,
which is still being serialized at the time of this posting, caught me so off
guard. Max Landis, son of celebrated screenwriter John Landis, typically
writes for film though he admits he has always been a Superman comics’ fan at
heart – the seven vignettes that comprise <em>American Alien</em> had been
germinating since he was a boy, and though he’s had the opportunity to work
on the character in his short film <em>The Death and Return of Superman</em>
and the absolutely stellar<em> Adventures of Superman</em> #14, in which
Superman meets the Joker for the first time (read it if you can find it), in
<em>American Alien</em> he’s been allowed to cut loose and rework the
character, outside of continuity, in ways that are touching, innovative, and
which interestingly bear particular hallmarks of writers who work across
different media – mainly by breaking the fourth wall to acknowledge the
medium itself.  That he reworks Superman’s past isn’t really new, as every
writer wants to put his or her stamp on Beyond poignant events in Clark
Kent’s life that span his boyhood to his adulthood – it’s that he does so
while providing a metacommentary on what the writer’s process is when given
this kind of task and the impact that it can have. In issue #1, young Clark
Kent, speaking to his father about breaking a mirror in a movie theatre out
of frustration, reflects:  Somebody had to make [the mirror], like, somebody
at the factory took time to make it. Then somebody had to sell it to the
movie theater and then other people had to fit it to the wall… which somebody
else built before them… When you break something, you’re not just breaking
the thing, you’re like… hurting everyone who ever made it the way it was.

195x300.jpg" alt="americanalien_3" width="195" height="300" /></a>While this
is a significant moment for Clark in learning to respect all life and
property in a nigh Buddhist insight, it doubles as a reflection of how
important it is for a writer to handle a character respectfully, particularly
when so many people have had their hands on him over the decades. This is a
theme that Landis repeats throughout the series in dialogue that is so subtle
it’s sometimes hard to catch – the second issue opens with Lana Lang, Clark’s
first Smallville girlfriend, studying French with Clark and asking him
“<em>pouvez-vous me montrer le chemin du retour</em>?” which is glossed in
the issue as “can you show me the way home?” With no context to set the scene
(it’s the first line of dialogue for the issue) and Clark being unable to
understand the basic sentence, it’s clear that this is meant solely for the
benefit of the reader to have some insight into the process of reworking an
important origin – Landis’ own invoking of the muse, so to speak, to make
sure that he gets it right by asking the character outright for guidance.
This may seem a stretch, but interviews with Landis point to the fact that
there’s more at work here than your typical superhero story, saying of the
series that it’s meant more as a “tone poem” than a straightforward
narrative, focusing in on Clark’s story because “Superman has been written by
some of the greatest minds in comics” (Landis). Where does the individual
author fit into this paradigm? How does one assert one’s own voice, and
should he?  This motif reaches a crescendo on the final page of issue #3 with
another aside for the reader, here a single page story that has nothing to do
with the preceding narrative and that is just dropped in, apropos nothing.
Landis has Mr. Mxyzptlk, an absurdist comedic villain from Superman’s rogues’
gallery, address the reader directly by asking us “who’s more real? You or
me? … I was created as a character in 1944. Think about that. Millions of
people have known my name … Oh, I suppose I don’t have a physical body in the
same way you do. But does that make me any less real?” (24). Similar themes
have been explored by Grant Morrison when he repeatedly broke the fourth wall
in <em>Animal Man </em>and the more recent <em>Multiversity</em>, and Gaiman
touches on the topic in <em>Sandman</em> as well though in a subtler way –
Landis, given a mini-series, simply doesn’t have the page count for that kind
of nuance and so is throwing some often heavy punches in showing us the
importance of handling rich histories and of creating something that can
outlast ourselves. Just as Landis has Clark fret over his role and legacy in
every issue, so should we in writing our own stories and participating in
ways that stretch beyond our selves, perhaps making sure that we also get it
right the first - and only - time around.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Superman-1.jpg"><img

jpg" alt="Superman 1" width="238" height="300" /></a>Origin stories are
important, and Landis clearly respects the process to the point of baring his
anxieties to his readers – where he moves beyond the traditional retelling is
in showing us that what at first appears as a mosaic in a multi-authored
character is actually a continuum, regardless of which medium one is writing
in and what motivations caused a particular story to be told at that specific
cultural moment. I’m anxiously awaiting the final issues, as <em>American
Alien</em> is a probing insight into process rather than content, one that
comes as a highly welcome surprise from the unlikely place of the compulsory
reboot.  &nbsp;  Works Cited  Landis, Max. Alienating a Hero: Max Landis

alt="Image" width="1024" height="576" /></a>Somewhere in the haze of
finishing my PhD I submitted to the CFP from the <a
href="http://comics-scholars.com/wp/" target="_blank">Canadian Society for
the Study of Comics/Société Canadienne pour l’étude de la Bande Dessinée
(CSSC/SCEBD)</a> (I included the French because it makes me feel fancy). I
was delighted when my proposal was accepted and even more overjoyed when I
saw that there were not one but two other papers about Québécois Comics
scheduled for the event. What a perfect way to celebrate the end of my PhD in
Canadian Studies, a trip to Canada.  It was only my second international (to
me) conference (the last one was the Graphixia extravaganza in 2013) and so
it was somewhat nervously that I set about preparing. I arrived in Toronto a
few days ahead of the event and spent the week being the most gleeful tourist
you could possibly imagine. “Oh my god, Toronto is enormous!” “Did you see
that Racoon?” “Is a Canada bumbag really a bad fashion choice?”. But on
Thursday morning it was time to get my comics scholar on.  The programme
allowed for a very civilized 11:00 am start and so I headed downtown to the
Marriott conference suite and we plunged straight into the first panels of
the day. I opted for ‘The Comics Body’ and was treated to three really
interesting papers. Ariela Freedman spoke about <em>The Comics Body in
Pain</em> and her discussion of pain scales and how comics might be used to
represent pain more effectively was fascinating. I’m a big fan of Genevieve
Castrée and so Jonathan Chau’s paper on <em>Transmitting Affect in
Susceptible</em> was slap bang in the middle of my wheelhouse. Meanwhile
Taryn Mahoney’s discussion of <em>Illustrated Autobiographies of the Wimmen’s
Comix Collective</em> plunged me into an area I know little about and now
have a reading list a mile long for!  After a restorative lunch break I
decided to stretch my French muscles a bit and attend the two Francophone
panels that afternoon. First up was one of the papers on Québécois Bande
Dessinée by Sylvain Lemay. Lemay’s own BD <em>Pour en finir avec
Novembre</em> is one of my favourite books of recent years and he has a new
book out with Mem9ire on the influential Chiendent group so I was really
excited to hear his paper about the Springtime of Québécois Bande Dessinée.
Next up was Hales Latifa with a really interesting and detailed account of
her experiences using comics as a teaching resource in the classroom. Finally
Pierre Dairon addressed a wide range of accounts of childhood in francophone
graphic novels.  The following panel was on Africa in Bande Dessinée and it
consisted of two papers. The first by Kevin Pat Fong was <em>L’identité
raciale dans Blacksad de Juan Diaz Canales et Juanjo Guarnido</em>, this
wasn’t a book I knew at all and it was really interesting that Kevin brought
a copy with him for us to look at. The second paper, by Leslie Goufo Zemmo,
was an utterly fascinating discussion of <em>Representations des sujets dans
la Bande dessinée Africaine: le cas des sujets feminins</em>.  The final
panel of the day mean that it was my turn to present and I won’t bore you
with an account of that. However, I was lucky enough to be on the ‘Regions,
Nations and Movements’ panel and so got to see Kent Allin talking about his
experiences using First Nations, Metis and Inuit comics in the High School
classroom. I also shared the panel with Julian Peters who was discussing
<em>The Chiendent Comics Collective and the Quebec Pop Art Movement,
1968-1969</em> the second of the papers about Québécois Comics that I was so
happy to see! (BDQ 4 EVA &lt;3!)  Day Two dawned bright and early with the
conference’s keynote delivered by the super Ryan North. Taking place in the
Toronto Reference Library, which I instantly fell in love with, the talk was
a whistlestop tour of the history of comics, the word balloon all with a dash
of timetravel and even some Dinosaur Comics. Ryan is a thoroughly
entertaining speaker and this was the perfect way to start the day.  Lest
this post just become a shopping list of papers I saw, a shopping list where
I run out of adjectives because I had such a blast and loved everything, I am
just going to pick a couple of highlights from the day to share with you all.
 The Gender and the Superhero panel was always going to be interesting to me
but I particularly enjoyed Neta Gordon’s discussion of Darwyn Cooke’s <em>DC:
The New Frontier</em> and Christine Atchison’s <em>Auteurism, Gender and
Female Heroics</em> in which she addressed the seeming reluctance of the
comics industry to allow women to write major women superheroes. The other
panel of the day that I particularly relished was entitled The Narrative
Burden. Jean Braithwaite offered a compelling case as to why Chris Ware’s
<em>Building Stories</em> only makes sense if there is another extradiagetic
objective narrator. Next Kalervo Sinervo and Natalie Walschots discussed
<em>Narrative (Un)Reliability and Believing Victims in Vaughn and Staples’
‘Saga’</em>, which made me want to go and reread <em>Saga</em> and think
about it very hard indeed. Finally Jessica Fontaine’s <em>Hello I’m Johnny
Cash, Visualizing Cash’s Songs in Reinhard Klein’s ‘Johnny Cash: I see a
Darkness’</em> rounded off my Comics Shopping List nicely!  I unfortunately
had to leave town before TCAF proper started, I’m going to add that to my
Holiday Wishlist for next year, but two days of CSSC/SCEBD has thoroughly
reignited my Comics Studies brain from his post-PhD exhausted slump and I am
buzzing with thoughts, ideas and new research plans. Thank you so much to the
organisers and my fellow presenters and attendees. What a thoroughly
delightful conference!  (You can check out tweets from the event <a

there was no WiFi at the venue so opportunities to tweet were
limited.)]]></content:encoded>

2013 <strong></strong> <h1><strong>Smoo Day</strong></h1> by Peter Wilkins

	I have a paper to finish revising, numerous work projects to develop, and
I desperately need a nap. But the stars have aligned in such a way today that
I must spend a half an hour or so writing about Simon Moreton’s <em>Smoo
Comics</em>.

	This morning <em>Smoo</em> received a positive write-up in Rob Clough’s
“<a title="minicomics of note" href="http://www.tcj.com/minicomics-of-note/"
target="_blank">Minicomics of Note</a>” column in <em>The Comics
Journal</em>. Also this morning, Nicolas Pillai, a fellow <em>Comics
Grid</em> contributor whom I follow on Twitter, tweeted that he had received
his first issue of his <em>Smoo</em> subscription, which made me wonder where
mine was. Lo and behold, this afternoon, a neat packet of <em>Smoo
Comics</em> arrived in the post.

	If you follow <a title="smoo tumblr" href="http://smoo.tumblr.com/"
target="_blank">Simon on Tumblr</a>, you know what they look like. Clough
gets the “less is more” aesthetic pretty much right. Moreton’s drawings are
about getting as much information and affect into as few lines as possible.
It would not only be a cliche but incorrect to say that we “fill in the rest”
with our imaginations. Rather, I think Moreton makes us cling to to the
partial images he gives us of a place or a memory and look at them really
intensely, because the parts we can’t see have a sublime quality that plays
off of the beauty and elegance of the drawings.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/smoo_002.jpeg"><img
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2389" title="smoo_002"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/smoo_002-740x1024.
jpeg" alt="" width="740" height="1024" /></a>

	My favourite piece is “Routines” in issue 6. It depicts a walk through an
urban landscape and reflects on the loss of magic in everyday life. The
minimalism of the drawings, which threaten a kind of invisibility and
anonymity, evoke magic at the same time: the girl with her headphones, the
empty speech bubbles that float like balloons.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/smoo_001-2.jpeg"><
img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2384" title="smoo_001 2"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/smoo_001-2-1024x718.
jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="718" /></a>

	When my ten-year-old daughter arrived home from school, I showed her the
comics because she is an avid artist. I asked her what she thought. “They
aren’t very comicky,” she said. “Why not?” “The drawings aren’t in boxes.”
“These ones are.” “Oh…I don’t know. The drawing is very good, I just think
maybe he shouldn’t call them comics.”

	Of course, <em>Smoo Comics</em> are comics. It says so on the front. But
my daughter has a point about them not being “comicky.” In that sense, they
remind me of <a title="Oliver East"
href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2012/12/04/96-human-geography-oliver-
easts-trains-are-mint/" target="_blank">Oliver East’s work that I have
written about in an earlier post</a>. Moreton and East are artists using the
medium of comics to evoke something about time and place in an “uncomicky”
way.

	If you read this post, Simon, congratulations on an excellent Thursday.

	Thursday, February 13, 2013 <strong>Owly and Wormy Teach Us to
Read</strong> <strong>A recent trip to that icon of comicshops <a
href="http://www.beguilingbooksandart.com/">The Beguiling</a> in Toronto and
its sister store <a href="http://www.littleislandcomics.com/sample-page/"
target="_blank">Little Island Comics</a>—apparently North America’s first
comicshop for kids—introduced me to the books of <a
href="http://www.amazon.ca/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=
390961&amp;field-author=Andy%20Runton&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;search-alias=books
-ca&amp;tag=thedigcullab-20">Andy Runton</a>. He writes / draws a fantastic
series called <a href="&lt;a href=">Owly &amp; Wormy</a>. The books contain
virtually no words, instead relying on a sequence of events and the
character’s expressionism to carry the story forward.</strong>

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-2.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2338" title="photo 2"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-2-225x300.png"
alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>

	The books struck me immediately as an example of something Peter and I
have been pushing for some time: the argument that comics require an
education in reading as much as text does, maybe even moreso. What Runton’s
books also make apparent is how reading is, at its base, a creative activity;
reading is generative.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-3.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2339" title="photo 3"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-3-225x300.png"
alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>

	While the basic narrative of the Owly and Wormy books would be the same
for everyone, the intricacies of the story would not. Runton’s books force
the reader of his books to both interpret and create what’s on the page. When
I read the books to my two-year-old, I have to come up with the words. When
my five-year-old reads the book without me, he comes up with an entirely
different set of words and emotions to go with the image sequence. Everything
is in play: the white space is there to be filled. What’s amazing about the
way one encounters Runton’s books is the manner in which we write the story
based on the pictures.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-4.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2340" title="photo 4"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-4-225x300.png"
alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>

	Reading Runton means reading for signs of character emotion, clues for
sequence, and generally interpreting what images Runton has put down on the
page. However, reading here also involves making decisions about what
language might be added to describe, augment, and accelerate the sequence of
images that form the story. There are spaces where language is needed, but
not always. Runton’s books really make you account for the silences in comics
and for the amount of work an image can do on its own, without language.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-7.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2341" title="photo 7"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-7-225x300.png"
alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>

	The value in Runton’s books is in how they teach us how to read and make
reading into a self-reflective practice. What becomes apparent is how
valuable comics are in teaching people the skills needed to read with depth.
By making reading into both an interpretive and a creative act (both
occurring at the same time even), Runton forces us to engage with the page in
a way we often avoid.

	<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-8.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2342" title="photo 8"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-8-225x300.png"
alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>

	Runton makes us better readers. Comics make us better readers. The amount
of work that goes into interpreting and creating Runton’s work is in some
ways ruined by the imposition of language. Where language and text tend to
lock down interpretation, images merely rein it in a little; the image
doesn’t signify pure abstraction, it <em>is</em> something, but the
intricacies of what it signifies are left to the able
reader.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Jack Kirby’s writing
came in for a lot of criticism in the 1970s after he made the break from
Marvel to DC. And as time has gone on, Kirby’s dialogue can increasingly be
read as stilted in an age where “believable” or, failing that, witty
interchange between characters is much prized. He is out of step with how
culture has gone because he is so earnest in his writing.

	Due to their great success in the 1960s at Marvel, which was credited to
Stan Lee as writer and Kirby as artist, it is tempting to look at those
comics, compare them to Kirby’s later work, and subtract the difference as
being Lee’s contribution. There is much debate about who exactly was
responsible for what though, as Gerard Jones states: <blockquote> “Stan
turned to Jack Kirby and through a process now eternally obscured by
competing stories – both men claimed to have had all the basic ideas first –
introduced Fantastic Four” <i>(a)</i></blockquote> Traditional notions of
what a writer and an illustrator do are surely too simplistic when applied to
these comics, as recounted by Ronin Ro: <blockquote> “When Stan saw the
Surfer in his pages, he asked ‘Who the hell’s this?’ ‘I figured anybody as
powerful as Galactus ought to have a herald who would go ahead of him and
find planets,’ Jack replied. ‘That’s a great idea!’” <i>(b)</i></blockquote>
Leaving aside the thorny issue of what exactly is meant by writer in these
credits, amongst what one might assume to be the Lee contribution is snappy
banter between characters, witty and self-knowing asides, and a more general
showman/ringmaster persona that he brought to the editorial side of his work.

	This leaves Kirby with imaginative design in characters and environments,
dramatic pacing, and a smaller or greater element of the plot, depending on
how detailed the initial instruction from Lee was.

	By the time Kirby is doing the writing and drawing at DC, the imaginative
characters, locations and plots are intact (arguably even more so), and the
action and story progression is still very dynamic. What has been lost is a
street level, smart-talking point of entry. Lee’s writing was done in
reaction to Kirby’s artwork. In a sense he was commenting on what Kirby had
created in the artwork.

	Kirby was always interested in creating new characters, situations and
environments. In the late 60s, he proposed his New Gods ideas to Marvel, who
didn’t want to use them. He took them to rivals DC instead.

	Kirby often used Gods, or variations on powerful celestial beings, in his
stories. His contention that he, and not Lee, came up with the idea to do
comics based on Norse mythology gains credence from the fact that Kirby had
already done a version of Thor at DC in 1957 before doing it for Marvel in
1962.

	<b></b>Kirby was interested in technology, machinery, and philosophy. But
anyone who thinks Kirby could not deliver on an emotional level would be
mistaken. Just look at this one panel from Mister Miracle …

	It’s melodramatic, but even without any context, you have the sense of
what Oberon (on the left) is feeling in this picture.

	When Kirby returned to Marvel in the mid 70s, his contract afforded him
the opportunity to officially write, draw and edit his own books, a condition
that Lee was willing to capitulate to in order to get Kirby back. He set to
work on Eternals…

	<a

	<b>IMAGE: Kirby Eternals, Marvel Comics, 1976</b>

	Kirby was keen to create more new stories, characters, and situations, in
opposition to what had become the Marvel norm, whereby all the comics fed
into each other to varying extents (all characters in Marvel Comics  had to
meet Spider-Man at some point, be they Howard the Duck, Transformers, or the
Frankenstein monster).  Kirby did not want to create stories that had to
negotiate the convoluted continuity of twenty or so years of previously
published comics. As Sean Howe writes, <blockquote>“In Captain America,
assistant editor Roger Stern had to rewrite a Kirby reference to a flying
saucer being “the first alien space craft ever to visit the Earth, “ a
description that would discount scores of Marvel adventures and not a few of
the characters.” <i>(c)</i></blockquote> I only later read any of the
background on Kirby’s self-penned comics. Summing up the industry view of him
at this point, Mark Evanier writes: <blockquote>“Just then, he’d stopped
being Jack Kirby, the guy who created, or co-created, so many successful new
comics. With the end of his contract in sight, he was Jack Kirby, the guy who
did those wonky, unreadable books that didn’t sell so
great.”<i>(d)</i></blockquote> Evanier also writes: <blockquote> “Years
after, his seventies work would be regarded more favourably, and even
reprinted, right along with everything else he did, time and again. Some
would even say the sales figures weren’t as dour as the rumours of the times
insisted”. <i>(d)</i></blockquote> Anecdotally, I bought and read them.
Perhaps there is a generational element to one’s appreciation of Kirby’s
writing. The late 1970s Captain America was actually the first comics I read
by Kirby, and I thought they were terrific as a kid. Instead of the wry,
slightly arch dialogue of Lee though, in Kirby’s self-scripted comics we
instead have an earnest, almost poetic series of statements. These are
sentences that no-one has ever said or ever will say. They are not capturing
a realistic conversational tone. They are lines which aspire to be about the
magical, the fantastic, the wonderful. In this respect they are more in tune
with the artwork. The totality of the comic is now Jack Kirby.

	<strong>Postscript:</strong>

	Incidentally, although Kirby’s dialogue and writing is unique, another
writer whose work reminds me of him is Ann Nocenti. In Longshot she is also
operating in a similarly fantastical environment filled with outlandish
characters. See this following discourse…

Representations of the Regional in Francophone Comics</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;  <span
style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, as part of Graphixia #229, </span><a
href="http://graphixia.ca/comicsandmassmedia/2016/03/26/becassine-goes-to-the
-movies-who-is-adaptation-for-anyway/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I
wrote about adaptations of the French comic series </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Les Aventures de Bécassine</span></i></a> <span
style="font-weight: 400;">and the various problems that arose when filmmakers
attempted to adapt comics depicting a culture and community without any
attempt to engage with that community, Perhaps unsurprisingly, it didn’t go
well. Consider the following a companion piece, the flipside of my
contribution to #229: what happens when communities use comics to represent
themselves? </span>  &nbsp;  <span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a
sizeable corpus of French comics  (</span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">bandes dessinées, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BD) which
depict France’s many regional cultures. Oftentimes these representations can
be varying levels of problematic, particularly if those comics are written
for a mainstream market by people with little knowledge of the local cultures
they depict. Instead the representations are based on received ideas and
stereotypes passed down through years of deliberate political and cultural
centralisation during which the French state purposefully neglected and
suppressed any language or culture which was not (standard, Parisian,
culturally elite) French. (As a very rough guide to France’s historical
attitude towards minority culture, I particularly enjoyed the </span><a
href="http://i.imgur.com/6YyGXCd.png"><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Polandball Guide To Minority Languages</span></i></a><span
style="font-weight: 400;">). We could call this the Bécassine effect, where
people in positions of relative power-- in this case, major BD publishers--
create approximations of less-privileged cultures for the benefit of
mainstream audiences, feeding back into a pre-existing cultural tendency to
delegitimize minority cultures and then recast them as folkloric,
picturesque, special, but above all different. Useful for entertainment, very
pretty certainly, how very </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">interesting-- </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">but always the
Other, always Not Us. </span>  &nbsp;  <span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Home
grown”  BD attempting to show authentic regional cultures aren’t especially
new--I have found occasional examples dating from 1940 onwards-- but there
have been a number of particularly interesting works published in the last
decade or so which offer new representations of regional cultures, in overt
challenge to pre-existing ideas and tropes. Brittany and Corsica, in the far
west and the Mediterranean respectively, have both been subject to the
aforementioned stereotypical representations, and both regions are being
depicted in  a growing body of comics which rejects and recasts those
stereotypes.  The move towards new visions of the French periphery is not a
concerted effort; in some cases the effort is deliberately ideological and in
others, ideology is mostly absent. The following is an overview of some of
these new representations of Brittany and Corsica, and why they
matter.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Overt Rejections</b>  &nbsp;  <span
style="font-weight: 400;">When researching for my PhD, I was looking for
comics about Corsica when I came across the local publisher</span><a
href="http://www.editionsdcl.fr/index.php/bande-dessin%C3%A9e-c-21"><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> Distribution Corse du Livre (DCL).</span></a><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> After reading a pile of comics from major
publishing houses which traded in the same Corsican stereotypes (‘everyone is
really insular and unwelcoming’, ‘bombs go off all the time’; ‘everybody is
part of the Corsican independence movement’; ‘everyone wears a balaclava at
all times’) I read a few DCL comics, which are all by one Corsican writer and
a revolving collection of non-Corsican artists, and realised that the pile I
had just read were </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">entirely free of
Corsican stereotypes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Absent were
identikit figures in balaclavas habitually laying explosives everywhere; gone
were comically incompetent police, local people who exploded in anger at the
slightest provocation were nowhere to be seen. Instead, what there was were
realistic, detailed stories which very specifically Corsican, but written
universally enough (and published in the standard French comic format of
large hardback volume), as to be accessible to all. They even managed to
publish a thriller series about the </span><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_of_Corsica"><
span style="font-weight: 400;">FLNC’</span></a><span style="font-weight:
400;">s links  with the IRA with minimal levels of bombing and balaclavas.
The majority of their other comics available at the time were based on
Corsican historical events and figures: a three-volume series on the life of
</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasquale_Paoli"><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Pasquale Paoli</span></a><span style="font-weight:
400;">, a diptych about </span><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampiero_Corso"><span style="font-weight:
400;">Sampiero Corso</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a retelling
of the events that are said to have radicalised Corsica’s separatist violence
at </span><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsican_nationalism#The_Al.C3.
A9ria_incident_and_the_birth_of_the_FLNC"><span style="font-weight:
400;">Aléria</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in 1975.  DCL’s
historical output is an example of overt rejection of mainstream comics’
received ideas about regional culture; when interviewed for my thesis, the
writer Frédéric Bertocchini noted that his work for DCL is conceived as a
direct response to the way Corsica is depicted by larger French comics
publishers; a way to present a different version of Corsica. It is worth
noting that DCL’s work has had a considerable impact, particularly in Corsica
itself, where the comics sell consistently well: </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Paoli </span></i><span style="font-weight:
400;">alone has sold over 30,000 copies in both the French and Corsican.
languages  </span>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/aleria-page.jpg"><
img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4750"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/aleria-page.jpg"
alt="aleria page" width="584" height="807" /></a>  <span style="font-weight:
400;">The work of Delphine le Lay and Alex Horellou on Brittany functions in
much the same way. Their graphic novel </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Plogoff </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(2012) is a
retelling of the large-scale anti-nuclear protests that took place in western
Brittany from the mid-1970s to early 1980s in the eponymous commune, near to
which the French government planned to build a new nuclear power plant. The
Plogoff protests were a definitive moment for the post-war Breton cultural
movement, just as Aléria was for Corsica.  Both works constitute a move
towards more representation of significant, </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">actual</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">
regional cultures and history, in opposition to idealised folkloric versions.
Both </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aleria 1975 </span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Plogoff</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are well-researched:
the former is based on interviews with militants who were part of events at
Aléria, and uses dialogue and images from contemporary news reports, while
the latter includes a useful bibliography of works about the protests,
including the documentary film </span><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCt8Pz5THPM"><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Plogoff, des pierres contre des
fusils</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The creators of the
film  also provide the book’s foreword.</span>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/plogoff-page.jpg"><
img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4752"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/plogoff-page.jpg"
alt="plogoff page" width="650" height="905" /></a>  <span style="font-weight:
400;">Le Lay and Horellou’s 2014 comic </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">100 Maisons: La Cité des Abeilles,</span></i><span style="font-weight:
400;"> is also based on the true story of a Breton social movement, in this
case a collectively-built alternative to slum housing in 1950s Quimper.
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">100 Maisons </span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">is particularly important because it is set in
urban Brittany, an environment that is not often seen in comics depicting the
region. Since many stereotypical markers of ‘Breton-ness’ are ‘traditional’
and rural (dramatic cliffs, standing stones, women in traditional dress, pipe
bands), removing the action from a rural setting also removes the potential
for stereotypical representation and forces a reconsideration on the part of
the reader.</span>  &nbsp;  <a

alt="100 maisons page" width="496" height="686" /></a>  &nbsp; 
<b>Repositionings</b>  &nbsp;  <span style="font-weight: 400;">As well as
works which deliberately disrupt conventional narratives of the French
periphery, there are a number of works which challenge mainstream
representations in a more nuanced way. For example, two recent works by Weber
and Nicoby, a Belgian writer and a Breton artist respectively.
 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ouessantines </span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">(2014)</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belle-Île en Père </span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">(2015), are set on what we might call the periphery
of the periphery- small islands off the Breton coast. While these works do
contain more stereotypical markers of Bretonness -- both are set in insular
communities with distinctly ‘Breton’ features, and the publisher reinforces
the folkloric remoteness of the narratives in the books’ advertising,
underlining the ‘wild and lonely’ settings ‘at the end of the world’-- both
books’ narratives extend beyond picturesque depictions into more interesting
territory. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ouessantines’
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">protagonist is attempting to
reconfigure her life by moving to the island of Ushant alone to open a
guesthouse, but finds integration harder than expected; </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Belle-Île en Père </span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">deals with issues of identity and belonging. Both
BDs’ protagonists are Bretonnes, and the setting is an integral part of each
book, but the stories themselves could (theoretically) take place anywhere.
They are not inherently, or ideally, Breton stories; markers of Bretonness
add a dimension but they are not the driving force of the BDs. Contrast this
with the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bécassine </span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">series, for example, where markers of Bretonness
are everywhere, all the time, in the form of the anachronistic,
forever-traditionally-dressed protagonist. Even when set far away from
Brittany, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bécassine
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">stories always  have an emblematic
depiction of ‘Bretonness’ front and centre. Not so for Weber and Nicoby.
These works are important as BD which manage to represent (particular) Breton
societies without stereotypes while also using recognisably Breton visual
cues. They show that it is possible to show a more complex version of
Brittany without completely removing the region’s visual specificity.</span> 
<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ouessantines-page.
jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4751"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ouessantines-page.jpg
" alt="ouessantines page" width="768" height="1016" /></a>  <span
style="font-weight: 400;">All of these works matter because on a basic level,
representation matters. DCL’s work is as much aimed at the community it
depicts as it is aimed outwards, and judging by its popularity amongst
members of the public I interviewed, highly visible, non-hysterical,
realistic representations of Corsica are much appreciated amongst the local
community. And for non-Corsican readers, the works offer an alternative to
humorous depictions of violence that are so often proffered by the
mainstream. Similarly, the events depicted by Le Lay and Horellou,
particularly in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plogoff,
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are defining moments for Brittany
in general, but are overtaken in the wider popular culture by centuries-old
ideas of Breton society which no longer, and in many cases never did apply.
Le Lay and Horellou’s work directly challenges these ideas. Weber and Nicoby
may make less radical representations of their chosen region, but their BDs
are equally as important-- not least for the fact that the Breton islands
shown so vividly are even less understood in the French popular consciousness
than the mainland periphery. Expansion of the francophone comic medium to
include complex representations of communities often marginalised in that
medium can only be a good thing, and it is one that continues apace.</span>

<title>#236 Comics and Postcapitalism: Let’s Get Utopian!</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week I gave notice
to my university that I intend to submit my thesis, so it’s now the final
countdown for me. I’m not freaking out. Not at all.  As it’s an open theme
for this round of Graphixia posts, I thought I’d share a little bit of what I
talk about in the final chapter of my thesis. This chapter focuses on
contemporary political economy, contextualising Anglo-American alternative
comics within the recent shifts towards what is referred to variously as the
“information economy,” “knowledge economy,” “sharing economy” and “network
economy.” These terms all mean slightly different things, of course, but all
hint at the same basic transformation: from an economy based on industry,
manufacturing and material goods to one based on networks and digital
objects. If you’ve read my work before, you’ll know that I like to relate
everything back to neoliberalism, and this chapter is no exception.  In the
chapter, I argue that neoliberalism (in a very small and gnarly nutshell, the
philosophy behind late capitalism that values the entrepreneurial self above
all else) has coincided with the growth of freely available knowledge and
accelerated technical advances to put downward pressure on wages and to make
work more precarious. This won’t be news to anyone, I’m sure, especially as
the word ‘precariat’ <a
href="http://www.policy-network.net/pno_detail.aspx?ID=4004&amp;title=+The+
Precariat+%E2%80%93+The+new+dangerous+class">has been coined</a> to describe
exactly this situation, but it gets interesting when you think about two
things – where political economy is headed, broadly speaking, and how the
creation of art such as comics fits in to this vision of the future.  This is
where the concept of Postcapitalism comes in. It’s still an emergent and
growing movement, but it’s one that seeks to address the possibility that
capitalism’s dominance over western political economy is coming to an end, as
its ability to provide economic growth and to meaningfully improve society
for the common good is stagnating. This point is up for debate, of course,
but the postcapitalists argue for it convincingly. They tie it to a vision of
the future that echoes some of the conjectures of influential economic
thinkers such as John Maynard Keynes and John Stuart Mill, who suggested that
the time spent at work would decrease with technological advance.
Postcapitalism, at least in the books I’ve read (listed at the bottom of this
post), advocates for a move towards not just a reduction in working hours,
but a reduction in work itself, combined with increases in the automation of
things and a huge growth in infrastructure and welfare, usually including the
idea of a UBI (Universal Basic Income).  It’s easy to deride this kind of
thinking as unworkable and impossibly naive utopianism. However, many of the
books on the subject such as Paul Mason’s <em>Postcapitalism: A Guide to our
Future</em> make sensible predictions about how a UBI might be funded and how
society might be structured if work was not a requirement to achieve a basic
standard of living. The essential thing, for the purposes of a blog post like
this, is to consider the idea of separating work from income and thus
separating art from commerce. This begs the question of what the comics art
world would look like if comics art could be separated from work in this way.
 Throughout my thesis I discuss the portrayal of alternative cartoonists by
alternative cartoonists, which is often negative, focusing on the precarious
conditions in which they find themselves and spouting self-involved solipsism
that, it can be argued, stems from the prevailing neoliberal focus on the
self. One of the most obvious examples of this hyperbolic negativity is found
in Chris Ware’s ACME Novelty Library, a page of which depicts an ironic
full-page false advert for a career in comics (pictured below; click image to
view the enlarged version). This advert warns the budding cartoonist that
they will doom themselves to years of backbreaking labour, social disregard
and crippling self-doubt, but most significantly that they will not be
compensated and will end up living in poverty.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ruin-Your-Life.jpg">
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4769"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ruin-Your-Life-
749x1024.jpg" alt="Ruin Your Life" width="400" height="547" /></a>  Should
the prevailing political economy undergo the seismic shift the
postcapitalists are fighting for and offer every citizen an income and a
basic standard living unconditionally, much of this assessment of comics work
would become irrelevant. The cultural perception of comics (i.e. the
misunderstanding of comics as a genre instead of medium, the idea of them
being a lowbrow art form, etc) might take longer to change, but this change
would likely be facilitated by first-rate comics work, produced in conditions
of security rather than precarity. Whether the comics artist is being
compensated or not would cease to be relevant, and thus their comic art could
be created irrespective of economic conditions.  It’s impossible to know
exactly what such a change could mean for comics, and I hope to be able to
explore this more in future projects, building on the work I’ve done on this
in my thesis. It’s undeniably utopian to imagine separating art and commerce,
of course, and it wouldn’t be without its numerous complications and
resistances (Paul Mason is frequently dismissed as “unhinged” by the
conservative press in the UK, for example). But I dream of a world where we
can create comics without commercial imperative sometimes, and it seems like
there are more and more economists writing books that suggest this dream
could become a reality in the distant future. I think that’s exciting.  So in
short: end capitalism, comics flourish. BOOM.  <a

300x221.jpg" alt="obama-mic-drop" width="300" height="221" /></a>  As an
aside, or epilogue to this post: Peter Wilkins suggested that I should write
about the recent developments with my comics publishing collective, <a
href="http://twitter.com/good_comics">Good Comics</a>, in this post. However,
I couldn’t think of a suitable angle to take that would make it appropriate
for an academic blog post. So all I’ll say is that Good Comics has a new
zine, Dead Singers Society 2, coming out next week. Do buy it from <a
href="http://goodshop.bigcartel.com/">our online store</a> once it’s up
there, as proceeds will go directly towards my intervention in the
destruction of late capitalism and the ongoing growth of the postcapitalist
project. In other words, you’ll be <a

<title>#237 Draw Comics! A Very Brief Archeology of (Fake) Cartooning
Ads</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:
justify;">I should start by thanking Paddy for reminding me, in <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/2016/05/236/">his post</a>, of that wonderful
“ironic full-page false advert for a career in comics” in Chris Ware's
<em>ACME Novelty Library </em>collection. It got me thinking about the
genealogies that Ware ironically recovers in this fake advert, consistent
with the whole project of his periodical. And so, in this post, I will try to
retrace something of an archeology of ‘cartooning ads’ starting from the ACME
Novelty Library and digging down to the ACME Drawing School. Doing so also
invited me to dig into the layers of the <em>Graphixia</em> archive, as my
searches led me back to David's early (#19!) post “<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/2011/04/327/">Advertising Narratives</a>.”
David was out to analyze how the liminal spaces of the comic book relate to
the narrative, to see “whether or not advertising plays a part in the
narrative sequence of the comic book.”</p> <p style="text-align:
justify;">Following in on this interest for what lies in the margins of
comics, my focus will be slightly different as I will focus on one specific
ad: the ‘cartooning ad’ often showcasing the perks and benefits that drawing
can afford you – if you follow the (correspondence) courses and lessons that
are generally being advertised.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cartoon-ad-02a.jpg">
<img class="size-full wp-image-4806 aligncenter"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cartoon-ad-02a.jpg"
alt="cartoon-ad-02a" width="720" height="403" /></a></p> <p
style="text-align: justify;">In an ironical and frankly bleak tone (but not
so far from what it actually is about, as Paddy reminds us), Chris Ware
characterizes comics as an isolating, crushing, time-intensive labor offering
no ‘rewards’ whatsoever, whether they be financial or symbolic. Drawing
cartoons equates ‘ruining your life’ and ‘dooming yourself to decades of
grinding.’ Spinning on the advertising of cartooning as a profession with
secrets and tricks of the trade that the apprentice has to come to master,
the false ad rather serves as a disclaimer for the social alienation of the
cartoonist and the grinding labor the form requires.</p> <p
style="text-align: justify;">As <a
href="https://comicsforum.org/2011/08/08/the-joy-and-the-burden-of-the-comics
-artist-the-role-of-boredom-in-the-production-of-comics-by-greice-schneider/"
>Greice Schneider</a> has observed, much of comics work is repetitive in its
make-up and, as a result, can end up being pretty boring, as multiple
cartoonists (Chris Ware included, of course) have described their practice in
melancholic overtones: there is something in the multiple stages of
traditional cartooning  (from pitching and sketching, to layouting,
pencilling, inking, coloring and xeroxing), when taken up by a single author,
that leads to a sort of boredom and melancholia. This idea of cartooning as a
profession with its own tricks and methods is played with by Ware in the
concise how-to-draw comics that circle around the panels.</p> <p
style="text-align: justify;">The whole style of the comic is itself designed
like those well-known how-to manuals that teach you to draw based on a set of
basic circles, facial expressions, featuring  the usual material notices and
all the apparent codes of that specific genre. In fact, the rounded figures
are simultaneously part of Ware's varied stylistic palette as he uses this
graphic approach in most of the ironic gags that feature in the fringes and
margins of his <em>ACME Novelty Library</em>. Any reader familiar with Ware's
work will switch on a particular mode of reading to approach comics drawn in
that particular style. Parodying the idea that making comics is a mere trick
to learn, Ware draws out a bleak portrait of the profession, undercutting the
cheerful success stories in early twentieth-century adverts.</p> <p
style="text-align: justify;"><a
href="http://www.upress.state.ms.us/books/1292">As is known</a>, these fake
ads in the <em>ACME Novelty Library </em>offer parodic counter-narratives to
the modern mood of optimistic consumerism that novelty catalogues tried to
sell: the cartooning ad is no exception as Ware subverts the idea of the
comics artist profession as an American success story. By doing so, he
underlines again the problematic relationship between comics and art, by
stressing once again the debased status of comics: “Ware’s fake ads offer a
way to come to terms with the relationship that exists between the comics
world and the art world, and the structural subordination of the former to
the latter” (Beaty, 212), although, as Beaty argues in the follow-up of his
argument, Ware might not quite manage to challenge traditional hierarchies of
value.</p> <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/crumbwarejuxtapozed.
jpg"><img class="wp-image-4784 aligncenter"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/crumbwarejuxtapozed.
jpg" alt="crumbwarejuxtapozed" width="777" height="518" /></a> <p
style="text-align: justify;">The most direct model – both visually and in
terms of irony – that Ware references in this page is Robert Crumb's famous
fake ad “Drawing Cartoons is Fun!” (from <em>Despair</em>, 1969), in which
the underground comics artist takes up an even more obvious ‘anti-art’
position for which he is renowned, presenting artists as “fakers” and art as
a “racket,” “a HOAX perpetrated on the public by so-called ‘Artists’ who set
themselves up on a pedestal.”</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Retaking
the typical rhetoric of cartooning ads, Crumb makes what seems to be a
half-ironic, half-serious case for comics drawing as something accessible to
anyone: “Anyone can be a cartoonist! It's so simple a child can do it!”
Proposing as exercises to draw cartoon versions of photographic portraits,
Crumb seems to be spinning on the ubiquitous ‘Magic Art Reproducer’ which
particularly stressed that anyone can draw – which in that case, means
duplicating reality – thanks to that ‘amazing invention’: the ads often
involved drawing attractive woman models, an aspect that Crumb turns on its
head. In those ads, drawing is implicitly advertised as a way of getting the
girls and once again, with the old trope of the lone male geek, a form of
“gender melancholia” resurfaces (Worden).</p> <p style="text-align:
justify;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter wp-image-4794 "
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1.jpg" alt="1"
width="392" height="546" /></a></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">But
Crumb's fake ad also seems to point out to a substantial effect that his
work, and underground comix in general, had on the field by pushing forward a
more democractic and less traditional approach to comics drawing that would
refocus the attention from mastering traditional techniques and methods to
expressing a distinct and individual sensibility, from an academic notion of
the beautiful to a notion of personal expression.</p> <p style="text-align:
justify;">Cartoonists of Ware's generation – from Clowes to Seth or Brunetti
– have all stressed the importance of Crumb in altering their view of what
comics were and could be. There is a clear who-cares vibe in Crumb's ads –
after all, “It's only lines on paper, folks!” – that foregrounds freeflowing
expression (which for Crumb will also mean giving free way to the whole
‘repressed’ ideology and stereotypes – with all the political controversies
that go with it) in a way that is very different from Ware's tightly
controlled and time-intensive approach to comics as trying to crystallize and
condense in the drawings a compact sense of existence, memory and perception.
If not through irony, there is no plea for a ‘serious’ legitimization of
comics in the same way that Ware's fake ad bemoans the debased status of
comics. Although Crumb's might be read as parodying the idea of cartooning as
an accessible practice, his work – and underground comix overall – clearly
had a large-scale influence on a whole generation of cartoonists fed on a
do-it-yourself ethos, just as Crumb and his peers themselves were steeped
in the dynamic and collaborative reading practices specific to comics
culture.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">As Jared Gardner repeatedly
shows throughout <a
href="https://books.google.be/books?id=epynqSJYX_wC&amp;redir_esc=y"><em>
Projections</em></a>, comics and comic books have always entailed a
particular investment of their readers throughout the media changes that the
form has undergone, each time reinventing new ways of collaboration depending
on its specific cultural and historical contexts. The comic book was closely
related to science-fiction fandom and quickly encouraged their readers to
start up making comics themselves – a point that Gardner makes by drawing
attention to the cash prizes ad on the insider cover of the first issue of
<em>Action Comics</em>:</p>  <blockquote> <p style="text-align:
justify;">“[Co]mic books from the start necessarily foregrounded their
madeness. For example, the inside cover of the inaugural issue of <em>Action
</em><em>Comics</em>, in which Superman made his first appearance, featured
an open invitation to readers of the comic to pick up a brush and try it
themselves [...]. Since comics could not pretend they were not drawn,
written, colored, they highlighted the work of producing comics and promised
that readers would soon be making comics of their own (‘This is a cinch!’ the
young artist announces in <em>Action Comics</em>). [...] [I]f the Hollywood
dream was that anyone could be discovered at the soda fountain and become a
‘star,’ the dream that comics sold from the start is that anyone could write
back to the comics’ authors and become a ‘creator.’ From early on, it seems,
readers did respond to the invitation” (73-74).</p> <p style="text-align:
justify;"></p> </blockquote> <p style="text-align: justify;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/W0LUsi4.jpg"><img
class="size-full wp-image-4809 aligncenter"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/W0LUsi4.jpg"
alt="W0LUsi4" width="600" height="816" /></a></p> <p style="text-align:
justify;">Such cash prizes and other open invitations to the reader for
participating in the comic were already frequent in the newspaper comic strip
serials of decades prior, as Gardner shows in his analysis of <em>The Gumps
</em>and the way Sidney Smith reused readers’ letters. Cartooning ads often
functioned in similar ways, offering readers a space in the newspaper, as
this prize-winning notice from this 1921 <em>Evening's World</em> comic page
makes clear: readers were encouraged to contribute their own gag of one of
the comic strips, which then appeared in the following week's publication.
This kind of offer created a sense of shared community between creators and
readers that was very much part of a thriving newspaper culture.</p> <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/eveningworldad.jpg">
<img class="size-full wp-image-4817 aligncenter"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/eveningworldad.jpg"
alt="eveningworldad" width="2641" height="3104" /></a> <p style="text-align:
justify;">Besides cash prizes for readers's contribution, it would be hard to
miss the ubiquitous adverts for drawing courses and correspondence school art
courses like the ‘ACME School of Drawing.’ Those ads often foreground ethnic
caricature, racial stereotypes and facial expressions in the selected
drawings: it points both to the multicultural urban settings in which these
newspapers developed, but also to the very idea of stylization,
simplification and caricature as core to cartooning – with the racism that
frequently underpinned it. Comic strips were often the work of migrants and
even more often featured a varied cast of ethnic characters screwballing
around: learning to become a cartoonist, a craft based on caricature and
diagrammatic stylization, was learning to draw ethnic types. (And again,
Chris Ware, both as a comics historian and artist, has repeatedly pointed out
to those ideological aspects).</p> <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cartoon-ads-racist.
jpg"><img class="wp-image-4823 size-full aligncenter"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cartoon-ads-racist.
jpg" alt="cartoon-ads-racist" width="872" height="319" /></a> <p
style="text-align: justify;">An interesting example that mingled advertising
with drawing lessons and comic strip was a recurring full-page by ‘Zim,’
penname of Eugene Zimmerman, drawn for the McClure syndicate in the early
1910s. The page is divided into a half-page ‘course of comic art zim-plified
drawing,’ featuring cut-out exercises to be performed by the reader, while
the other half was a <em>Katzenjammer Kids</em>-like comic strip with two
urchins taking a correspondence art course and messing up everything with
what they learn from it. As <a
href="http://strippersguide.blogspot.be/2009/07/obscurity-of-day-zims-
courselena-undt.html">Alan Holtz</a> remarks, Zim was himself running a
cartooning correspondence school at the same time, making of the whole page
some kind of advertising for that and simultaneously its own parody of the
whole thing (long before Crumb or Ware would take that up).</p> <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/zims.jpg"><img
class="size-large wp-image-4825 aligncenter"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/zims-870x1024.jpg"
alt="zims" width="870" height="1024" /></a> <p style="text-align:
justify;">In a similar blend of comic strip/drawing lesson, another
interesting example is this episodic ‘drawing lesson’ from <em>The
San Francisco Call </em>in 1897: this time, the ‘<a
href="http://pufr-editions.fr/livre/lengendrement-images-en-bande-dessin%C3%
A9e">engendering of the image</a>’ is not only based on the generic
conventions of the drawing lesson, where one learns to trace abstract shapes
and lines into a recognizable and humorous drawing, but also on those of the
chalk talk, in which a performer draws and vocally interacts with his drawing
– the well-known comics example is Winsor McCay of course, but many early
cartoonists toured around doing chalk talks and giving  'chalk-talking
exhibitions’ is one of the abilities that the Ernie's School of Comic Art ad
promised to teach its students. In the case of the anonymous
<em>San Francisco Call </em>lesson, the drawing lesson is itself a gag
playing with the expectations of the reader as each week leaves the abstract
lines and forms unfinished, letting the reader try and fill them out for him-
or herself before giving the ‘solution’ the next week: “The artists are very
sly and they hide their real designs well. So it will pay you to carefully
study the outlines before you say have found them out.” Part-gag, part-comic,
part-chalk talk and part-drawing lesson, the visual sequence there unrolls as
a playful game in which the reader is an active participant.</p> <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/drawinglessons1.jpg"
><img class="size-large wp-image-4829 aligncenter"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/drawinglessons1-
357x1024.jpg" alt="drawinglessons" width="357" height="1024" /></a> <p
style="text-align: justify;">Cartooning ads always foreground drawing as the
fascinating trace of its own creative process, recording the active labor of
the artist or the ‘tricks’ behind the image but always spotlighting the
graphic image as the result of a process that is still perceptible in its
very marks – the ‘<a
href="https://books.google.be/books?id=j_S6QHAov1kC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=
PA147&amp;dq=graphiation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9uBUX4mC5u&amp;sig=
aRfxG6UMsvYIqqEfCoNC8tHPbNo&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrouu-
hIXNAhUlCcAKHWmtDwMQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=graphiation&amp;f=false">
graphiation</a>’ that has mesmerized comics scholars. They also stress
drawing as a ‘democratic’ activity, one that can be taken up by anyone – an
idea that the underground comix helped spread further. Making comics is both
simple and extremely hard, accessible and labor-intensive, but it is a
pleasure that has always been shared and circulated. As Smolderen notes,
“[o]nly a pencil and some paper are necessary to produce a readable and
enjoyable comic strip, but in the age of the movie, the radio, the
television, the computer and the Internet, the form is literally thriving —
the robustness of this deceivingly simple medium in the 20th century is its
most striking historical feature” (Smolderen, 1).</p> <p style="text-align:
justify;">The enduring liveliness and survival of comics in the media ecology
might be linked to the ability of cartoonists to quote and borrow other
graphic styles and visual languages, but also to the collaborative practices
and the openness at the heart of the form. Cartooning ads point out to this
rhetoric that lies in every drawing and urging the reader to take up the
brush in turn. However, as Ware reminds us, we should be wary of adopting the
optimistic tone of the cartooning ads wholesale: ‘making your pen get
dollars’ is a complicated business.</p> &nbsp; <h5><strong>Works

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Editor's Note:
</em>Graphixia<em> is embarking on a series of posts about Kelly Sue
DeConnick and Valentine De Landro's feminist dystopia </em>Bitch Planet<em>,
an excellent but also really important comics series from Image that offers a
feminist reimagining of the women's prison exploitation genre. You should
read it. But you should also be aware that the post that follows, and likely
others in this series, contain spoilers in order to offer full analysis of
the series. If you haven't read </em>Bitch Planet<em>, now is a really good
time -- there's only seven issues out so far! -- and then you can follow
along with the series with us.</em>  The most important page in <em>Bitch
Planet</em>'s run so far -- the page that most clearly represents how and why
this comic changes everything about comics for so many readers -- is not a
narrative page at all. It's the first page of issue #6, "Extraordinary
Machine" (also the name of the trade paperback), a flashback issue that fills
in the backstory of Meiko Maki, a character who has died in the preceding
issue.* The first page of this issue looks like this:  [caption
id="attachment_4837" align="aligncenter" width="385"]<a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-
13-at-2.48.17-PM.png"><img class="wp-image-4837 size-full"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-
13-at-2.48.17-PM.png" alt="The first page of Bitch Planet #7 offers a content
warning for readers." width="385" height="449" /></a> The text above reads:
"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Content Advisory</span>: the
following is a flashback issue, covering the events that led to Meiko Maki's
incarceration. It contains plot elements and images relating to <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">sexual assault</span>. We encourage you
to evaluate your comfort level before deciding to continue. <em>Bitch
Planet</em>'s main narrative will resume next month with Issue 7. The series
recap therein will not recount the assault."[/caption]  The first page of
<i>Bitch Planet</i> #6 is a trigger warning about the central plot point of
the issue: Meiko's experiences of sexual exploitation and sexual assault, and
the consequences she encounters when she fights back. This is a deeply
disturbing comic, because though the representations of the crimes committed
against Meiko are not graphic, they occur in situations where she is
effectively powerless -- one as a child, one as a prisoner -- and in both
cases her own violence, although enacted in self-defence, invites punishment
that underscores the misogyny of the near-future world in which <em>Bitch
Planet</em> exists.  That this issue begins with a trigger warning -- a
content advisory, as the comic labels it -- is demonstrative of the title's
larger project of de-centring the "traditional" comics reader, presumed by so
many people (most recently <a
href="http://comicsalliance.com/geoff-johns-dc-rebirth/">the troglodyte in
charge of DC Comics</a>) to be straight, white, cismen. As such, comics are
typically written with that assumption and to that audience. Women, then, are
drawn as sexual objects. Men are drawn as male power fantasies. White
characters are foregrounded; non-white characters are sidekicks and
canon-fodder. Heterosexual romances are standard set pieces, and cisgender
narratives are the almost exclusive focus. Typically, even when a comic sets
out to be inclusive of "non-traditional" comics readers, it bows to many of
these tropes and expectations, often out of an explicit desire not to exclude
straight, white men. Because we wouldn't want to do that! Heaven forbid!  And
then there's <em>Bitch Planet</em>, a comic that explicitly de-centres the
straight, white, cismale comics reader in favour of telling stories about
toxic masculinity and the destructive nature of patriarchy through the
experiences of women, and especially women not typically centred in comics:
fat women, women of colour, queer women and, soon, transwomen. Women's bodies
are depicted nude but not necessarily sexualized; their stories exist not
independent of men but in deep opposition to them; they are the protagonists
and the most significant actors in each storyline.  I'm thirty-three years
old, and I've been reading comics for as long as I can remember. Over the
course of my life, I can't even begin to imagine how many depictions of rape,
sexual assault, and sexual harassment I have read, almost exclusively in
comics using sexual violence against women as a trope that forwards the story
of a male character. This is the first time I have ever seen violence against
women framed in terms not of the perpetrator, but of the survivor. That's the
power of the trigger warning here -- it explicitly tells me that the comic in
interested in my well-being in a way that I had never before experienced.
Even further, this trigger warning -- with its assertion that you don't need
to read this issue to keep up with the story -- places the reader's wellbeing
over the importance of the narrative. Typical comics values like
completionism are utterly upended when we assert the primacy of the reader's
wellbeing over the integrity of a fixed narrative arc.  Obviously, cisgender
straight men can be raped, and obviously this trigger warning works to their
benefit also, centring their experience and foregrounding their wellbeing,
too. It is not explicitly gendered, and in remaining open to
all, destabilizes the narrative of rape. But consider that 1 in 6 women
experience sexual violence in their lifetime, compared to 1 in 33 men
(numbers from <a
href="https://rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence">RAINN</a>). This
is a concrete demonstration that the default reader is reimagined by
DeConnick and De Landro**: this comic is framed not for 32/33 men, but for
1/6 women. This interest in how the comic is received has a lot to do with
the popularity of it, and also of the popularity of <a
href="http://panels.net/2015/05/13/non-compliant-legion/">Non-Compliant
tattoos</a> among the comic's largely women-identifying audience base.  It's
worth thinking too about how including a content advisory here is an explicit
writing against the mainstream discourse around trigger warnings. Check out
how Google finishes the thought "trigger warnings are..."  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-
13-at-4.23.41-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4839"

13-at-4.23.41-PM.png" alt="Google says Trigger Warnings are &quot;bullshit,
bad, stupid, ridiculous.&quot;" width="759" height="162" /></a>  At one with
the oppressor as always, Google. If you dig into those results, the loudest
voices against trigger warnings tend to be the people who are least likely to
need them: established, middle-aged, white, male, tenured professors, and the
discussions are usually in relation to the classroom. We're told they prevent
students from being prepared for "real life," unlike those 15 page close
readings of <em>Moby Dick</em> that are completely relevant to everyone's
real life. I happen to think a student is more likely to do their best work
if they get a heads up about difficult content and can manage their emotional
world, but regardless of my views, it's clear that DeConnick and De
Landro <em>don't</em> think these warnings are "bullshit, bad, stupid,
ridiculous," but instead essential to setting up a safe and inclusive space
on the page to have some difficult and necessary conversations.  <em>Bitch
Planet</em> changes everything for comics readers who have never been the
primary audience for the work we love so much. By de-centring the
"traditional" comics reader, DeConnick and De Landro create an inclusive
space to discuss explicitly feminist issues. It's a breath of fresh air, and
it's why this first page of <em>Bitch Planet</em> #6 took my breath away. 
&nbsp;  * It's worth noting here that one of the great strengths in <em>Bitch
Planet</em> is the creators' willingness to interrogate their own choices.
DeConnick includes a letter critiquing the decision to kill off a character
of colour -- such a common and exhausting trope in comics -- and DeConnick
meditates on that choice and its larger significance. This willingness to
acknowledge dissenting and marginalized voices in the discussion of the work
is refreshing. As another example, DeConnick reached out to trans readers for
feedback on the forthcoming trans character -- notable given the frankly
terrible representation of trans people in otherwise celebrated comics
like <em>Y: The Last Man</em> and <em>Sandman</em>. Again, DeConnick and De
Landro force comics into a different kind of conversation than those with
which it has traditionally been concerned.  ** De Landro is not the artist on
this issue (that's guest penciller Taki Soma), but where the argument is
larger than the layout of this individual issue I credit him because he is a
co-creator of the series.  &nbsp;  Works Cited:  DeConnick, Kelly Sue

Warning</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t think
there&#8217;d be much of an argument against a statement that exploitation is
a major theme throughout the <em>Bitch Planet</em> series so far. The comic
is itself built around a nod to the exploitation genre&#8211;both as <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/2016/06/238-bitch-planet-and-the-de-centring-of
-the-traditional-comics-reader/">Brenna notes</a> and as the lives of women
are depicted throughout the storyline. Like Brenna, I also think that the
trigger warning in issue #6 is of real genuine importance, but for different
reasons (of course). </p>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-
13-at-2.48.17-PM.png"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-
13-at-2.48.17-PM.png" alt="The first page of Bitch Planet #6 offers a content
warning for readers." width="385" height="449" class="aligncenter size-full
wp-image-4837" /></a>  <p>One of the things we have to assume, as Brenna
rightly does, is that the audience for comics generally, is men.
There&#8217;s a few spaces for women but they are few and far between. It
feels to me like it should be obvious that comics are generally exploitive of
women&#8211;I&#8217;ve mentioned the whole Women in Refrigerators trope
before&#8211;but it seems to continue no matter. Women are often shut out as
consumers of comics content, let alone addressed as audience members.
Conferences where individuals conduct &#8220;serious discussions&#8221; of
comics are dominated by male speakers, male-centred subjects, etc., with
female subjects often content for discussions that focus to
&#8220;representations on the margins&#8221; rather than mainstream spaces.
</p>  <p>To begin in earnest, let&#8217;s look at an example of the
exploitation of women: <em>Cherry Pop Tart</em> by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Welz">Larry Welz</a>. Here&#8217;s
the cover for issue #7:</p>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dnw_cherry_pop_tart-
239.jpg"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dnw_cherry_pop_tart-
239-725x1024.jpg" alt="dnw_cherry_pop_tart-239" width="725" height="1024"
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4847" /></a>  <p>Like Tipper
Gore&#8217;s parental advisory changed to &#8220;Straight Outta
Compton,&#8221; the approval comics code stamp is reconfigured and becomes
&#8220;condemned by the comics clone conspiracy.&#8221; the &#8220;Adults
Only&#8221; warning serves to attract the young. In short, audiences
consume--and are brought to--the content because of, rather than in spite, of
the warning. </p>  <p>Taking its cue from the Tijuana Bibles of the period
10&#8211;15 years prior, <em>Cherry Pop Tart</em> features all sorts of
innuendo, cliche, nudity (almost always female), submission, and rape. The
submissive female characters frequently find themselves in exploitive sexual
situations, which they somehow welcome, and are generally pornographic
cliches. Now, here&#8217;s the first page of issue #3:</p>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/
dnw_cherry_warning_239.jpg"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/
dnw_cherry_warning_239-704x1024.jpg" alt="Cherry Pop Tart Warning"
width="704" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4848" /></a>
 <p>I don&#8217;t want to over-simplify this, but one of the things the
<em>Bitch Planet</em> trigger warning did for me was to reveal how entrenched
the narratives of &#8220;forbidden things&#8221; is in comics. If we think
back to the EC Comics issues that featured horror stories&#8211;women getting
decapitated and stuff like that&#8211;the headers for those comics always
dared us to read on. </p>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dnw_EC-warning_239.
jpg"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dnw_EC-warning_239.
jpg" alt="EC Warning" width="648" height="320" class="aligncenter size-full
wp-image-4849" /></a>  <p>There&#8217;s no doubt that the trigger warning
shifts, to some extent, the audience and the author&#8217;s responsibility to
that audience. That said, issue #6&#8217;s trigger warning is itself twisted
by the very exploitive nature of the genre. At the same time, <em>Bitch
Planet</em>&#8217;s reconfiguring and call-back to historical exploitive
genres is problematic given the role warnings played in those comics (and
films)--they encouraged rather than discouraged us to read on.</p>  <p>This
is not to suggest that <em>Bitch Planet</em>&#8217;s trigger warning is
ineffective. Rather, it is to reveal how impossible it is for female writers
to carve out a space in the genre that isn&#8217;t on the fringes. Certainly
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Sue_DeConnick">Kelly Sue
DeConnick</a>, herself once referred to as &#8220;Matt Fraction&#8217;s
wife,&#8221; is doing it with <em>Bitch Planet</em>&#8217;s storylines,
representations, and usurpation of exploitive genres, but the difficulty, as
always, is in the historical context. I could turn here to "A Room of Once's
Own," but then I think about <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne_Cixous">Helene
Cixous</a>' wisdom about an "always already" embedded patriarchal language
and I know I should shut the hell up because there is no room of one's
own.</p>  <p>Reading the trigger warning for issue #6 then filled me with
dread. While I appreciated and greatly respected the move, I was taken aback
by my own recognition that the genre has established such warnings as
invitations. These established tropes are a generic legacy that people who
wish to have &#8220;serious&#8221; conversations about comics do not address
often enough. Hiding in the conversations that look at how some rarified
comics represent marginal populations is the established narrative of comics
that is founded upon deeply entrenched male privilege as audience and
consumer. Be warned, it's time that was addressed as essential history in any
discussion of comics no matter how innovative or
representative.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span
style="font-weight: 400;">So far, I have read the first collected volume
(issues 1-5) of Kelly Sue DeConnick and Valentine De Landro’s </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Bitch Planet</span></i><span style="font-weight:
400;">. While I was reading it, I attended a talk by <a
href="http://www.gold.ac.uk/media-communications/staff/kember/"
target="_blank">Sarah Kember</a>, a digital media specialist from Goldsmiths
University of London, at the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a
href="https://poeticsofthealgorithm.wordpress.com/programme/"
target="_blank">Poetics of the Algorithm</a></span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> conference at the Université de Liège in Belgium.
</span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Kember’s subjects was glass
and its role in mediation and gender--its ability to provide illusions of
transparency and absence of mediation. Kember’s talk made me think about
mediation, transparency, and looking in </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Bitch Planet</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which
continually unsettles the reader’s perspective by incorporating multiple grid
patterns and drawing attention to the layers and means of our looking at the
comic. </span>  <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitch
Planet</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s reflexiveness goes beyond
its allusions to sexploitation and blaxploitation cinema to address the fact
that comics is a medium of “looking through” an apparatus and “looking at”
objectified depictions of subjects. DeConnick and De Landro upset any
illusions of transparency and absence of mediation in </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Bitch Planet</span></i><span style="font-weight:
400;"> by destabilizing our position as audience: we can never just look; we
are always aware that we are looking and that awareness uncomfortably links
us to the other lookers and watchers in the comic.  </span>  <span
style="font-weight: 400;">The framing of the grid in </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Bitch Planet</span></i><span style="font-weight:
400;"> is always changing. While grid patterns </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">
repeated, the general inconsistency from page to page emphasizes what the
comic wants us to see: a world under surveillance.  The women on Bitch Planet
are always being watched in a variety of ways. Cameras follow them everywhere
they go, and in the one place where the cameras don’t reach, the back of the
showers, a voyeur watches them through a ragged peephole in the tiles.
</span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">On Earth, women watch themselves on
order not to be discovered as being “non-compliant,” the crime that gets one
sent to Bitch Planet. In particular they watch their diets, so as not to
become fat, going so far as to weigh their excrement. As science fiction
dystopia that knowingly incorporates Foucauldian and Benthamite analyses of
observational power, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitch
Planet</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doesn’t have to stretch
present reality very far to achieve its effects.</span>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_0468.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4860"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_0468-768x1024.png
" alt="IMG_0468" width="768" height="1024" /></a>  <span style="font-weight:
400;">The breakdown of the pages is a constant reminder that we are complicit
in this surveillance, the frames of the comic being analogues to the frames
of the cameras and video monitors so prevalent in the text. The constant
shifting makes our viewing position highly self-conscious. We don’t get
settled into a particular pattern where we subconsciously block out or erase
the grid. Instead, our eyes become like cameras that have to refocus on every
page. </span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The pages that feature the the
control room monitors who appear to be running the cameras on Bitch Planet
exemplify our destabilization. The monitors wear rectangular monocles that
suggest augmented, enhanced vision, like Google Glass, perhaps. These men are
deceptive in that they appear to serve as a removed chorus to the events
depicted on the page, but the way they count down scenes, for instance,
suggests that they actually control what we see like cameramen switching
points of view at a sporting event. </span>  <span style="font-weight:
400;">The green colour that dominates the panels in which the monitors appear
sets them apart from the rest of the page, drawing our eyes to them.  While
we see these men individually, as if they are sitting in different rooms,
they are obviously talking to each other about what they see, which is what
we see on the page. But we look directly at their faces, so we see both them
and what they are looking at. We intervene between the monitors’ perspective
and the action on the page, splitting the two, as though the monitors have to
look </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">through us</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> to see what is happening.</span>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-26-18.37.13-
1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4867"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-26-18.37.13-1
-1024x768.png" alt="2016-06-26 18.37.13-1" width="1024" height="768" /></a> 
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, in spite of their seemingly
omniscient powers, these monitors do not see us. We become the glass through
which they view the actions of the women. The effect is unsettling, as we see
ourselves as both essential and invisible. Because these men look blindly
through us, and we look at them, seeing them seeing, a strange exchange takes
place. We are not exactly looking in a mirror, but we are looking at looking.
</span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the oft-noted qualities of
comics, as opposed to film, is the audience’s ability to control what we are
looking at in terms of pace and spatial relations. DeConnick and De Landro
turn this quality into a creepy complicity with the monitors of Bitch Planet.
</span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">A correlate to the all-seeing
monitors, Rick Weldon, the pervert who watches the women prisoners shower
through a ragged peephole in the tiles, also looks back at us. Rick occupies
the only place on Bitch Planet where the cameras can’t reach, but “Just
because there are no cameras doesn’t mean we aren’t being watched…. He
doesn’t report us. In exchange...he gets to watch.” </span>  <span
style="font-weight: 400;">To make the connection between this prurient
voyeurism and disciplinary surveillance DeConnick and De Landro switch
directly from the voyeuristic eye of Rick Weldon on one page to the camera
men on the very next. The camera men are one parenthesis and Rick is the
other in the oppressive gaze structure of </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Bitch Planet</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>  <span
style="font-weight: 400;">The hole through which Rick watches the women
shower is an escaped place of looking, an illegal place. Where the other
frames in the comic are neatly rectangular and organized, that hole is
ragged, just enough for an eye that is presented to us differently than the
more technologized, sanitized eyes behind the monocles. It is an immediate
eye, isolated from the rest of the face, never mind the body.</span>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_0470.png"><img
class="aligncenter wp-image-4859 size-large"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_0470-768x1024.png
" alt="IMG_0470" width="768" height="1024" /></a>  <span style="font-weight:
400;">When Kamau Kogo performs in front of Rick’s hole and then rips it out
and him with it, she reveals the body behind the eye. Furthermore when she
blackmails Rick into working for her, she inverts the power of the eye’s
gaze. She puts Rick into her service by being able to identify the freckles
on his penis. She turns the perverse male gaze and its fetishization of
detail back on itself. </span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Kamau’s act
is but one of the acts of resistance by women in </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Bitch Planet</span></i><span style="font-weight:
400;">. In issue 3 where Penny is dragged before the Fathers to confront her
non-compliance, all the male figures are behind screens, wearing similar
monocles to the monitors. There’s nothing particularly distinguishing about
these men: they are all more or less anonymous middle-aged men in jackets and
ties.  </span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Penny, meanwhile, is
something of a spectacle. She’s big and black. Half her head is shaved and
the other half sports dreadlocks. She is the antithesis of compliance and the
antithesis of the skinny white girls who share a single muffin amongst
themselves and talk about how much their poop weighs. </span>  <span
style="font-weight: 400;">As part of her incarceration and, one imagines, her
rehabilitation, Penny is hooked up to a technologically enhanced mirror that
is supposed to reflect an idealized version of herself--a kind of play on
Lacan’s mirror stage--but Penny sees herself as she is. The Fathers can’t
believe it. “That’s her ideal version of herself? There’s got to be a
mistake. Is the wire frayed?”</span>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot-2016-06-
28-19.30.421.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4872"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot-2016-06-28
-19.30.421.png" alt="Screenshot 2016-06-28 19.30.42" width="475" height="296"
/></a>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Penny’s ability to be her own ideal
attacks the power of the Fathers that depends on a discrepancy between how
women want to be and how they actually are. That a woman should be not only
accepting of her physical appearance but believe it to be ideal is not
conceivable in this world. </span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">In her
post, Brenna talked about the way that </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Bitch Planet</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s use of the
trigger warning decenters the “traditional” comics reader. I suggest that the
way the comic presents looking is part of the same project.  We are never
just looking at the scene transparently. Rather the comic disrupts our vision
and point of view continually. We pay as much attention to the apparatus as
to the thing the apparatus is supposedly allowing us to see. We literally do
not know what we are looking at. </span> <p style="text-align: center;"><span

Landro’s <em>Bitch Planet</em> is a departure for me, and I admit to not
having read it until it was suggested for Graphixia’s reading list – I should
have though, as Image consistently offers creator owned ventures complete
editorial freedom even to the point of soliciting them in back pages of their
various regular monthly series. The process is arguably easier than with any
other publisher and hey, if you’ve been thinking about creating your own
comic, try <a href="https://imagecomics.com/about/submissions">here</a> to
give it a shot. Because of this, many of the more outrageous, outlandish and
envelope-pushing titles (including those celebrated enough to be turned into
TV serials and films like <em>Walking Dead</em> and the upcoming
<em>Chew</em> and <em>Thief of Thieves</em>) have come from the publisher as
they tend to remove the restraints that are typically placed on mainstream
comics. Bitch Planet had early buzz, and its first issue ranked #50 in terms
of overall comic sales for the month of its release (selling 39,011 copies,
the third highest non-DC / non-Marvel comic overall). And the creators
certainly take advantage of the freedom allowed by Image in terms of defying
gender norms, criticizing patriarchy, attacking the justice system all while
providing copious titillation to the degree where readers are left
questioning the series’ motives.  <em>Bitch Planet</em> certainly draws on
the exploitation genre of the 50’s through 70’s, and it clearly does so with
full knowledge of the males who inevitably make up the vast majority of
comics’ readership –  given this, it’s a risky and intriguing move asking, on
the cover of the TPB, if the reader is “woman enough to survive
<em>B</em><em>itch Planet</em>.” As such, its pages are filled with copious
amounts of violence, nudity, shower scenes, even masturbation for the benefit
of the reader. Though the sheer number of naked female bodies feels almost
cloying at the beginning of the text, its insistence is clever in that while
it is clearly designed to arouse, it does so in such a way as to confound and
perhaps frustrate the reader’s expectations – the exposed bodies of even the
first pages aren’t even close to the stock sexy forms of mainstream comics,
instead being diverse in size, shape and race, a cross between Mazzucchelli
and Quitely’s takes on the human form. In displaying near constant nudity,
the art intensely and methodically de-sexualizes the characters which,
interestingly, removes their power over the men. For those outside the
prison, sexuality is tied to “non-compliance,” and those who do not adhere to
the norms of submission are contained and denuded of freedom regardless of
their nud<a

alt="shower" width="326" height="398" /></a>ity. <p style="text-align:
left;">Despite all this gratuitous nudity, the prisoners are not overtly
sexualized by the male characters in the text. Again, the fewer clothes the
women are given the less human they become. This is consistent save for by
the shower peeper in issue #4 who certainly pays for his voyeurism – the
shower is the one venue where sexuality is back in the control of the female
characters, away from the prying eyes of the cameras, and where it is
immediately exploited to secure release. As Kam gets herself off knowingly in
front of her voyeur, using her sexuality to control him, the similarly rapt
reader is now also subjected to the reversal of control over the scene, being
pinned by the protagonist’s machinations and sexual authority. How it’s
accomplished is compelling in terms of layout, as the ordered panels of one
page move to a scattered, frantic placement on the next as the scene becomes
more sexual. The voyeur's eye, like the reader's, doesn’t know where to look
to receive the best gratification. It’s in this heightened st<a

both for Tommy and for us, that the most powerful of messages can be driven
home. When Kam cuts the scene short to break through the shower stall to get
at the lecher, she’s metaphorically breaking through the fourth wall as well
in order to get at the reader more directly – she literally kicks at and
destroys the edges of the panel, looking in at us before pulling Rick Weldon
through. She scolds him, and us, as he’s now a “boy” instead of the man who
could pretend to have any kind of authority in the situation. But the
sexuality of the scene here is not suspended or as interrupted as it first
appears - it’s instead transferred into the violence of authority and
control.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/penny-rolle.jpg"><

src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/penny-rolle-300x259.
jpg" alt="penny-rolle" width="300" height="259" /></a>The message here is
clear as it is elsewhere in the text that exploitation can cut both ways, as
the men fall prey immediately to any woman who asserts control over her body
and her sexuality. Nudity is exploited at first then needs to be contained so
that the men are not weakened by its power. Even at the outset of the story,
when Penny is given her first prison uniform, she spits “where am I supposed
to put my other tit?” before being struck by the officers. The desire to
contain her physicality, and thereby her sexuality, seems to be a lost cause
from the very beginning – the men don’t know how to do it, though they claim
to have all the measurements, and the strong woman can find a way around her
captors’ devices if she’s willing to resist. Those who submit are put down,
as is clear by the death of the “innocent” wife who is imprisoned then
murdered as her husband has found a younger, more compliant replacement for
her. Her feeble protests ar<a

understand the underlying, inherent inequity of her situation, who is still
looking for some kind of egalitarian resolution <em>within</em> the confines
of patriarchy instead of outside it - something that is "deserved" or in some
way fair.</p> <em>Bitch Planet</em> is, above all, a call to arms for any
female readers it may have drawn at the outset and picked up along the way –
confidence, assertiveness and brashness are rewarded despite the initial
penalization. The violence and nudity is of course there to catch our
attention, but when the expectations are upended we stay for the subtext and
are openly politicized, as indicated by the questions for further study at
the end of the first trade paperback. It’s difficult to tell if the inclusion
of these feel at first a little pretentious, however Deconnick and De Landro
are on a mission, and they are angry, confident, unapologetic and ultimately
very thoughtful in using comics as a platform to access the often complicated
nuances of feminist theory.]]></content:encoded>

Before I get to the regular Graphixia theme I just want to say a few words
about Geneviève Castrée, who died last weekend from cancer aged only 35. I
didn’t know Castrée personally but I am a huge admirer of her work, and I am
sad that I won't see anymore of her poignant, detailed, spacious comics, or
the music she performed as Woelv and then later as <a
href="http://www.opaon.ca/" target="_blank">Ô Paon</a>. However, we should
celebrate the work she did create. My first thought for this post was to
write a longer tribute to Castrée but the piece I wrote for <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/2013/04/113/" target="_blank">Graphixia in
2013</a>, after the release of her book <em><a
href="https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/susceptible"
target="_blank">Susceptible</a></em>, says pretty much everything I would
want to about her work. Seek the book out if you haven't read it (or again if
you have), or any other of the comics and music she produced, such as the
strip <em><a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/12/arts/design/document-
genevieve-castree.html?_r=0" target="_blank">Blankets</a></em>. You will
touched by a tender yet formidable soul. The very last line of
<em>Susceptible</em>, as Castrée goes off into the world, is ‘I’m eighteen. I
have all my teeth. I can do what ever I want’. It is horribly sad to think
that by then she was already over half way through her life.  Castree's work
could not be more different to <em>Bitch Planet</em>. The pages in
<em>Susceptible,</em> for example, are often filled with open spaces,
although her art is meticulously drawn. <em>Bitch Planet</em> is filled with
so much detail that is often overpowering but this distinct lack of subtlety
seems like a deliberate action on the part of the creators. My first thoughts
on reading <em>Bitch Planet</em> were pretty much ‘OK, so it’s <em>Orange is
the New Black</em> in space’ – the first issue seemed to be setting up an
intersectional feminist story but very much seen through the eyes of a white
middle class character. Kudos to the writer Kelly Sue DeConnick for
subverting that expectation. Marian does not even make it to issue two, and
by the end of the first issue the two main characters Penny and Kamau, both
women of colour, are centre stage.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BP1.jpeg"><img
class="size-large wp-image-4897 aligncenter"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BP1-774x1024.jpeg"
alt="BP1" width="774" height="1024" /></a>  While my initial expectation that
the white character would dominate the narrative distanced me from <em>Bitch
Planet</em>, so too did the art. One of the main textural elements to the
artwork is the dots. At first the dots pushed me out of the reading
experience. There are so many dots. Dots that initially make the reader think
of old printed comics and movie posters but actually point to several
different media influences on the comic. As Peter noted ‘the frames of the
comic being analogues to the frames of the cameras and video monitors so
prevalent in the text.’  Most comics readers (especially of a certain age)
know what Benday dots are, even if they do not know what they are called. A
printed image is made up of four colours (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black –
commonly referred to as CMYK). Each colour was printed on by a separate
plate, and each plate positioned the dots at a slightly different angle. Once
all four colours were printed the eye reads the overlapping dots as a
(reasonably) full spectrum of colours. The process was invented in 1879 and
named after printer Benjamin Day Jr., but perhaps the most famous use of the
dots has been in the paintings of Roy Lichtenstein, where he reproduced
panels from comics. The dots are synonymous with comics up to the 1970s but
especially the 1950s and 1960s. However, as printing techniques have become
more sophisticated and able to handle more detail, the dots have become much
less obvious to the eye.  [caption id="attachment_4900" align="alignright"

alt="R. Sikoryak 'Vapor Girl' from Unstable Molecules" width="220"
height="300" /></a> R. Sikoryak 'Vapor Girl' from <em>Unstable Molecules</em>
(2003)[/caption]  Many comics artists working today have used Benday dots to
signify events outside the main narrative, sometimes as a flashback, or to
emphasise different media in the story. In the Fantastic Four story
<em>Unstable Molecules, </em>written by James Sturm, the main artist is Guy
Davis but there is a story-within-a-story where we see the pages of the
‘Vapor Girl’ comic that the young Johnny Sturm (the analogue of Johnny ‘The
Human Torch’ Storm in the narrative) is reading. This comic is drawn as a
wonderful pastiche of 1950s comics by <em>Masterpiece Comics</em> creator R.
Sikoryak. He uses the Benday dots to emphasise the time that the comics were
supposedly created, as well as to separate the comic from Davis’  more muted
indie comic style art in the main story.  In issue 3 of Bitch Planet the art
is not by co-creator and regular artist Valentine De Landro but by guest
artist Robert Wilson IV. However, it is more likely that series colourist
Cris Peter is responsible for all the dots. Peter uses this technique to
place the flashbacks to Penny’s earlier life into various eras. The earliest
segment, when Penny is helping her Grandma with the baking, is completely
coloured using the large dots to make the reader believe that it is happening
further back in time. The later flashbacks (later both in the issue and in
Penny’s life) use flatter colours more synonymous with comics from the 1980s
and later. My copy also has registration errors where the colours do not line
up correctly but I think this might be deliberate to give the impression of
that era’s printing technique.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BP2.jpeg"><img

src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BP2.jpeg" alt="BP2"
width="800" height="388" /></a>  If Benday dots are comics shorthand to
suggest a time in the past, this becomes confusing in <em>Bitch Planet</em>
because of the copious use of digital filters to recreate the Benday style
dots in the sections set in the story’s present. What at first seems like a
ham-fisted digital technique to ‘comicify’ the art, seems on further reading
to be a greater engagement with the technology of moving image rather than
the printed page. It is not just the green colour of the monitors that Peter
noted that alludes to the multiple monitoring screens in this world. The dots
in the art are also like the RGB dots of an old cathode ray tube TV or the
pixels of a computer monitor. The covers of each issue are like movie posters
for lost pulp movies of the 1970s and ‘80s. The era of ‘video nasties’ and
science fiction exploitation flicks viewed on a rented (or copied) VHS
brought to the comics page. The technique is not entirely successful as it
sets up a confusion with the Benday dots of old comics, and the digital
rendering is often too slick to really suggest the fuzzy and grimy era of
analogue television and video. It is difficult to recreate the VHS era in a
Blu-ray world.]]></content:encoded>

</em>Graphixia<em> is embarking on a series of posts about Kelly Sue
DeConnick and Valentine De Landro’s feminist dystopia </em>Bitch Planet<em>,
an excellent but also really important comics series from Image that offers a
feminist reimagining of the women’s prison exploitation genre. You should
read it. But you should also be aware that the post that follows, and likely
others in this series, contain spoilers in order to offer full analysis of
the series. If you haven’t read </em>Bitch Planet<em>, now is a really good
time — there’s only eight issues out so far! — and then you can follow
along with the series with us.</em>  <a

-11.44.41.png" alt="Mikki Kendall Essay Title" width="500" height="277"
/></a>  <em>Bitch Planet </em>is not necessarily a title that I would have
been drawn to on first glance. I’m less about the space dystopia and more
about the autobiographical musings when it comes to my comics reading for
pleasure. Yet, the prospect of a story that tackles questions of gender,
race, sexuality, the violence enacted upon women’s bodies and the
intersections of all these things, was too intriguing to pass up.  For my
post in this series I would like to talk about a particular aspect of the
comics, and more specifically an aspect of the comics in their monthly
published form. Each issue includes at its back not only the traditional
letters page, but also a collection of tweets, instagram posts, and
photographs from fans of the comics, many of whom are sharing their new
Non-Compliant tattoos with their fellow readers (this section is designed by
Laurenn McCubbin). As of Issue 5 Kelly Sue De Connick noted that this
section, entitled “Bitchfest”, was being expanded (not at the expense of the
story itself) to allow for more fan interaction with the issues in the shape
of 14 pages of backmatter. Significantly they also include an essay at the
end of each issue in a section entitled "Bitches be like...". Written by
feminist writers, academics and activists, the essays take the issues that
lie at the heart of <em>Bitch Planet</em> and make explicit and problematic
some of the questions about gender, race and intersectionality that run
through these narratives. However, due to printing costs and space the
collected editions of the comics do not include this content and I wanted to
take some time today to talk about the ways in which these additions to the
text have affected my reading of the comics. So far these eight essays have
included offerings from writers such as Debbie Chachra about the impact of
gender schemas (Issue 6), Tasha Fierce on cultural misconceptions of feminism
(Issue 2), John Jennings on the connotations of the black body (Issue 8),
Mikki Kendall on the racism of many white feminists (Issue 4), and Angelica
Jade Bastién on the Strong Black Female archetype (Issue 7). These essays
thoughtfully and succinctly interrogate the problematic assumptions that
underpin so much of what we read and discuss.  Bastién’s essay addresses the
way in which archetypes such as the Strong Black Female “poison the real
lives of black women. They inform everything from modern beauty politics to
the difficulty of advancement in the workplace” and discussed how new modes
of being for black women such as The Carefree Black Girl have emerged. She
concludes “even the best archetypes can still be limiting. At their best,
they should be treated as a guide not a rulebook. There have to be other
narratives to live, because black women contain multitudes”. This discussion
is necessary within these comics because it pushes the reader to question the
assumptions they might have made about these characters. In reviewing or
talking about <em>Bitch Planet</em> it is all too easy to applaud the
presence of “strong” and fierce women in prominent positions within a text.
(Indeed, an entirely unscientific scan of Google results when looking for
reviews saw the word “strong” appear in the vast majority of results.) But
what DeConnick and De Landro have done by including essays such as Bastién’s
within their backmatter is ask their readers to question what it means to
fulfill the archetype of the strong black woman and what the cost of these
fixed modes of being might be for women.  Amy Devine holds that these comics
are a feminist manifesto<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a> and I would
only go further than this to express that what DeConnick and De Landro have
done is not only make an explicit statement about their own feminism and that
of their book, but they have also created a safe space in which ideas can be
expressed, supported and indeed challenged in a positive manner. Dozens of
readers have written to them expressing the way in which this text has helped
them tussle with their own questions of identity and belonging and the
multitude of pictures of Non-Compliant tattoos are a tangible proof of the
resonance this book has for comics readers in 2015-2016. The creators aren’t
afraid to address critics within this space either, in the letters collected
in issue six they address the concerns of a reader that states he is
“uncomfortable with feminist jabs on the male collective”. Danielle Henderson
systematically and sympathetically takes apart his expressed concerns and
explores the reasons for the popular misconceptions about feminism that he
shares. I would not necessarily have had the patience to offer such a
response, but I think its inclusion was important as I imagine many other
readers of the comic shared his concerns. This is evidence of a wider
willingness amongst these creators to tackle the complex decisions made when
navigating the roles of writers of a Feminist Comic Book. As Brenna noted in
her post focusing on the Issue Six Trigger Warning:  &nbsp;  <em>“It’s worth
noting here that one of the great strengths in Bitch Planet is the creators’
willingness to interrogate their own choices. DeConnick includes a letter
critiquing the decision to kill off a character of colour — such a common and
exhausting trope in comics — and DeConnick meditates on that choice and its
larger significance. This willingness to acknowledge dissenting and
marginalized voices in the discussion of the work is refreshing. As another
example, DeConnick reached out to trans readers for feedback on the
forthcoming trans character — notable given the frankly terrible
representation of trans people in otherwise celebrated comics like Y: The
Last Man and Sandman. Again, DeConnick and De Landro force comics into a
different kind of conversation than those with which it has traditionally
been concerned”.</em>  &nbsp;  <em>Bitch Planet’s</em> backmatter feels like
a conversation with the reader, it is a safe and supportive space in which
fans can share their tattoos, express their love for the comic but also take
part in a reasoned and respectful discussion about what it means to be a
feminist in 2016 and how it feels to move through the world as a woman at
this time. More importantly, there is a specific focus on the experiences of
Women of Colour and <em>Bitch Planet’s</em> creators’ emphasis on this aspect
is particularly refreshing, all too often the feminism expressed in comics is
too similar to the self-congratulatory white feminism that abounds on
Twitter. DeConnick and De Landro offer a space in which they invite readers
to question them, their creative decisions and their content choices. They
choose to make explicit their political and feminist concerns by not only
creating a radically different type of comic story but also by offering a
platform for the writers of their essays. These essays are sometimes only
tangentially related to the major themes of that issue but they are always
significant to a wider reading of this comics' themes and concerns.  I wish
<em>Bitch Planet</em> wasn’t so significant because it is one of the only
spaces within mainstream comics that such topics are being addressed. I would
like to think that the comics market will soon be flooded with other titles
that are so overtly and explicitly feminist, I know this is unlikely.
However, in the meantime I am very happy that it is here, challenging me, my
fellow reader, and hopefully the wider comics industry to think harder about
the world, our politics and our feminism.  <a href="#_ednref1"

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span
style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of ‘alternative comics’ - and indeed, the
idea of the alternative in general - can have many meanings, and is likely to
have as many interpretations as there are comics readers out there. Charles
Hatfield wrote a book about the idea, in which he defined them as privileging
‘self-expression’ and ‘a poetic ethos of individual expression’ (2005,
17-18). I prefer to stretch this definition a little further for posts like
this to basically encompass anything that isn’t superheroes, or rather,
anything that can be framed as an alternative to an existing mainstream. The
distinctions aren’t that important here, but what is important is the idea of
the alternative as being the product of an act of resistance, something this
is in opposition to a paradigmatic mainstream.</span>  <span
style="font-weight: 400;">And boy, does </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Bitch Planet </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">oppose from the
word go. The cover of the trade paperback I picked up is dominated by the
silhouette of a woman with two middle fingers in the air, pointing outwards
at the reader, at the world, at the planet itself. The middle finger appears
frequently throughout the comics.</span>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BP01.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter wp-image-4922"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BP01.jpg" alt="BP01"
width="380" height="579" /></a>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Brenna
opened this series with an assertion that </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Bitch Planet</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is
fundamentally about de-centering the traditional cismale comics reader, and
this has been backed up in every subsequent post. I also agree, and
wholeheartedly back this up - this is the reason, I think, that we chose to
write about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitch
Planet</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the first place. But
it’s important to look at the ways in which this is achieved and why it’s
important to provide such an alternative, such a resistance, such a
de-centering.</span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dave’s post reminded us
of the tired ‘women in refrigerators’ trope and of how much violence and
exploitation of women there is in comics, and yet they still sell in their
millions, because a market has emerged. In the climate of neoliberal free
market dogma, in this fucked up political economy, anything that defies such
a market is in itself an act of resistance. </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Bitch Planet </span></i><span style="font-weight:
400;">addresses this head on, and defies pandering to such a readership and
such a market and to this as justification for the continuing existence of a
mainstream based on exploitation. </span>  <span style="font-weight:
400;">With its female protagonists and clear feminist themes and messages,
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitch Planet </span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">resists the mainstream explicitly. However, its
narrative does make clear the complex and often dialectical nature of such
resistances. The non-compliant women find themselves engaged in the
possibility of their own act of resistance by competing in the league of the
popular sport Megaton, only to find that the authorities change the rules of
the game on the hoof to ensure that the non-compliant women lose and remain
in bondage.</span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dave’s post also reminded
us that resistance can easily be co-opted by the mainstream, and that this is
in fact a familiar pattern that has been repeating itself since the
commercialisation of punk iconography (Hebdige 1979; McGuigan 2009). I doubt
that anyone reading Dave’s post will be unaware of the use of the ‘parental
advisory’ sticker as an invitation rather than a warning in the culture of
comics, as well as in the culture of rock and metal music (just in case you’d
forgotten, Limp Bizkit seemed cool once, and they were massively into the
ironic use of the parental advisory tag, among other non-specific acts of
douchebaggery). But as Dave pointed out, one important thing that the trigger
warning that opens issue 6 shows that a legacy has emerged in comics that
needs addressing, and needs addressing now. The legacy of warnings as an
enticing trope is dealt with by </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Bitch Planet’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s serious use
of the warning, reclaiming comics as a safe space, an act which is an act of
resistance itself when it is in opposition to a culture that does not respect
or promote self spaces because the traditional cismale comics reader is
unlikely to have any need for them.</span> <p style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BP-Spirit-Finger.jpg
"><img class="size-full wp-image-4923 aligncenter"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BP-Spirit-Finger.jpg"
alt="BP-Spirit-Finger" width="484" height="381" /></a></p> <span
style="font-weight: 400;">With these acts of resistance - and I could list
more - </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitch Planet</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> starts to look like the ultimate alternative
comic. It’s feminist, it’s complex, the art is engrossing, and it’s smart,
with the essays from feminist scholars in the single issue backmatter also
providing an act of resistance to the very comics format and once again
challenging, resisting and de-centering the traditional comics reader.</span>
 <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitch Planet</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">’s near-future setting is incredibly significant,
too, as this pushes the imagined dystopia closer to our present reality. The
exaggerations that make up some elements of the dystopia, such as the women
obsessively calorie-counting to the extent of weighing their excrement so as
to be compliant with the (we assume) governmental decree that women should
not be overweight, are not such great exaggerations as to be unbelievable.
The smartphones they use to measure their calories, and the apps that
facilitate this neoliberal quantifying of all things with economic logic,
already exist and are ready to be applied to state-sponsored authoritarian
compliance initiatives. </span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">And without
wishing to sound like a conspiracy theorist or perhaps a teenage libertarian,
such a level of authoritarian government is currently a very real prospect in
the Anglo-American sphere with Theresa May installed in 10 Downing Street
following the Brexit vote and with Donald Trump’s win of the Republican
presidential nomination on an authoritarian and outright racist, neo-fascist
ticket. Comics such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitch
Planet</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, defined and focused on
numerous, strong, explicit acts of resistance, are important on so many
levels - but on a basic one, they can guide us in our own resistance the
present political economy, even if politicians can’t. We need alternative
comics, and alternative comics as strong and awesome as </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Bitch Planet</span></i><span style="font-weight:
400;">, more than we ever have done.</span>  <span style="font-weight:

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">
is a surprisingly popular and enduring manga series by Tsugumi Ohba and
Takeshi Obata that ran in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shonen
Jump</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 2009 to 2012. In
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">, two 15-year old middle school boys, Akito Takagi,
the writer, and Moritaka Mashiro, the artist, aspire to become manga
creators.</span>  Mashiro makes a romantic bargain with Miho Azuki, a girl he
has a crush on: when she becomes a voice actress and stars in an anime
derived from one of his manga, the two of them will get married. They can
only get married when their dreams come true--a tough deal. But this telos
pulls the manga along, giving it a classic romantic conclusion to strive for.
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mashiro has added motivation because his
uncle died pursuing the manga dream; he is trying to compensate for, or even
avenge, his uncle’s death. When the pair’s </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Perfect Crime Party</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> hits number one in the reader rankings on its
debut, Mashiro takes evidence to his uncle’s grave.</span>  The uncle’s death
reminds us just how risky the manga dream is, requiring incredible work
demands, competition, and stress over the possibility of getting cancelled
and having one’s career fizzle, which is what happened to Mashiro’s uncle.
 When Mashiro falls ill at one point, is hospitalized, and has part of his
liver removed (!!!), we glimpse the serious consequences of living the manga
life.  <span style="font-weight: 400;">So while successful romance is one
horizon of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">, death is the other. We could end up with comedy
or tragedy. One of the neat things about </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Bakuman</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that as the boys
become more successful, the tension over </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">each</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> horizon ramps
up.</span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The physical and psychological
demands of manga increase with success, not lessen. And Muto Ashirogi (the
pair’s pen name) does not produce traditional manga, the kind that usually
get anime, or even that usually find success in </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Shonen Jump</span></i><span style="font-weight:
400;">, the magazine they publish for. So it’s possible that Takagi and
Mashiro can become successful, albeit non-mainstream, creators without being
able to complete the terms of Mashiro’s agreement with Miho.</span>  <i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">
gives insight into the Japanese manga industry, particularly about how one
goes about getting and maintaining a series in </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Shonen Jump</span></i><span style="font-weight:
400;">, a magazine of manga for boys. First comes the “one shot,” an initial
foray into a story world; if that is successful, serialization is
possible.</span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The creators work with
editors who help them get their manga ready for the monthly serialization
meeting, comprised of “captains” who represent groups of editors and the
deputy and chief editor. Although there are successful female creators at
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shonen Jump</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Bakuman</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the editorial staff
are entirely male. At the serialization meetings, the captains argue about
which manga series should be dropped from and added to the magazine.</span> 
Much depends on the reader surveys and the rankings that they produce. To
persist as a series, a new manga must start high in the rankings and maintain
a good position. It is common for a manga series to start strongly in the
surveys and then quickly plummet. It’s like the pop music charts, with the
creators essentially trying to maintain a top ten hit week after week, year
after year. A series that runs for a significant period of time is published
in “graphic novel” form, while the pinnacle of manga success is to have one’s
series adapted as an anime.  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The tension
between art and commerce is strong in </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Bakuman</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There is no denying
the commercial dimension of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shonen
Jump</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The market is competitive
and the magazine must snag readers and keep them hooked. And yet editors and
creators are in love with manga; they care about its quality and art.</span> 
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The competitive nature of manga production
tests the creators’ imagination and endurance as every creator or team
struggles against others to stay high in the reader rankings. In telling the
story of this competition, </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Bakuman</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an adaptation of
the primary genre in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shonen
Jump</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “battle manga.” Instead of
fighting the competition physically, Muto Ashirogi “battles” other creators
on the battlefield of manga.</span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Their
main rival is Eiji Nizuma, an exceptionally talented boy genius, whom the
heroes are continually trying to best. But while the series is full of
rivals, the various creators in </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Bakuman</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also support each
other. The only way they can all make it to the top is by continually raising
the stakes against each other, calling on each other to respond with a
superior effort. When Muto Ashirogi struggles, Nizuma has a difficult time
being inspired. He can only perform well when his rivals threaten to surpass
him. The manga world is a community of creators and editors who try to outdo
each other but not in a way that creates animosity.</span>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Nizuma.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4931"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Nizuma-300x249.png"
alt="Nizuma" width="300" height="249" /></a>  <span style="font-weight:
400;">In this panel, Nizuma responds to what he thinks is a bad decision on
the part of Muto Ashirogi. Nizuma knows that his rivals have a particular
talent and cannot stand to see them waste it. Nizuma knows all about manga;
he has an uncanny sense of what will be successful and what will not. And
although he vows never to be beaten by his rivals, he never stops thinking
about what is best for them. He is always honourable and ethical in his
struggle against Muto Ashirogi. </span>  While the respected rival or enemy
is a familiar trope in the representation of battles across cultures, having
a group of rivals who want each other to succeed and only battle each other
indirectly has the potential to diminish the dramatic effect of the
narrative. Battle without animosity is hardly exciting. The concept seems
worse than professional wrestling, whose fakery is overshadowed by the drama
it creates. At least wrestling has actual physical fights.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Rivals.png"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4932"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Rivals-279x300.png"
alt="Rivals" width="279" height="300" /></a>  <span style="font-weight:
400;">Indeed, if what makes battle manga popular is the action, the fight
scenes, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> is in short supply of it. However, the manga
compensates for this absence by replacing the depiction of action with the
depiction of intensity of feeling. Ohba and Obata present the faces and
bodies of the characters frozen in a state of passion at key moments of the
narrative. These are moments of determination, energy, decision, challenge
and epiphany. So, while drawing may not be the most dramatic action,
decisions and convictions about what and how to draw fit the bill.</span>  <a

style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman</span></i><span style="font-weight:
400;">’s creators understand that no comic can represent anything but
stillness, inaction. In battle manga as in superhero comics all action is
inferred, not undertaken. The idea of action is conveyed by an image of
static intensity whether one is fighting a villain or making a decision about
how to approach manga. </span>  As long as Ohba and Obata can convey this
intensity in the depiction of a face, they are able to present writing and
drawing manga as powerfully as the Fantastic Four knocking out Doctor Doom. 
These moments of drama appear with a kind of rhythm that sustains the energy
and tension of the manga as a whole. We feel the build up to the key moment
and the release that follows in a way that satisfies the aesthetic of the
action comic. We pause on these images because they hold us in an emotional
moment that conveys stored energy like an electrical charge, all the more
powerful for not moving.  <span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the
day, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> is not a “slice of life” or autobiographical comic
that depends on our identification with the slow rhythms of daily life.
Rather, it is a comic about work that pitches labour as heroic, drama-filled
activity. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> is an “action” comic about the combat between
rivals with pen and ink as weapons. The way that Ohba and Obata present this
rivalry through the intensity of expression allows <em>Bakuman</em> to feel
as vital as any conventional "battle" comic. </span>  <strong>Work

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I did something in
preparation for this Graphixia contribution that I almost never do: I bought
a physical book. When I enter into a comic book these days, it&#8217;s most
often done through my iPad. I&#8217;ve long been an advocate for
comics&#8217; creators to move more robustly into digital spaces, optimizing
the storytelling options available when devices such as the iPad are
leveraged to rethink narrative structures. All that said, the wall I hit when
I started &#8220;reading&#8221; Bakuman made me rethink a few things and
forced a self-reflexive reckoning about the assumptions I bring to the act of
reading. </p>  <p>First off, full disclosure: I do not read Manga. Ever. This
is the first time I have really settled in with a true Manga storyline in the
traditional sense. I&#8217;ve noted snippets of Manga before, the odd short
story or interesting layout, but I have never tried to read Manga in the way
I read North American comics. Some of what I&#8217;m on about here is
reflective of that first experience more than it is about deep critical
insight. All <em>that</em> said again, holy shit. Turns out, I can&#8217;t
read.</p>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/dnw_graphixia_246-
frontspiece.jpg"><img

frontspiece-1024x839.jpg" alt="dnw_graphixia_246-frontspiece" width="1024"
height="839" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4939" /></a>  <p>Not
knowing what hell I was doing, I bought the book (from my local comics shop)
and started to thumb through it. I wanted the experience of <em>Bakuman</em>
to be one of discovery&#8211;so I just picked a tattered, neglected,
near-remaindered, volume from off the shelf&#8211;number 9 if you&#8217;re
interested. Of course, I opened it the way I thought it should be opened and
was immediately confronted with a description of what&#8217;s &#8220;In the
NEXT VOLUME&#8221; where the preamble or dedication should be. Glancing left,
I noted the &#8220;This is the LAST PAGE&#8221; indicator with directions for
the uninitiated that is me: &#8220;<em>Bakuman.</em> has been printed in the
original Japanese format in order to preserve the orientation of the original
artwork. Please turn it around and begin reading from right to left. Unlike
English, Japanese is read right to left, so Japanese comics are read in
reverse order from the way English comics are typically read. Have fun with
it!&#8221; I immediately chastised myself for being such an ignorant buffoon,
and was grateful for the authors&#8217; good natured &#8220;Have fun with
it&#8221; for taking some of the pressure off and reducing the self-loathing.
But my antennae were up to my bias about reading, and the assumptions I was
bringing to this book. I was disoriented and distracted by my ignorance of
the instructions and my desperate need for them. </p>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/dnw_graphixia_246-
front-cover.jpg"><img

height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4938" /></a>  <p>I spent
a long time looking over the physicality of the book as a result of these
directions, something I couldn&#8217;t have done with a digital copy. I was
just feeling my way around the book. As it turns out, the cultural lesson in
the end-flap wasn&#8217;t enough when I reoriented the book and dove in. I
was all messed up. I started from the top right, thinking that was correctly
&#8220;backwards,&#8221; moved left, then down, then back right. Something
about how things were unfolding didn&#8217;t seem right. The story was
totally incomprehensible to me. The narrative not quite right. The pictures
seemed to <em>almost</em> present a narrative, but not quite. Characters were
sitting down and moving in the wrong direction. Was this Manga convention I
wondered? What was I missing? Is the Manga narrative always this fractured?
Must be something wrong with the translation, I thought. (Always blame the
translation when you don&#8217;t understand something, right? I&#8217;m such
a moron.) </p>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/dnw_graphixia_246-
page-example.jpg"><img

page-example-631x1024.jpg" alt="dnw_graphixia_246-page-example" width="631"
height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4942" /></a>  <p>I
returned back to the front and went in again. This time, I tried to sequence
the images more precisely. I began to assemble that narrative, a little
awkwardly, but a story was revealing itself to me in my head. I started to
feel stable, then I hit page six and everything seemed incorrect again. Wrong
story. I had put together some semi-comprehensible narrative that
wasn&#8217;t right. It certainly wouldn&#8217;t allow me to interpret the
text in any meaningful way, let alone follow the story. </p>  <p>Anyway, I
finally figured it out&#8211;start at the bottom right, move left, then up,
right to left, repeat. I was suddenly hyper conscious of my reading
though&#8211;I was struggling through the narrative, relying on the images
and deciphering the correctness of their sequence way more than I would with
a North American comic, struggling with the Manga conventions I knew nothing
about, I was even jarred by the placement of the titles. I felt a little
racist, pissed off at myself for not giving enough energy to the task of
reading, or getting into <em>Bakuman</em>; in short, I was even more
disoriented by my own ignorance and the power of my own assumptions about
reading comics. </p>  <p>Reading <em>Bakuman</em> in the physical form made
me aware of the conventions that govern my own reading in comics and how
those conventions are inherently cultural and devastating in their
&#8220;normalization&#8221; of the reading experience. The tangibility of the
book and the way it facilitated scanning, flipping, checking-back,
bookmarking, made more active, more prone to recognizing my own ignorance and
trying to get myself out of that ignorance. </p>  <p>Often, we refer to
comics that follow the Western left-to-right reading process as
&#8220;conventional comics,&#8221; but it&#8217;s clear they&#8217;re only
conventional if you&#8217;re part of the convention. We often applaud
disruptions in conventional narrative technique in comics&#8211;thinking Pia
Guerra, Jill Thompson, Annie Wu, and others&#8211;wherein the gutter is split
or transgressed, the page broken differently, spreads over two full pages.
However, reading these disruptions when there is little sense of the
conventions they are breaking renders the artiface moot and distances the
reader, makes the purpose hard to decipher, and the exposes conventions
rather than disrupting them. It&#8217;s really hard to see all this in
digital versions that tend to disrupt the actions of flipping, scanning,
etc., I mention above.</p>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/dnw_graphixia_246-
page-example-01.jpg"><img
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/dnw_graphixia_246-
page-example-01-1024x865.jpg" alt="dnw_graphixia_246-page-example-01"
width="1024" height="865" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4941" /></a>
 <p>Furthermore, looking at the depictions in <em>Bakuman</em> was also a
disorienting experience. So much yelling, wide-open mouths, similar faces,
emojis in the balloons, everything is backwards, the story is so layered with
previous storylines, characters, situations. All these Manga
conventions&#8211;I won&#8217;t use that word again,
promise&#8211;destabilized my ability to follow the story without really
working to piece things together. I was a mess, a reading disaster. Getting
through six pages took me as long as it takes me to get through an entire
Western comic. And I had no idea what the hell was happening in the story.
</p>  <p>Returning to my opening about the iPad brings me to the main point
here&#8211;we&#8217;re all victims of normalizing everything for our own
cultural situation. The iPad, more than the book, can augment and direct our
reading by allowing layers on top of the text / image, breadcrumbs that help
us make sense of what we might find confusing. The device&#8217;s ability to
represent the comic frame-by-frame mitigates the disorientation of reading
&#8220;backwards.&#8221; Immersing myself in the tangible <em>Bakuman</em>
brought home&#8211;to the privileged reader that I am&#8211;some of the
struggles involved in learning second languages, where the syntax, layout,
and logical progression are not based on Latinized, Germanic, forms. Images
are no help, sequencing is frightening, and just chuck the whole cultural
understanding or cultural context right out the window&#8211;it&#8217;s
hopeless. </p>  <p>We&#8217;re fond of reflecting upon how comics can help
individuals learn to read. I wonder what else&#8211;ideologically
speaking&#8211;comics might be capable of teaching. It might be fun to teach
Manga in an English Literature class to illustrate the power of convention
(sorry) in narrative, inter-textual connections, and in reinforcing cultural
assumptions. That is, comics&#8211;and I&#8217;m calling Manga comics,
don&#8217;t care what you think&#8211;teach us <strong>how</strong> we read,
what we&#8217;re <em>looking</em> for when we read, and all the other
assumptions, short-cuts, and comfort we derive from ingrained expectations
about what we&#8217;re doing when we read.</p>  <p>I&#8217;ll admit, I never
got past page six of <em>Bakuman</em> #9, but I will. Eventually. And
I&#8217;ve learned more about <strong>how</strong> I read from six pages of
<em>Bakuman</em> than I have learned from a comic in a long time.

<title>#247 Cultural Cross-Pollination: Haida Manga and the Idea of
Empire</title>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[We're thinking through
manga this month at Graphixia and, true to form, I am taking the topic in a
different direction to think about one major adaptation of the manga form to
gain prominence here in Canada: Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas' creative hybrid
he calls Haida Manga. Put simply, Yahgulanaas fuses some of the formal
elements of manga with some of the iconography of Haida culture. (The Haida
are a Pacific Northwest Coast Indigenous people of North America, whose
ancestral territory is the archipelago of Haida Gwaii off the coast of
modern-day British Columbia.) The main Haida Manga text to date is
Yahgulanaas' <i>Red: A Haida Manga</i>, which exists in a sort of liminal
space between fine art and comic book as it lives in both spaces concurrently
-- <em>Red</em> is both a mural exhibited at galleries like the Seattle Art
Museum and a traditionally-published book that Yahgulanaas encourages readers
to dismantle in order to create the mural for themselves.  The visual play
here is to merge traditional Haida formlines and shapes with the fluidity of
borders and gutters offered by the manga form in order to create a comic
where the border is explicitly part of the narrative -- indeed, by the end of
the comic, it stands in for Red's own lifeline.  The whole project is really
pretty cool. This video gives a thoughtful introduction to the hybridity of
the piece:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POMbyPLhqRI  But what I'm
thinking about at the moment is the why behind the cultural cross-pollination
in <em>Red: A Haida Manga</em>. The narrative of the story is, at least in
part, a narrative about colonization -- Red is corrupted and distracted from
the old ways because of his obsession with revenge, and he becomes violent
and disconnected from his people as a result.  For Yahgulanaas, Japan exists
as a space outside of the colonial relationship between settler Canadians and
Indigenous peoples. In <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mzpdk/
i_am_internationally_known_manga_visual_artist/?st=is8g1q6k&amp;sh=0d48bd46">
his Reddit AMA</a>, which I strongly recommend you check out, Yahgulanaas
talks about the opportunities Japan provided for the Haida sealers who traded
there to feel far more like included members of society. This was a time when
explicit and overt racism kept strict lines drawn between Indigenous and
non-Indigenous Canadians, but no such delineation was made for these men in
Japan: <blockquote>At the same time as these horrible things are part of the
formal state policy [in Canada], Haida men found themselves in Japan. They
worked there as seal hunters working on sailing ships that sailed the North
Pacific following the Pelagic Fur Seal. Stories would come back at home about
how wonderful the experience was of being in Japan for these Haida men. They
could walk freely on the street. They could go into any restaurant. They
could walk into an shop and spend money. They could use toilets. They were
treated like full human people. Such a relief, and such a pleasure, when
compared with the constant pressure back in North America.</blockquote> Part
of the merger of Japanese and North American styles in this hybridity, then,
seems to be a way to escape the particular language of English
settler-colonial art forms in order to talk about colonization more
fruitfully -- the old idea of not being able to dismantle the master's house
with the master's tools. By stepping around a North American language and
adopting a Japanese-Indigenous hybridity, Yahgulanaas is freer. The borders
and gutters are not only essential to the narrative, but essential to
asserting a formal difference for this story. I think this makes a lot of
sense, and is not an uncommon use of hybridity in anti-colonial
or decolonizing literatures.  But. Here's where this becomes a
post-in-progress, one with more questions than answers: what do we do with
the troubled position of Japan as somehow anti-colonial in this context?
Japan, of course, was an Empire itself -- one with its own horrific record of
"horrible things [that] are part of the formal state policy." The
cross-pollination is a useful way to extract this comic from a North American
colonial discourse, but it doesn't remove colonization and the traumas it
visits upon Indigenous populations entirely. Readers with an awareness of
history are left to puzzle out the meaning of hewing this expression of Haida
culture and history to another colonizer. Does the narrative, then, only
shift on the surface?  As I say, I haven't thought through the answer to this
yet. Haida Manga offers some unique opportunities for telling Indigenous
North American stories outside the settler-colonial literary tropes imposed
upon the Haida. But it doesn't divorce the narrative from colonial trauma
entirely, and maybe that's Yahgulanaas' whole point: that these things are
not, ultimately, separable; that the project of decolonization is not to be
tackled state-by-state but instead globally. The answer to this is not yet
clear to me.  The book, however, is gorgeous. Do yourself a favour and read
it.]]></content:encoded> <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[]]></excerpt:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Ohba and Obata’s
<em>Bakuman</em> was unfamiliar to me before it was offered as the topic for
this round of Graphixia posts – I’d read the first few volumes of <em>Death
Note</em>, so I was quite excited to see something else from the pair. My
manga experiences lately have just been the regular peer pressure I
experience being led towards the anime serials on crunchyroll, so to have
something in print again with that disruptive left to right <a

alt="bakuman1" width="195" height="300" /></a>reading experience that <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/2016/08/246-reading-bakuman-reorienting-
disorientation/">Dave encountered</a> a couple of weeks back was exciting,
and I was lucky enough that my local Indigo had the first few volumes. Once
you’re used to it, the brain adjusts to the left to right quite handily, and
I normally find that I have to shake it off when going back to reading my
regular Western monthly comics afterwards.  <em>Bakuman</em>, however, is not
my typical manga that is full of horror or post-apocalyptic prophecy – it’s
instead a self-reflexive platform through which its already successful
writers can espouse their beliefs in the challenging nature of the industry,
the sacrifice that’s needed in one’s personal life, the commitment and
particularly, and sometimes problematically, the ego involved in thinking
that it’s only “geniuses” (110) who can pull off the feat. To be successful
means to potentially give up one’s life in service of the goal, and for
Bakuman’s two protagonists we see this drive to gamble with all they have to
pursue their dreams of creating popular manga.  There’s a deep irony in
<em>Bakuman</em> though in that Ohba and Obata, by the time of its
publication, were already successful manga creators and would very likely
have known in advance that <em>Bakuman</em> would have sold well and would
have been received well critically – there’s no gamble here, as they make out
all manga creation as being. They try to dispel the idea in hopeful
protagonist Moritaka’s statment that his manga-writing uncle failed miserably
after his second and third series didn’t sell well, though Shonen Jump
certainly had a place for <em>Bakuman</em> before pen was ever set to paper.
And it’s easy to see how the creative team takes advantage of this fact to
push something of an agenda. Not only do they want the(ir) heroic story of
the manga creator told, but they would have known that this was one series,
because of their <a

alt="How to" width="243" height="394" /></a>reputation due in large part to
the earlier success of Death Note, which would have certainly found its way
to a North American audience. Even in the first issues, you can see how they
work towards initiating this potential audience, likely unfamiliar with the
genre and reading technique, to manga in ways that are often blatant but at
other times quite subtle.  In manga that does find its way to Western shores,
there are normally the telltale markings on the physical process of how to
read it for unfamiliar audiences. Dave discovered one of these by opening the
book backwards, whereby you receive instructions (included here again for
good measure) as to the reading order of the panels, but instructions are
also sometimes littered throughout the book itself with smaller guiding
icons. <em>Bakuman</em> bears many of these, the small arrows on the upper
left hand corner of a page, where a Western reader would unwittingly and
“naturally” start reading, which state “read this way” to remind the <a

img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4953"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/readthisway.jpg"
alt="readthisway" width="156" height="116" /></a>reader where to direct the
eyes. Their presence is unsurprising, but what’s interesting is the frequency
in the first issue of <em>Bakuman</em> and, most importantly, the room that
the artist left for them to be placed. Normally they’re inserted only where
the art allows, which makes the markings rather infrequent, but in the first
12 pages Obata leaves enough space for three of the images to be placed while
the rest of the issue, as is characteristic of most manga, fills the page top
to bottom with art. Obha and Obata, likely knowing that their work would be
anthologized and distributed in North America by Viz Media (like most manga
in shops here), as industry insiders did them a favor and left the
appropriate space for the translated editions.  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/language.jpg"><img
class="alignleft size-large wp-image-4955"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/language-839x1024.jpg
" alt="language" width="839" height="1024" /></a>Perhaps it’s not so
surprising that in a manga about manga we would see this kind of nod to cross
cultural promotion, but it does certainly speak to the importance that the
creators acknowledged the series as having in their canon. There are stronger
messages here too that push cross cultural awareness of readership,
particularly in the first chapters when overtly stating that “manga is the
pride of our Japanese culture” – given that the series had been optioned for
translation immediately upon its release, it’s very clear that they see
themselves as cultural messengers here. This becomes even more evident when
we see Takagi and Moritaka discussing Japanese naming conventions at the
outset of chapter two: they break down the multiple meanings of their own
names in Kanji characters through banter that feels out of place and which is
there purely for a Western readership. Obata even includes drawings in the
word balloons to drive the point home, and to a native reader of manga it
would likely come off as cloying. There are multiple points in the story
where it feels that culture is self-reflexively being pushed, explained,
introduced to an outside and captive audience. In literature these indicators
are often fun to tease out when reading translations of texts, but in
<em>Bakuman</em> it becomes clearer and clearer that the story was written
with these in mind. Even the inclusion of the original storyboards to bookend
each chapter seem openly designed to draw the reader into process and
subtext. But <em>Bakuman</em> is very careful to push as hard as it can
against the fourth wall without actually breaking it for the purpose of
maintaining the narrative.  <em><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/readers-
e1472536088958.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4954"

e1472536088958.jpg" alt="readers" width="250" height="627" /></a>Bakuman</em>
brings into relief what happens when authors know that they are going to be
successful and have an audience before they even begin to write – they
include inside jokes, they are openly sexist (and sometimes misogynist), they
add agendas that have only specious bearing on the plot. They discuss the
minutiae of their own profession, down to explaining which is the best pen to
use when drawing manga. They even go so far as to poke fun at their own
readership, breaking down what they see as being juvenile about it in the
swordplays of boys and the romances of the girls, then dismissing the whole
endeavor to aim for something novel as Takagi states “nobody really analyzes
manga as they’re reading it” (110). Given the tedium of some of the details
and the ego of the characters, it’s a little surprising that Bakuman is as
exciting and engaging as it is. I don’t mean to imply that <em>Bakuman</em>
is a weak story at all, as it’s quite compelling in terms of pathos for
anyone who may have wanted to be a manga creator (likely the vast majority of
its readership) and the trials that away those who make a run at it. It’s
also been turned into a live action series and an anime which were both quite
successful in their own right, again gesturing to the fact that Obata and
Ohba may indeed be correct in acknowledging manga’s supreme contribution in
exporting modern day Japanese culture to a global audience. That said, it’s
also dripping with the bravado that such a claim necessitates when it’s given
by the manga creators themselves, as in <em>Bakuman</em> they, both
characters and authors, are solely and squarely bearing the burden of
cultural exportation. Perhaps this is why it feels so pushy at times, so
didactic that it needs to be put down to process the self-congratulating
nature of its content. Credit, however, where it’s due – the success of
<em>Bakuman</em> and the very fact that we’re reviewing it here is a strong
indicator that Ohba and Obata knew exactly what they were doing in crafting
their story about craft for the best cross cultural reception possible ten
thousand kilometers away.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span
style="font-weight: 400;">I hadn’t heard of </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">
until Peter suggested it for this series, but I immediately came on board
when he pitched it to me as a manga heavy with portrayals of work (which is,
y’know, kind of my thing). My focus thus far in my academic work on comics
and in my consumption of comics has been on Anglo-American texts, so my
knowledge of manga is limited, but I have read some notable works - often
tracing backwards to find the origins of anime such as Miyazaki’s stunning
</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSba9hwCaU"><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Nausicaä of the Valley of the
Wind</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So reading
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> for this post has been both a challenge and a
great pleasure.</span>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Geniuses.png"><img
class="size-full wp-image-4967 aligncenter"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Geniuses.png"
alt="geniuses" width="505" height="502" /></a>  <span style="font-weight:
400;">I’ll confess that I haven’t yet read all 176 chapters of
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">, but I’ve gotten most of the way there, not
repeating Dave’s </span><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/2016/08/246-reading-bakuman-reorienting-
disorientation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">struggle</span></a><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> with reading right to left as I got through all of
the thematically similar </span><a
href="https://www.comixology.co.uk/Yonen-Buzz/comics-series/40239"><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Yonen Buzz</span></i></a><span style="font-weight:
400;"> and some other </span><a
href="https://www.comixology.co.uk/TOKYOPOP/comics-publisher/14-0?ref=

400;">Tokyopop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> titles that way
some years ago. I’m am aching to read the conclusion of the romantic plot,
even if elements of it are a little trite (the mother of the girl he’s in
love with is the girl who his uncle was in love with back when he was a
struggling manga artist? really)? The romantic plot, and in fact the plot
elements of Bakuman as a whole, aren’t really that important, though. They’re
just pegs on which to hang the significant, important and prominent themes of
work, struggle, art and commerce, and anchors for fascinating and nuanced
portrayals of comics work. </span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">These
portrayals are delivered in a very meta, self-conscious framework that, to my
knowledge, has no close equivalent in Anglo-American comics, either
mainstream or alternative (alternative being defined, if you like, by
</span><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/2016/07/244-bitch-planet-the-ultimate-act-of-
resistance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acts of
resistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). The plot of
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman </span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">concerns a writer-artist duo trying to get their
work serialised in the very same weekly magazine in which </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">
is published, and the conversations between them often reference existing
manga, including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Death
Note</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the previous work by the
creators of <em>Bakuman</em>. One such reference even refers to the writer of
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Death Note </span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">being quoted as saying he’d starve if he didn’t
keep working, impressing the importance and ongoing, never ending, eternal
nature of comics work upon the two young rookies, or gamblers, as they style
themselves.</span>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Gamblers.png"><img
class="size-full wp-image-4968 aligncenter"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Gamblers.png"
alt="gamblers" width="479" height="267" /></a>  <span style="font-weight:
400;">The above panel introduces the recurring notion of the gambler, which
in turn reinforces the myth of the (usually lone) genius that persists in
both manga and Anglo-American comics and, in fact, in pretty much all forms
of art. I’ve shown in my work on Jeff Smith’s </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Bone</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how
this myth of the ‘singular creative vision’ can be upheld, and how it denies
the importance of collective production. Most works of art, as Howard Becker
highlighted in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art
Worlds</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, are made by many hands,
but still the myth of the singular genius persists in comics work, though -
and apologies for the somewhat shameless plug - mine and Casey Brienza’s
forthcoming book </span><a
href="http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137554772"><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Cultures of Comics Work</span></i></a><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> provides a major argument against this enduring
myth.</span>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Editors.png"><img
class="size-full wp-image-4969 aligncenter"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Editors.png"
alt="editors" width="497" height="501" /></a>  <span style="font-weight:
400;">In the world of </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Bakuman</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the genius can
sustain himself and need not gamble; the rest of the mere mortals who want to
become manga artists must not just gamble, but gamble with each other, in
collectives at once supportive and adversarial (as shown in the above panel,
in which a competing manga artist shares information about an editor). As
Peter’s </span><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/2016/08/245-battle-manga-bakumans-depictions-of
-intensity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opening post</span></a><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> in this series highlighted, this relationship with
competitors might feel somewhat strange to Anglo-American readers, who are
perhaps more used to the hardened neoliberal free market dogma of aggressive
competition </span><a
href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/literature/american-
literature/affect-and-american-literature-age-neoliberalism"><span
style="font-weight: 400;">made explicit in western literature</span></a><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> and culture. Workers coming together in the face
of a drive to competition is - you guessed it - a major act of resistance,
especially in the context of comics work (or manga work).</span>  <span
style="font-weight: 400;">This is the most important thing that I, as someone
interested in comics work, have taken thus far from </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">:
that working together towards large goals and shared dreams is possible, and
something to be aspired to. I can’t think of a similar comic in the
Anglo-American sphere that pushes this message as hard as </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">
does, but it’s a message I think is upheld by the small presses and
communities in alternative comics, where collective support is needed in the
face of individualist neoliberal stagnation. </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman</span></i><span style="font-weight:
400;">’s dynamic duo took a gamble on collective work and it paid off. Let’s
hope that more comics artists around the world can do the
same.</span>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;  <span
style="font-weight: 400;">I came to </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Bakuman </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">belatedly, expecting
documentary evidence. </span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside of the
overwhelming shonen success stories, I remain unaware of most popular manga,
and it is therefore not surprising that I should have missed the series
during its initial window of publication. Although I am paying increasing
attention to trending titles and try to at least have a look at the first
issues of new series, I still rely on recommendations from a limited number
of gatekeepers (</span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Actuabd.fr</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Télérama </span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">in France, Joe McCulloch and the </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Comics Journal</span></i><span style="font-weight:
400;"> in general, and most of all the librarians at the the various city and
university libraries I visit), which means that qualified advice is always
precious to me.</span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, when reading
Northrop Davis’s recent </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manga and
Anime go to Hollywood</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I was not
only following his depiction of the cross-pollination between the two
industries, but also taking notes about the various publishing landmarks
which had escaped me thus far. I ended up reading </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Battle Angel Alita</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> (also known as </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Gunnm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), since its
forthcoming adaptation is discussed at length, but also </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,
which Davis enthusiastically describes as “a terrific insider’s view of the
industry” (363). Strikingly, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manga
and Anime go to Hollywood </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">includes
a considerable number of pages and covers from the series, which serve both
as examples of manga production but also as quasi-documentary depictions.
When describing the way mangakas are paid, Davis goes so far as to delegating
the explanations to a deputy editor in </span><i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Bakuman</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, reproducing an
especially verbose two-page sequence with the following caption: “Mangaka are
paid in a few ways which reflect their power versus American creators. This
page [sic!] explains some of those” (180).</span>  &nbsp;  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/editorial-office.jpg
"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4976 size-full"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/editorial-office.jpg"
alt="editorial-office" width="732" height="616" /></a> <p style="text-align:
center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The documentary impulse on display
(vol.2 33)</span></p> &nbsp;  <i><span style="font-weight:
400;">Bakuman</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s pedagogical intent
could not be clearer. Indeed, the first few collected volumes contain a form
of documentary overload. The action will often stop altogether for a few
panels or even a few pages of factual, well-documented exposition. In those
moments, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman </span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">turns into a well-drawn, engaging, but narratively
dysfunctional educational comic. I loved it: not only was I learning a lot,
but I was also going through an awkward and to me unprecedented composite of
genre tropes (succeeding against all odds, getting the girl, bettering
oneself, etc.), unabashed sexism with more than a hint of eroticism (v.1
50)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and documentary impulses.</span> 
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After some necessary warning regarding the
gender politics in the series, I lent the book to my 10 year old daughter,
who reads manga and had previously enjoyed a light academic book on Akira
Toriyama’s career. As expected, the educational side of Bakuman appealed to
her a great deal. She paid attention to the pieces of technical advice and
tried some of them out. She also memorized the rather byzantine editorial
process which features in the book, as well the numerous technical terms
associated with it. Soon, we were yelling together “Avec ça on sera premier
au Hon-Chan!” (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will get us to
the </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sera premier au Hon-Chan!”
(​</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will get us to the 1st place
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the hon-chan</span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">), whenever we had something to celebrate: the
statement is a recurring feature in the book, as Takagi and Mashiro encourage
each other with the “</span><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/2016/08/245-battle-manga-bakumans-depictions-of
-intensity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intensity of
feelin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">g” so characteristic of the
series.</span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The “hon-chan”, if you have
to ask, is the weekly reader survey used by the </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Shonen Jump</span></i><span style="font-weight:
400;"> to rank its series and determine which may be cancelled. It is
available roughly a week after the publication on an issue, a few days after
the “sokuhō”, a survey based on a smaller sample of respondents.</span> 
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both words appear as such in the French
edition by Dargaud, under its Kana imprint. In the English translation,
however, the “hon chan” is simply called the “final report”, while the
“sokuhō” is translated as “the early results” (vol.2 178, in both cases). The
French edition, translated by Thibaud Desbief, clearly privileges
“authenticity” over immediate intelligibility. Tiny footnotes explain crucial
terms when they first occur, but these words remain untranslated and
unexplained in subsequent volumes. This is not limited to technical terms
pertaining to the publication of manga, as the series also includes words
such as “bakuchiuchis” [gambler]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in
ch.1 or “neet” [inactive], ch.2, among many expressions kept intact in the
translation.</span>  <a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hon-chan.jpg"><img
class="aligncenter wp-image-4977 size-full"
src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hon-chan.jpg"
alt="hon-chan" width="742" height="1184" /></a> <p style="text-align:
center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“hon-chan” vs. “final report” (vol.2
178)</span></p> &nbsp;  <span style="font-weight: 400;">This corresponds to a
larger trend in manga translation identified by Heike Elisabeth Jüngst in her
2008 survey of the practice, where the emphasis is put on the “Japaneseness”
of the text (56). The translation of onomatopoeia in the French edition of
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman </span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">is consistent with this pattern: the Japanese
katakanas are retained, and the translator added sounds in western alphabets
- some of which are typically French (“clac”, “gloup”), while others sound
English (“tap, tap, tap”) - in a similar type. </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">The result is pleasing, efficient, and
aesthetically close to the original, and although this choice was part of the
publisher’s guidelines rather than the translator (Debief), it is coherent
with the options chosen in the translation of dialogues.</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> Similarly, most textual inscriptions in the
pictures are kept intact, with footnotes providing the translation. The only
exception is to be found whenever the text </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">is </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the
picture (letters, e-mails, magazine articles), in which case the French
translation replaces the original lettering, for obvious practical reasons
(vol.1 165, for instance).</span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">However,
while the French version of Bakuman remains perfectly legible provided no
volume is skipped, the choice not to translate so many technical words
creates a fascinating tension within the series. By focusing on a “feigned
authenticity” (Jüngst “Translating manga” 73), the translation runs counter
to the educational drive of the work. It insists on using unfamiliar words to
describe objects and concepts that are perfectly understandable to western
readers and as such frames them as specifically Japanese. At times, the manga
seems to educate about an alternate reality: it documents </span><i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">otherness</span></i><span style="font-weight:
400;">.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Thibaut Debief about
his choices regarding the translation, and he confirmed that the didactic
nature of Bakuman informed his strategy. Since the manga was likely to be
read by aspiring French mangakas, he felt it was important to provide them
with the appropriate words (Debief). This would seem to reverse the
translation process: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bakuman
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is imported in France, but retains
the opposite movement, the possible move from France to Japan.</span>  <span
style="font-weight: 400;">In another essay, on the translation of educational
comics, Jüngst notes that educational manga constitute a separate category
within the genre:</span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for
choosing an educational comic for translation may lie in culture-specific
elements that are exotic and attractive for the target group in the target
culture. This is the case with educational manga, which have been translated
following the general boom in manga. (Jüngst “Translating educational comics”
174)</span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">In her example, a manga
providing advice to young girls at school was translated for a German
audience for whom these problems would have no equivalents (193). However, in
Bakuman, the cultural side of the story and the technical one are presumably
both of interest to the readers. Emphasizing the former runs the risk of
confusing the latter.</span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Two salient
examples come to mind. The first is the use of the word “nemus” to describe
preliminary sketches for stories. In the French version of other educational
or documentary mangas, these are translated as “esquisses” [sketches]
(Toriyama) or as “storyboards” (Richii), with no obvious loss of meanings.
Both phrases are commonly used, and other alternatives come to mind easily,
such as “découpage” or “croquis préparatoires”. The word “nemus” is thus
purely a marker of otherness.</span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The
dialogue in which the hon-chan and the sokuhō are introduced is possibly even
more striking. Since the words in this context are unusual, even for a
Japanese reader, they are explained at length within the diegesis, in a
transparently didactic passage (see illustration above). The explanation is
sufficient for a French reader as well, since the concept is not hard to
understand in the first place. However, Thibaud Defief included a footnote
explaining how he </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">could
have</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> translated but chose not
to.</span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ndt: Sokuhō peut se traduire par
“flash” et hon-chan par ‘“le vrai de vrai”</span>  <span style="font-weight:
400;">[Translator’s note: Sokuhō can be translated as “flash” and hon chan by
“the real thing] (vol. 2 178)</span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">This
form of meta-commentary confirms Jüngst’s assertion that “one of the
communicative functions of manga, is, in fact, to make the reader look like a
manga connoisseur” (“Translating manga” 60).</span> <span style="font-weight:
400;">When my daughter and I were yelling “avec ça on sera premier au hon
chan”, we were indeed celebrating in part the joy of possessing a form of
insider knowledge, marked by an insider’s language.</span>  <span
style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, the English translation could
not be more different. As early as page 2, the French version goes with
“mangaka” when the English translation prefers “manga artist”. Later on,
“nemus” are translated as “rough drafts” and “storyboards” (vol. 1 104). That
version uses almost no footnotes - they appear mostly to translate signs, and
at least once for an untranslatable pun - and has to make do with
equivalences. It also intervenes much more in the pictures themselves in
order to suppress potentially unintelligible elements. Thus, all the
onomatopoeia are replaced by western equivalents, with occasional weird
arrangements when the composition of the panels hinges on the presence of the
original sound effects, as seen on the illustration below. Note that the
“westernized” sounds are also frequently different from one version to the
other, as the unusual “sat” become “push” in the first panel, for
instance.</span>  <a

up with the composition (vol.1 47)</span></p> &nbsp;  <span
style="font-weight: 400;">Not all text in the panels is translated, but
various interventions ensure essential pieces of information are not lost:
for instance, a can of green tea, explained in a footnote in French, receives
an additional label in western type in the English version (vol.2 41).
</span><a
href="http://www.graphixia.ca/2016/08/248-read-this-way-bakuman-and-manga-
about-manga/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted by Scott
Marsden</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the English version also
includes “Read this way” arrows, which are nowhere to be found in the French
translation.</span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, the
strategy here is that of transparency, or as Jüngst put it, borrowing from
Eugene Nida, this is a strategy of “dynamic equivalence”, in which as much as
possible is adapted to made intelligible to the target culture (“Translating
manga” 50-51). The process is incomplete, of course, since the English
version is unflipped, and retains the “authentic” form of the tankobon, the
small black-and-white collection in book form among other markers of
“Japaneseness”. It does suggest however a very different ideal reader. As
Marsden put it : “There are multiple points in [Bakuman] where it feels [the
Japanese] culture is self-reflexively being pushed, explained, introduced to
an outside and captive audience.” The French version takes up the text as its
own game, makes the translation process overt and adds another layer of
educational or didactic content, sometimes running at cross purpose with what
Ohba and Obata are trying to achieve.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
It entertains the possibility of serving as an how-to to publishing in Japan,
for specialist readers.  Thibaud Defief indicates that Kana planned at one
point to make available a companion web-page, which would have gone even
further in elucidating and explaining the cultural specificities on display
in the series.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> By contrast, the
English version is conceived as an entry text, for readers deemed unfamiliar
with the conventions (the “Read this way” arrows) and uninterested in
acquiring knowledge about Japan besides the boundaries explicitly installed
in the diegesis.</span>  &nbsp;  <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a

alt="aomori" width="634" height="1107" /></a>One final telling example may
help sum up these differences. At one point in the second volume, the editors
of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jump </span></i><span
style="font-weight: 400;">drive to a faraway town to meet with the boy-genius
Eiji Niizuma (vol. 2 45). The caption in the establishing panel simply reads
“Aomori”. The English version leaves it this way. The French version, by
contrast, adds a footnote indicating that Aomori is the name of a prefecture
in the North of Japan. Educational comics, indeed.</span>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
