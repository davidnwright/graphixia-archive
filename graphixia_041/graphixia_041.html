<p>In this second post about Scott Pilgrim (you can read the first one <a title="#38 Scott Pilgrim World 1, Level 1 (Book 1): Canadian, eh?" href="http://www.graphixia.cssgn.org/2011/08/30/38-scott-pilgrim-world-1- level-1-book-1-canadian-eh/">here</a>), I'm going to focus on Ramona and her role in the series as a perfect example of a Manic Pixie Dream Girl (though Bryan Lee O'Malley plays with this convention to a certain extent).</p>

<p>A Manic Pixie Dream Girl (MPDG), if you're not familiar with the term, is a common stock character particularly popular in the boy-centric genres of graphic narratives, hipster indie films, and video games.  The term was coined by Nathan Rabin <a href="http://origin.avclub.com/articles/the-bataan-death-march-of- whimsy- case -file-1-eliza,15577/">in a review of the film <em>Elizabethtown </em>written for the Onion AV Club in 2007</a>. (The same publication later put together a list of MPDGs, <a href="http://http://www.avclub.com/articles/wild-things-16-films-featuring- manic-pixie-dream-g,2407/">available here</a>.)  MPDGs exist as static characters -- quirky and adorable, eccentric and girly, they are <em>different</em> from other girls in the life of our male protagonist, and they exist solely to <em>teach him about life </em>and <em>change how he thinks about the world</em>.  These are <em>profound, transformative </em>figures. They just, you know, don't get to have motivations, goals, or intentions of their own.  Because they're too busy being <em>profoundly eccentric and adorable</em>.  Think Natalie Portman in <em>Garden State</em>; the character only functions to redefine Zach Braff's sad slacker life.</p>

<p>Indeed, the important counterpoint to the MPDG is the man-child protagonist; a protagonist who is content in life and functional in society is not ripe for transformation and thus not primed for the MPDG experience.  The MPDG will move on to another sad, aimless slacker (chicks dig those, right?) and there will be no sleeper indie hit.</p>

<p>And here, Scott Pilgrim is our man-child.  And Ramona Flowers is our Manic Pixie Dream Girl.</p>

<p>The problem with the MPDG, of course, is that she isn't an agent in her own life.  She exists solely to make a better man of the protagonist; through her whimsy and beauty, she helps him find his focus and set goals for his life.  She's can't afford to be multidimensional because her task is singular.  So all MPDGs end up being the same.</p>

<p>In the Scott Pilgrim series, though, much of the archetypal issues around MPDG characters are right on the surface.  Ramona puts the "dream" in MPDG by having intercessory powers -- she is a connection between Scott's sleeping and waking world, interacting with his dream state.  She enacts the "magic" and "pixie" aspects through kicking off this supernatural, otherworldly battle-of-the-exes chaos that frames the series. She's quirky -- she listens to little-known bands, has an outsider (really American) perspective on Scott's world, and she engages with the universe on roller skates and while wearing goggles.  She's sweetly unique.</p>

<p>And she does motivate change in Scott, though Scott is so non-functional that it seems impossible that she wouldn't.  She motivates his central quest -- the slaying of the evil exes --	but she also inspires him to write (terrible) music.  Because he's Scott, he isn't immediately motivated to change his living or employment situations, but he is motivated to lie to her about these changes.  And crucially, she lacks the agency of a more fully-developed female character, which is part of what makes her so clearly a MPDG foil to Scott.  She is never present at the battles of the exes, never fighting for her own freedom from this cycle but instead content to allow Scott to intercede.  This is because ultimately, though the battles with the exes are framed around winning Ramona's love (interesting given that for much of the story Ramona's interest in Scott seems to be benevolent mild attraction rather than love), the quest is really a metaphor for Scott's own insecurities.  Through battling the exes, he is not winning Ramona's love but freeing himself from a life of passive disinterest -- and ultimately triumphing over the heartbreak surrounding Envy Adams.</p>

<p>Scott's intense loser-i-ness really suggests to me, however, that O'Malley is at least aware of the stock characters he has tapped in to and is playing with them a little.  For example, the "music" Scott is inspired to write by Ramona is comically bad:</p>

<p>The suggestion seems to be here that even the manickiest, most pixieful dream girl cannot fix the brilliant mess that is Scott Pilgrim overnight.</p>

<p>Next time: masculinity and the role of fighting in the Scott Pilgrim universe.</p>
