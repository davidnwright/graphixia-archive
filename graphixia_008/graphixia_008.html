<p>In the graphic narrative, identity is iconic; represented through costume, aesthetic style, and visual metaphor. However, identity in graphic narrative is also represented through a fracturing of reader expectations set by the medium itself. Prone to reading left to right, joining images over blank gutters, and assembling various elliptical moments, readers of the graphic narrative constantly assemble and disassemble identities and the narratives that give those identities their shape. Following the principles of reader participation outlined above, the aesthetic principles that inform representations of identity in the graphic narrative deserve closer scrutiny. If we take as a normative model the fractured central character that dominates the genre, the reassembly and disassembly of the reader plays an important role in the reader's ongoing interpretation of the text. Unlike other literary forms, how something looks on the page is central to the understanding of a character's identity.</p>

<p>Central to representing the fractured and disillusioned central characters that dominate the graphic narrative—and indeed the examples explored here so far: Jimmy Corrigan, Bruce Wayne, the superheroes of Watchmen, and Bruce Bechdel-is the fractured pagespace. Virtually all graphic narratives violate the	expectations of the genre at some point: crossing gutters, combining panels, repeating imagery across panels. Rarely does the traditional 9, 12, 16 panel grid remain intact over the course of a full-length narrative. In particular, narratives that feature characters in search of an identity emphasize the aesthetic possibilities offered by fracturing the expectations of the medium. These artistic choices-breaking the border, splitting characters in half, obscuring details-represent a further metaphor through which the reader can engage with and conceptualize emerging, and collapsing, identities.

<p>These aesthetic metaphors, in which the fractured expectations of the genre stand in for latent or emergent psychological or physical states, work much like literary tropes such as irony, self-referential narrative voices, dialects / dictions / alliterations, or a suddenly altered narrative sequence. And, as with literary tropes, aesthetic metaphors have varying degrees of interpretive complexity.</p>
<p>On a somewhat simplistic level, the artist relies on subtle shifts in the frame to indicate time and, to some extend, emotion.</p>

<p>In the above panels from <em>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth</em>, the suicide of a man in a Superman suit is recorded not in the continuous tracking of his fall, but in the	presentation of a before and after sequence. Subtle changes in the composition of the panels-a car moves out of the frame, the cyclist moves on, some people move forward, the red and blue figure move from top of the building to the pavement-suggest the passage of time. Moreover, the positioning of the figures in the frame suggest varying degrees of acknowledgment and attention. What the frames capture is silence and stasis, two of the main thematic elements of <em>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth</em>. The static and unchanging art, then, stands in for Jimmy Corrigan’s static and unchanging identity.</p>

<p>Another aesthetic metaphor is represented through Bruce Bechdel’s superhuman power to "spin garbage... into gold." While certainly his skills at making something good out of something lousy reflect an ongoing metaphor in the novel about Bruce's coping mechanism for an unfulfilled life in a heterosexual prison, the art does not represent the "garbage" and the "gold" any differently. Both appear in the same blue and white palette, with the same artistic signature of Alison Bechdel. This approach reinforces Bruce's own dissatisfaction with his attempts to turn garbage into gold: they are ultimately unsuccessful, the do not help him cope, and the world remains coloured by the pressure of his repressed identity.</p>

<p>That "He was an alchemist of appearance, a savant of surface, a Daedalus of décor" is a further nod to his command of surface representations. Indeed, Daedalus curses his own creations, and laments that they are the cause for all his strife. The aesthetic metaphors plays out further when one considers Alison Bechdel's artistic signature. The drawing is neither "realistic" nor inadequate. In fact, the art itself further suggests the issues of surface representation, which can never hope to capture the complex depths of a character's identity.</p>

<p>To this end, note Bechdel's fractured head when her character confronts her father's corpse. Disengaged from all the surface elements that identified her father, she resorts to finding another marker that will identify him. Neither the mark, nor the "revealed" Bruce Bechdel are apparent in Alison Bechdel's artwork. However, the psychological shock of her father's corpse is represented through the divided head, which is disassembled by the gutter.</p>

<p>The fractured representation of a central character is a common artistic trope for characters who are wrestling with repressed or emergent identities. Returning to <em>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth</em>, we see Jimmy divided across three panels by Chris Ware. Occurring at the moment he confronts his sister in the hospital, the page and panels suggest levels of irony and emotional resonance not present in the words, or indeed the narrative itself. The ironic referentiality of Jimmy's sniffling nose, Superman sweatshirt and fractured leg evokes the juvenile nature of Jimmy's identity and the "unsuperness" of his character. As well, the panels, which fracture Jimmy's body, also end at his fractured leg, further reinforcing his broken identity. Moving across the page, the panels frequently juxtapose Jimmy and his sister emphasizing similarities and oppositions. While their may well be racial—or colour (red / blue)—differences, the emotional resonance of the situation transcends.</p>

<p>Again, Ware's artistic signature slows down the action in order to have the reader assemble and reassemble the situation in which Jimmy finds himself. The reader takes part in the same mental gymnastics of comprehension that Jimmy himself is going through. Like Jimmy, the reader struggles to make sense of the situation and to make sense of Jimmy’s emotional state. In short, through the aesthetic metaphors in the panels above, the reader actively participates in the identity crisis that preoccupies Jimmy Corrigan. The visual cues push the reader to engage actively in reassembling the broken character-be it Jimmy Corrigan, or Bruce Bechdel.</p>

<p>Finally, the artistic elements noted above can be brought together to emphasize or exaggerate the reader's stake in a character’s identity. Perhaps the best encapsulation of the kind of dominant fractured identity we have been discussing is one of Batman’s arch nemeses: Harvey Dent, or "Two-Face." One of the more innovative manoeuvres of Frank Miller’s <em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</em> is his breaking of the expectations of the genre. Miller frequently erases panel lines, eliminates gutters, and complicates the logic of the pagespace in order to emphasize elements of a character's identity. In the example below, we are introduced to the supposedly reformed Two-Face. Zooming in on Arkham Asylum, we are first greeted by The Joker in room 601, as we pass to room 602-by no accident an even number; where The Joker is odd, Harvey is at least "even"-the representation of Harvey Dent is split over two panels by a gutter. Dividing the conversation of the short and tall doctors, and metaphorically insinuating Harvey's still-fractured psyche, the gutter makes the reader reassemble Harvey into the villain s/he knows.</p>

<p>The reader's reconstruction of Harvey Dent and the panel's eventual merging to represent an obscured, "cured," Two-Face creates a tension in what the artist represents and what the reader performs. Like the two doctors, the reader consistently works to repair the fractured character represented in the narrative. The reader's reconstruction of the character, fractured by the story-teller's reliance on memory, masks, and metaphor is the ultimately salvation of the character’s identity.</p>

<p>Like Bruce Bechdel, the author of the graphic narrative represents a fractured or obscured version of reality-one which answers to the expectations of the craft.<p>

<p>Indeed, the role of the artist in representing character	in the graphic novel is as a Daedalus-like figure who isconstantly both inventing and disassembling labyrinths of identity, history, and narrative.</p>
