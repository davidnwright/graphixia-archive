<p>Perhaps the most striking feature of the Batman: Year One story arc by Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli is how little Batman is in it. He’s there alright, but his story of trying out his skills on the streets of the East Side of Gotham and discovering his bat-based superhero identity plays second fiddle to the existential crisis of Lieutenant James Gordon, who has just been transferred to Gotham from Chicago. Gordon is thrown into a department that is corrupt from the Commissioner on down; his marriage is in crisis; and he’s about to become a father. While Bruce Wayne’s memory of the childhood trauma of seeing his parents killed by a petty criminal appears in the narrative, his present, apart from being stabbed and shot from time to time, is untroubled. All the angst belongs to Gordon.</p>

<p>Year One tells the story of James Gordon and Bruce Wayne/Batman forming their partnership in an alternating, initially parallel structure. Each character provides an internal voice over, Gordon in yellow (nicotine stained?) text boxes and Wayne/Batman in white. The establishing panels show Gordon taking the train from Chicago to Gotham while Bruce Wayne flies into the city after twelve years abroad. Gordon has a window seat in a jammed train car that he’s been on for 12 hours. The woman beside him is breast-feeding a child (symbolic perhaps of Gordon’s impending paternity); people are sleeping and checking their watches; luggage bins are jammed overhead. These details show that Gordon is down “in” the world, enmeshed in it, trapped in it. Reality is too much with him. Wayne, meanwhile, is above this world and its discomforts: “From here, it’s clean shafts of concrete and snowy rooftops.... From here it looks like an achievement.”</p>

<p>And when Wayne thinks to himself that he should have taken the train to get closer to Gotham’s reality, it only illustrates his voyeuristic desire to go slumming. When he takes himself to the extra-corrupt East Side to test his crime-fighting skills, the effect is the same. Miller and Mazzucchelli maintain this contrast between the characters and their worlds until the very end of the narrative when they come together to form an alliance. So the story of Batman: Year One is that of a relationship between two men with two different realities that dictate their motivations and abilities to act. Gordon needs Batman as a kind of extra-legal supplement while Bruce Wayne needs Gordon to give birth to Batman and ground him in the world of crime and the law.</p>

<p>Gordon is an archetypal tough cop hero: disgusted yet incorruptible, but not above taking out a little extracurricular vengeance on fellow officers who do him wrong. But Gordon’s private life creates the narrative tension, not his struggle against corruption. His disgust with the world makes him wonder whether family life is even possible. With a patriarchal arrogance, he doubts whether evil Gotham, and the larger world that it represents, is a place for women and children.</p>

<p>Furthermore, he and Barbara fight constantly.... Things don’t look good. In spite of his efforts to stay faithful to Barbara, Gordon finds himself attracted to Detective Sarah Essen. They go out for coffee regularly after work and end up kissing in the rain [1]. Police Commissioner Loeb tries to use this relationship to blackmail Gordon but Gordon nullifies the threat by coming clean with Barbara.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Gordon is tangled up in both the gritty world of crime and the complicated world of domesticity that ultimately justifies fighting crime in the first place. Gordon represents the tangle, the knot of existence that makes us act. Bruce Wayne, in contrast, is free of all that. He has no job, and he has a butler, not a spouse. His disengagement highlights Gordon’s entanglement all the more, as Gordon’s visit to Wayne Manor shows. For some reason, Gordon brings Barbara along as he tries to figure out whether Wayne could be Batman: “Better than having Barbara stay at home and worry about being so overdue...” (4.8.1). Bruce appears in a dressing gown next to a lingerie-clad woman whom he says doesn’t speak any language he understands. While it is obvious that Wayne is putting up a front here--portraying himself as a dissipated playboy who couldn’t possibly be Batman--the fact that he is able to put up such a front says it all. He has no romantic entanglements to drag him into the domestic world, unlike Gordon, who must live in the world of affairs, babies, and marriage counsellors. The problem	with Bruce Wayne’s freedom/disengagement is that it doesn’t legitimate his actions. Crime fighting becomes just a peculiar and perhaps perverse hobby.</p>

<p>Selina Kyle, who transforms into Catwoman after seeing Batman on the news, represents an intermediate space between Gordon and Wayne [2]. Selina, a dominatrix/prostitute, not only has a multitude of cats, which gives rise to a nice cat lady/Catwoman visual joke, but also a “ward” in Holly Robinson, a teenaged prostitute. Selina is both a part of the “vice” of the city and a person with ties, however makeshift. Again, by contrast, we see that Bruce Wayne has no one to look after, not even a cat. Indeed, the only other person in his life, Alfred, looks after him, nursing his wounds and fetching his tights [3]. Bruce Wayne meets Holly and Selena as he cruises the East Side of Gotham, looking for some criminals to test his skills on. Even though he takes steps to disguise himself, Bruce is clearly out of place and his disguise is not convincing. Holly’s pimp makes him for a cop.</p>

<p>And when Bruce tackles the pimp, Holly stabs him in the thigh in punishment for his outsider meddling. Without his “otherworldly" bat persona, Bruce Wayne is a flop as a crime fighter; he is another trouble maker in a bad neighborhood [4]. A costume and persona, however, are only part of what he requires. Mostly he needs a connection, an investment. Without them, he is just a bored socialite working out his psychodrama in public. Consequently, Miller and Mazzucchelli set up the climax of Batman Year One in a way that makes the public and the private converge as it brings Gordon and Batman together as a team. When Commissioner Loeb’s attempt to blackmail Gordon fails, The Roman, a gangster with his fingers in the pie of city politics, sends his nephew Johnny to kidnap Gordon’s newborn. In assigning the task, The Roman says, “Once a man becomes a father he is never truly free” (4.16.5). </p>

<p>The domesticity that entangles Gordon in the conventions of domestic reality becomes the tool to entangle him in the corruption that everyone else in the Gotham police department and city politics partakes in. On that level, the baby is symbol of Gordon’s commitment to marriage, fatherhood, domesticity. The baby itself is a kind of entanglement.</p>

<p>But the baby also represents a fresh start, a freedom from corruption that the kidnapping would taint. If the kidnapping is successful Gordon’s bleak assessment of Gotham comes true: it is no place for a child. So if Batman doesn’t save the baby, any notion of the city being worth saving dies. But Batman isn’t the saviour here, Bruce Wayne is. When Alfred offers to fetch his tights prior to his intervening in the kidnapping, Bruce says, “never during the day” (4.16.3). Bruce Wayne as Bruce Wayne saves the baby because the symbol of Batman requires something connected to domestic reality behind it, an alter ego who has some connection to the world that James Gordon lives in every day. When I say “requires” here I mean that Batman Year One suffers an anxiety that Batman will be (and perhaps has been) disconnected from reality, and that this story of beginnings intends to ensure the connection between the superhero and social realism. The irony here is that Miller and Mazzucchelli make the connection to realism symbolically. When Bruce Wayne emerges from the mud of the river proffering the baby to Gordon, it signifies that connection. This is not a sci-fi fantasy world of formidable evil powers threatening the planet [5]. Rather, it is a world of everyday problems of people trying to make it in a corrupt political world. So...Bruce Wayne needs to save the baby that links those worlds to legitimate Batman’s functioning. Once Bruce saves Gordon’s baby and through doing so establishes a “relationship” with the lieutenant, Batman, as a meaningful symbol, can begin to work to save Gotham.</p>

<p>Bruce is not just meddling here, he’s giving birth to something, a symbolic transaction with Gordon that is a deal to work together to keep public corruption and crime from infecting the domestic world. Gordon gives Wayne an investment in the personal, domestic realm where people have bonds with each other, and Wayne provides Gordon a “deus ex machina” to fight corruption and crime in Gotham.  In the symbolic sense, the baby is theirs, and the muddy waters of the river provide an appropriate birthing scene. </p>

<p>The narrative ends with news of a threat to poison the Gotham Reservoir: “Calls himself the Joker.” The final image is of Gordon smiling, and smoking a pipe: “I’ve got a friend coming who might be able to help. Should be here any minute” (4. 25.5). It’s the first time in the story that we have seen Gordon with any level of contentment. And, with Bruce Wayne having stitched himself into the social fabric through his baby rescue, Batman can be freed to fight the wacko villains one only finds in comic books.</p>

<p>[1] In a neat allusive moment, Gordon and Essen have coffee in a diner called “The Hopper”.</p>

<p>[2] It’s curious that Selina Kyle gets no internal monologue/voice over like the male characters. Why not? How does the Catwoman element of the story fit in?</p>

<p>[3] Alfred represents the butler as masculine mother.</p>

<p>[4] Part of the Batman mythology concerns why Bruce Wayne needs a costume to fight crime, how it is necessary for him to become a symbol. We might argue that “becoming symbol” is a kind of absolution from the social world.</p>

<p>[5] The “goofy” world of Batman that we see most prominently in the campy Adam West TV show is contained in Commissioner Loeb’s office, which is stuffed with pop memorabilia, including a “Peanuts” lamp.</p>
