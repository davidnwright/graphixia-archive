<p>In <em>Louis Riel: A Comic Strip Biography</em> Chester Brown treats his subject not just as a political martyr but as an unconventional religious one, whose spirituality dances with mental illness. Riel renounces Catholicism for a private mysticism, as if he were the founder of a new religion.The cover picture of Lous Riel: a Comic Strip Biography features Riel on a mountain top, like Moses waiting for God's word. But inside the volume we see a difficult character to judge because of the way Riel's public political activism intersects with his seemingly private religious feeling. So the reader is left wondering: Is Riel a saint? A lunatic? Or just a political figurehead? The difficulty in answering these questions is what makes Brown’s graphic narrative interesting. Brown doesn’t simply serve Riel up as an uncomplicated cultural hero. Rather, he presents him as a tormented soul who cannot figure out who he is or what he is supposed to mean.</p>

<p>The arc of the story shows Riel increasingly having less	interest in the political aspects of the Metis rebellion as he becomes more self-involved, mystical, and, perhaps, crazy. He still believes in his cause, but he seems not as willing to pursue military and political ends. Furthermore, he has had a spell in the asylum, having been committed for megalomania. We might think of megalomania as a synonym for “power mad,” but that is not quite it. Rather, he believes above all that he is right. Riel has the disease of religious and political true believers. For a mental illness, it's pretty heroic. </p>

<p>The framing of Louis Riel: A Comic Strip Biography belies any craziness or mysticism. In fact, it suggests order and rationality. Every page contains six frames: three rows of two, as rigidly ordered as the plots of land that the Canadian government imposes on the Metis. The framing suggests containment. Indeed, compared to something like David Mazzuchelli’s Asterios Polyp which everywhere confounds comic book conventionality, Brown’s volume is indeed a “comic strip,” sequential, ordered, almost like a filmstrip in its unfolding. This disconnect between the form of the graphic narrative and its subject ironically illustrates the fact that Riel cannot be contained. There is something about him that escapes framing, even though he is continually “framed” in the sense that he is set up, falsely accused. In fact we can see the format of the “comic-strip” as prison bars. When Riel is tried and the background is solid black, the entrapment of the frames becomes obvious. </p>

<p>As the narrative approaches its conclusion, form and subject become more and more divergent. Riel becomes difficult to comprehend. As his brothers in arms defend themselves against the Canadians by shooting, Riel muses on the failures of the Church. He doesn’t shoot; he just sits there. He has gone from being an iconic representative of his people to a someone who seems more like a solipsist. As biography, Louis Riel is ironic. Rather than unfold Riel or reveal him, Brown shuts him up, making him more rather than less opaque.</p>
