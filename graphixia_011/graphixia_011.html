<p>David Mazzucchelli, author of <em>Asterios Polyp</em>, drew for <em>Daredevil</em> and <em>Batman</em> for DC so he well-knows the terrain of superheroes and secret identities. At first glance, <em>Asterios Polyp</em>, the story of an architect, has little to do with masked figures.  Nevertheless, Asterios’ story is haunted by doubleness and an identity  schism; it is narrated by his twin brother, Ignazio, who was still-born.  The narrative structure of <em>Asterios Polyp</em> is a curious one: Asterios is presented, drawn, and discussed, but he rarely speaks for himself, in brief speech bubbles. The narrator, meanwhile, is the source of Asterios’ trauma, unseen by Asterios except in fantasy or dream.</p>

<p>In one scene with his wife, Hana, where Asterios explains why he has video  cameras set up throughout his apartment, he confesses the absence that Ignazio’s death has left in his life. Everything in Asterios’ work as an architect testifies to this absence. His buildings are all twinned structures, and Asterios expresses pleasure at the twin towers of the World Trade Center: “The brilliance of it is that there are two of them” (112). But Asterios is a “paper architect,” which means that his buildings exist only as drawings; none of them have ever been built. The implication is that the absence of Ignazio not only inspires these twin structures but also prevents them from becoming real. The buildings are impossible.</p>

<p>Also impossible for Asterios is a relationship. In spite of the hole in his life, Asterios is too full of himself, compensating perhaps for his lack. He is egotistical and vain. He marries a sculptor, Hana Sonnenschein, but appears unable to give her equal billing in his life. When she finds success designing sets for the choreographer, Willy Illium, he grows jealous. We might say that just as the super-hero’s alter ego puts a spanner in the works of his or her romantic life, Asterios’ absent twin does the same for him. The marriage breaks up and Asterios finds himself stranded, once again “split up.”</p>

<p>In the opening sequence of frames, Asterios is dissolute, post-relationship with Hana. His apartment is in disarray: plants are dead or dying; bottles, food remains, and newspapers are scattered across the living room. A stack of overdraft notices and unpaid bills lies beside the old-fashioned telephone. He is unshaven on his bed watching a sex tape, flicking a Zippo lighter. A lightning strike hits his apartment building and the ensuing fire destroys everything he has, as if it were an apocalyptic erasure of his current life: the death of his old world and the birth of a new one.He escapes the building with the clothes on his back, a Zippo lighter, a Swiss army knife, and a watch. On his fiftieth birthday, Asterios Polyp is suddenly a tabula rasa, or at least the illusion of a tabula rasa. He escapes New York City for a fictional town called Apogee, whose name tells us that Asterios is at the furthest point from whatever it is he is orbiting: the traumatic kernel of his twinship.  He gives up architecture to become an auto mechanic and takes up with the garage owner’s family.</p>

<p>Like many literary apocalypses, Asterios’ is a failed one. Even at the farthest point from his identity center, alterity continues to haunt him. Stiffly, the garage owner, calls him “Stereo” and Stiffly’s son, Running Dog, has an alter ego of his own in an imaginary friend, mimicking Asterios’ dilemma. Asterios can get far away from his existential crisis, but there is no doubt that he is still bound by its orbit. A pivotal moment occurs when Asterios loses an eye when he is attacked in a bar. The loss of his eye affects his depth perception through parallax or stereopsis. His “twin” vision is no longer possible; he becomes a cyclops. While lying in hospital, Asterios dreams that he drives his smoking Saab into the Apogee garage to find Ignazio working there. As Ignazio recounts his story, which is Asterios’ story, Asterios gets angrier and angrier and strikes him with a wrench. He feels that his dead twin is not only mirroring him but mocking him. When he’s well enough, Asterios drives to Minnesota (the Twin Cities) for a reunion with Hana.</p>

<p>The secret identity of the super hero, when seen through the	lens of <em>Asterios Polyp</em>,  perhaps testifies to an inherent “otherness” of the self, a self  elsewhere, that can be either idealized or diminished, depending on the  psychological disposition of the subject. The superhero’s appeal  lies  in the possibility of being something or someone else. But maybe we are always someone else whenever we look in the mirror or even just think about ourselves. Just as Asterios wonders if he is somehow living Ignazio’s life, we might wonder if we are living someone else’s life, or at least a life not our own. We don’t need to have had a still-born twin to “shadowed” like Asterios is. Furthermore, <em>Asterios Polyp</em> suggests that in spite of all our efforts to disavow this otherness, it  may be inevitable. Just as Asterios appears to have abandoned his  double vision or parallax for a more humble unity, a meteorite hurtles  towards Hana’s house as Asterios sits with her in her living room.</p>
