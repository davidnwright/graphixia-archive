<p>The notion that an ordinary person could	become a super hero is an example of what the psychoanalyst Jacques	Lacan would call “the imaginary.” That is, it is a fantasy of stepping out of the symbolic order to exercise mastery over the world--the fantasy of becoming a god-like figure in other words. In Lacan’s psychoanalytic theory, the imaginary is a realm of violence, largely because someone always stands in the way of one’s assumption of full power: see the Nazis' Third Reich fantasy depending on the extermination of the Jews, or the interference of the “Indians” in the establishment of a New Canaan in America. In superhero graphic narratives, the violent nature of the imaginary is allayed by the superhero’s employing that violence against villainy. The violence of the superheroes is legitimated by the fact that they use their powers for good, not to attain tyrannical control over the world.</p>

<p>The contemporary re-visions of the superhero--<em>Watchmen</em>, <em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</em>--offer a gimlet-eyed view of this fantasy, returning the superhero to the symbolic order, re-establishing the “subjectification” of the superhero. It is as if reality is clawing the superhero back into its domain.</p>

<p>In fact, though, the (re)subjectification of the superhero has been part of the story from the beginning. There is always an Achilles heel--kryptonite, for instance--that acts as a brake on the super hero’s power. As everyone knows, the problem with being all-powerful is that it doesn’t make for much of a story. What does make for a good story, however, is an exploration of the limits of the imaginary register. To what extent can a hero can be “super” before disappearing in a puff of smoke--becoming completely implausible even to the most willing suspender of disbelief, the comic book reader.</p>

<p>The integration of the world of superhero comics into Jonathan Lethem’s <em>Fortress of Solitude</em>, a conventional (i.e. non-graphic) novel, illuminates just how elastic these limits can be. Dylan Ebdus, the protagonist of the novel, designs a suit and invents a character--Aeroman--who flies. In the novel’s most painful moment, the 13-year-old Dylan dresses in the suit to impress his first love, Heather. The scene is a perfect example of the imaginary hitting the wall of reality. Nevertheless, in the novel, the wearer of the suit and the bearer of the special ring flies. We keep waiting for the illusion to break, but it doesn’t.</p>

<p>Whatever it is flying requires--balance, poise, unhesitation, an organ for sensing air waves--he’s apparently got. His swoop begins just below the garage’s second story, two balled fists leading the charge as he curves from the expected collision with the pavement, first falling aslant, then unmistakably horizontal. (205)</p>

<p>The effect is quite the opposite of reading a superhero comic book, where we are in a receptive frame of mind regarding what the human or superhuman individual is capable of. In <em>Fortress of Solitude</em> we wait for reality to assert itself and when it doesn’t, our heads spin.</p>

<p>The flipside of this relationship between reality and the imaginary can be seen in Brad Bird’s animated film, <em>The Incredibles</em>, not only in the Incredible family’s difficulties in adjusting to suburban living after “supers” have been prohibited by law from exercising their powers, but also in the technical details involved in designing a new costume for Mr Incredible’s re-emergence. Edna Mode, the designer, pronounces “No Capes!” and goes into an account of various superheros coming a cropper because they got their capes snagged on something or other.</p>

<p>This intrusion of a kind of reality principle into the imaginary realm captures our relationship to that realm, where our willing suspension of disbelief negotiates with our concept of plausibility. We can never finally escape our subjectification to the symbolic order and its rules, not even in comic books.</p>

<p>In non-superhero graphic narratives, the concept of the imaginary manifests itself as a desire to fill a lack, to become complete. In<em> Asterios Polyp</em> that means Asterios’ longing for his still-born twin Ignazio. In <em>Ghost World</em> it means the possibility of re-inventing oneself--escaping this world and finding another one that allows full access to the personality one wishes. <em>Ghost World</em> is a particularly good example because of it’s continued leaning towards a world elsewhere because “this” world is too limiting, puts too much of a bar on subjectivity. The point here is that fulfillment is always over the horizon, never immediately possible.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that the superhero graphic narrative appears to offer access to the imaginary wholeness and power that obviously fuels much of the human imagination, the genie keeps having to be put back in the bottle. The apparent access to power rarely brings satisfaction; rather it comes with an attendant anxiety. As Umberto Eco is fond of saying, Superman never gets to save the world; rather, he’s stuck with the menial task of fighting petty crime. In fact these irritants that limit the full expression of “superiority” turn out to be saving graces. However much we might fantasize about flying, superhuman strength, we really want to stay on this side of the the symbolic order. In the end, we need to know that the imaginary is just that. Superhero graphic narratives pose the question of “what if” we could bypass all these limitations, only to reinforce them. In doing so they send us back to the realm of serious literature, which is all about what it means to be subjectified within the symbolic order.</p>
